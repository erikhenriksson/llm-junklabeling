{"text": "How AP reported in all formats from tornado-stricken regionsMarch 8, 2012\nWhen the first serious bout of tornadoes of 2012 blew through middle America in the middle of the night, they touched down in places hours from any AP bureau. Our closest video journalist was Chicago-based Robert Ray, who dropped his plans to travel to Georgia for Super Tuesday, booked several flights to the cities closest to the strikes and headed for the airport. He’d decide once there which flight to take.\nHe never got on board a plane. Instead, he ended up driving toward Harrisburg, Ill., where initial reports suggested a town was destroyed. That decision turned out to be a lucky break for the AP. Twice.\nRay was among the first journalists to arrive and he confirmed those reports -- in all formats. He shot powerful video, put victims on the phone with AP Radio and played back sound to an editor who transcribed the interviews and put the material on text wires. He then walked around the devastation with the Central Regional Desk on the line, talking to victims with the phone held so close that editors could transcribe his interviews in real time.\nRay also made a dramatic image of a young girl who found a man’s prosthetic leg in the rubble, propped it up next to her destroyed home and spray-painted an impromptu sign: “Found leg. Seriously.”\nThe following day, he was back on the road and headed for Georgia and a Super Tuesday date with Newt Gingrich’s campaign. The drive would take him through a stretch of the South that forecasters expected would suffer another wave of tornadoes.\nTo prevent running into THAT storm, Ray used his iPhone to monitor Doppler radar, zooming in on extreme cells and using Google maps to direct himself to safe routes. And then the journalist took over again.\n“When weather like that occurs, a reporter must seize the opportunity to get the news out and allow people to see, hear and read the power of nature so that they can take proper shelter,” Ray says.\nSo Ray now started to use his phone to follow the storms. He attached a small GoPro camera to his steering wheel in case a tornado dropped down in front of the car somewhere, and took video of heavy rain and hail with his iPhone. Soon, he spotted a tornado and the chase was on. He followed an unmarked emergency vehicle to Cleveland, Tenn., where he was first on the scene of the storm's aftermath.\nAgain, the tornadoes had struck in locations that were hours from the nearest AP bureau. Damage and debris, as well as a wickedly violent storm that made travel dangerous, slowed our efforts to get to the news. That wasn’t a problem in Tennessee, where our customers were well served by an all-formats report that included this text story.\n“CLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) _ Fierce wind, hail and rain lashed Tennessee for the second time in three days, and at least 15 people were hospitalized Friday in the Chattanooga area.”\nThe byline? Robert Ray.\nFor being adept with technology, chasing after news as it literally dropped from the sky and setting a standard for all-formats reporting that put the AP ahead on the most competitive news story of the day, Ray wins this week’s $300 Best of the States prize.\n© 2013 The Associated Press.

{"text": "Did you know you have two little yellow, nine-volt-battery-sized adrenal glands in your body, just chilling out, maxin’, relaxin’ all cool on top of your kidneys? Someone told me this and I checked it out. Turns out it’s true.\nIt seems as though your adrenal glands are kind of like those British Royal Guards with the big, black fuzzy hats who stand like statues in front of Buckingham Palace. They just stand there quietly, not doing much really, just enjoying the brown, slippery beach that is your kidneys.\nHowever, if anything startling should happen that requires your attention — like say you’re about to give a speech at a wedding or your hear a twig crack outside your tent or your doorbell rings in the middle of the night — then they leap into action, jumping out of their peaceful slumber to squeeze out a big dose of adrenaline right into your body, pumping you up, and turning you into a primal, warrior-like version of yourself.\nWhen tension runs high and adrenaline is secreted into your body some crazy things can happen — sometimes called the fight-or-flight response:\n- Your heart rate increases. And specifically, your body starts sending blood to all your big muscles and diverts it away from “non-critical” parts of your body, like your brain, immune system, and digestive system. I guess someone figured you could digest the sandwich after you killed the bear.\n- Your pupils dilate and you get tunnel vision. Quite literally, adrenaline also reduces your peripheral vision, which together with your big, wide pupils helps you focus on what lies ahead. You can’t quite see through walls, but if a crow is diving at your eyes you might be able to swat it away better.\n- Your body gets ready to boot it. In addition to the rising heart rate, your body starts turning lots more stuff into sugar, raising your blood sugar level and filling you with energy. You might not even feel pain as easily, so the raspberry bushes that shred your legs when you’re running out of the forest won’t slow you down.\nBut what’s also great about adrenalin is that, first of all, you don’t have to control it. It just sort of kicks it into high gear when it figures you could use a boost. I think it’s kind of cool knowing that your body will help you out when you need it most. Punch me in the face and suddenly my internal British Royal Guard tosses away his fuzzy, black cap, cracks his neck, and rolls up his sleeves.\nAnd really, isn’t it that little dose of adrenalin that helps you do a better job when you need it most? It’s a natural upper, helping you nail the big speech, ace the final exam, or perhaps flee both of those scenes.\nThere’s a reason some people become adrenaline junkies. The boost you get from your adrenal glands waking up and getting out of bed is intoxicating. Sure, it fuzzes up your thinking a bit and sends your intestines on sabbatical, but it sure does pump you up. And remember: when something important in your life is about to happen, you can count on your good pal adrenaline to be there, juicing you up, helping you fight the good fight.\nJian Ghomeshi is the host of my favorite radio show. It’s called Q and broadcasts across North America every morning. Jian is a big friend and fan of 1000 Awesome Things and The Book of Awesome and I’m really excited because he just released his first book. It’s called 1982 and is a beautifully written memoir about growing up in the suburbs of Toronto and trying to fit in. (My kind of book!) For those of you who love reading, I think he’s a fantastic writer and am really excited to recommend this book.", "id": "<urn:uuid:803e14c3-dc2e-43d6-b75d-6fb3981c4fe6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://1000awesomethings.com/2012/09/24/934-adrenaline/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:11:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9479914307594299, "token_count": 821, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Five Reasons I Love Boston\n1. The water.\nThe Atlantic Ocean, as deep and true as denim, so blue it melts into the sky, horizonless. And the Charles River. Years from now, I’ll remember riding the Red Line from Boston into Cambridge at night – the way the lights streak across the black water like crayons lined up in a box.\nAfter my childhood in Seattle to my college years in Boston, I don’t think I could live anywhere but a coast.\n2. The seasons.\nI always come back to school right at the tail end of summer. Heat sinks into the subway stations like poisonous gas, and whatever you wear, it’s too much fabric. With October right around the corner, though, fall settles in. I love the way golden light fans out from behind buildings and through alleyways. Yellow leaves get stuck in the rain currents along the sidewalk. It’s my favorite time of year.\nBoston has also taught me the true meaning of winter. Winter is wet hair freezing solid on the way to class, two pairs of socks, ears tucked into scarves. Torrential flurries of snowflakes that burn skin. Frankly, winter is miserable.\nBut then there’s that one morning – and it’s always a morning, and you’re never quite prepared for it – when you step outside and every tree in Boston has bloomed. Cherry blossoms opened like pale pink popcorn, blue skies, tender green leaves. It’s such a miracle that this can happen despite the sheets of ice and crazy wind tunnels, it makes everything worthwhile.\n3. The quirkiness.\nI love the farmer’s markets all over the city, the narrow brick alleys begging to be explored, the late night restaurants in Chinatown. Boston constantly surprises me. Today I discovered the food trucks – why didn’t I know that Boston has food trucks??\n4. The history.\nA handful of the founding fathers are buried mere blocks from campus. I walk through the oldest park in America to get to my boyfriend D-’s apartment in Beacon Hill, a neighborhood of gas lamps and weathered brick. Everywhere you look, historic churches stand between skyscrapers. The contrast is astonishing.\n5. These amazing people.\nSure, most of them aren’t from Boston. A-’s from Colorado, C-’s from LA, and S- is all the way from Guam. But nine months of the year, they’re all mine. They make Boston feel like home.\nWhy do you love _______?", "id": "<urn:uuid:64f968bf-14bc-48bd-a1bb-a43b3f4a3c3d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://17andbaking.com/2012/09/30/five-reasons-i-love-boston/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=fd9f0e7c6a", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9266799688339233, "token_count": 550, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "TRIBE CHIEF TRIS DAZZLES AT DISH, FLUBS IN FIELD IN SIXTH STRAIGHT TIGER WIN\nBy Calvin J. Butterworth\nJune 19, 1924\nTy Cobb can tell you. Personally causing your team's loss when you are managing said team can be a devastating turn of events. Players who look to you for leadership and support are left in a rudderless abyss and often need to find dry morning land on their own.\nSuch was the case at Navin Field today, as the suddenly resurgent Indians re-visited our neighborhood, fresh from taking three of four from the Yankees and before that, four straight from Boston. It was their misfortune, though, to run into the Earl of Whitehill, who has been spinning masterpieces of hurling lately. Skipper Speaker doubled off him with two outs in the 1st, but Riggs Stephenson, back from an ailment, left him there with a short fly. Joe Sewell and Speaker singled with two outs again two innings later, but this time Riggs grounded out.\nMeanwhile Harry Heilman, hero of yesterday, was stranding runners aplenty for our side, failing after three straight Fred Haney hits off Joe Shaute. The game remained scoreless through the first six frames, a remarkable achievement when one considers the power of these clubs' collective clout.\nWith one out in the Tiger 7th, though, Frank O'Rourke reached on his third single. Whitehill then lofted a fly straight out to Speaker. The sun had been playing peek-and-seek all afternoon behind thin clouds, and as the ball reached its pinnacle it was evident Tris was having trouble locating it. Sure enough, he threw up his mitt at the last moment and was as stunned as the thousands of witnesses were to have it nick off the top and bound insanely toward the deep fence. By the time he tracked down the sphere, O'Rourke had scampered home and Whitehill was standing on third base. Shaute was visibly unnerved, threw a muffin-ball to Rigney, and Topper rammed it into the corner for a double and 2-0 lead!\nEgg still dripping down his face, Speaker singled with one out in the 8th, Stephenson followed with one of his own, but the Earl induced a twin killing off the bat of George Burns to end the threat. Another minor disturbance went by the wayside in the 9th, Whitehill had his tidy 10-hit shutout, and Detroit had won six games in a row.\nCobb was thrilled later about the result. \"Home runs? Who needs 'em? We got more line hits in our bureau than a buccaneer's got dubloons in the sand.\" Someone mentioned the error by Speaker was a lucky break and Cobb froze the reporter with a baleful stare before ducking into the nearest shower stall.\nCLE 000 000 000 - 0 10 1\nDET 000 000 20x - 2 8 0\nOnly other American League game today:\nat BROWNS 10-14-0, WHITE SOX 8-10-2\nOne of the more thrilling spectacles of this or any year, and no one expected it. The Chicagos have had their way with St. Louis all season, and with Sloppy Thurston staked to a 6-2 after three on the horrific Ray Kolp, Brownie fans were already making their dinner plans. It was actually 8-2 in the last of the 6th when four Browns singles and a key flub from Bill Barrett gave St. Louis four runs and put them back in the contest. A Pat Collins single in the 8th pulled them to 8-7, as great relief twirling from George Grant and Hub Pruett kept matters close. But after Tobin and pinch-hitter Severeid both singled to begin the last of the 9th, up stepped famous batsman George Sisler. He picked out a Thurston curve, swung mightily and cracked it on a magnificent arc out to right. Hooper gave chase but ran out of room as the ball dropped into the Sportsman Park pavilion amidst a gaggle of celebrating fans.\nWashington will be in Shibe Park tomorrow, now with a 2-game advantage, while the Red Sox will take their losing streak into Yankee Stadium.\n|AMERICAN LEAGUE through Thursday, June 19|\n|Chicago White Sox||38||25||.603||2|\n|New York Yankees||31||31||.500||8.5|\n|St. Louis Browns||27||36||.429||13|\n|Boston Red Sox||24||37||.393||15|", "id": "<urn:uuid:2c08e1d4-9706-41d8-84dc-ee2939758c81>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://1924andyouarethere.blogspot.com/2009_07_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:54:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9647520184516907, "token_count": 979, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Noise", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "|Tommy Pi - Trance Experience|\n|Written by Paul|\nTommy Pi started DJing at small private parties at the age of 13. He was always into music, so it was no surprise when he went on and bought his first equipment, some Omnictronic Turntables and a small Gemini mixer. From that day on he always used any chance he got to play at parties, and it wasn't long before his day would come, for him play on a big stage in front of more than 50 people! There was a big party in his home town of Minden (North Germany) with DJ's like Monika Kruse, Alex Lück and others and Tommy thought that it would be great to play there. So he went straight to the promotor and said 'Hey man, I'm from here, I'm a DJ, too so can I play?'Not thinking that this would ever be possible, the promotor said, 'Ok, just come here tomorrow, and you can play for an hour'. That was the birth of DJ Tommy Pi.\nFrom then on, Tommy played in clubs like PW1 in Porta Westfalica, or Go!Parc in Herford. He also played the Go!Parc on Tour Events alongside Alex Lück and others. The biggest day was yet to come! On 21st of October 2000 Tommy and his mate Dee-B had the chance to play alongside Piet Blank at the Einslive Party in Minden, invited by Piet himself. It was a big party and Tommy was very nervous and shaking as he put the needle on the vinyl for the first record 'DJ Culture'. He played on that evening and the crowd were fantastic and it was a lot of fun for both, Tommy and Dennis.\nThe crowning Glory for Tommy was in 2002 when he was voted as 'Best DJ' by the local magazine 'Stadtgeflüster'. Tommy was the second DJ to win this trophy, after Timo Maas won it the year before.\nIn 2003 Tommy started his weekly Radio Show 'Trance Experience' on PureDJ. The show is streamed every Monday from 8-10 pm CET. Now, 1Mix is rebroadcasting the show from October 2008 Tuesdays from 4-6pm.\nIn February 2005 Tommy's second Radio Show 'Trance Experience ETN Edition' was started on ETN.fm as a monthly one-hour radio show.\nAll of Tommy's mixes and Radio Shows are now available as a Podcast on iTunes,podcast.de or mypodcast.com.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7e6216ca-0a01-498d-85f7-7d4aed299c98>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://1mix.co.uk/trance-shows/tommy-pi-trance-experience.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:54:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9856569170951843, "token_count": 527, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Iran’s Wild Card for Defense Stocks In 2012 … Dividends Hang in the Balance (ATK, GD, LLL, LMT, RTN)December 28, 2011 by Jon C. Ogg\nIt is no secret that Iran is a saber-rattling nation. The country wants to be relevant on the global stage so much that it keeps up with its nuclear ambitions regardless of global trading sanctions and regardless of efforts from the Western nations trying to stop it. And now the big news is not the nuclear front, but an Iranian minister claiming that Iran could effectively block the flow of traffic through the Gulf of Hormuz easier than drinking a glass of water.\nIn the age of austerity and military budgets being slashed to deal with deficits, Iran has a chance of turning 2012 accidentally into the year of defense stocks. Alliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK), General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD), L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) could all hang in the balance. With operations all but gone in Iraq and with the trend in Afghanistan being one of leaving, Iran is the obvious wild card.\nIf anything real ever comes out of Iran’s religious political leadership other than how neat it is to stone people over adultery, how it denies that alternative lifestyles exist in Iran, or about how it wants nuclear power for peace, this may end up making the sell-off seen in defense stocks a bargain of the century. If (or when) Iran ever announces that it has built a nuclear bomb, it likely is going to be difficult for Western nations to slash and burn too far on the defense spending. Before running out and loading up on warfare stocks, please remember … this is all “If, Then.”\nAlliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK) trades at $56.15 and the 52-week trading range is $51.26 to $78.17. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $71.70, implying upside of roughly 28%. Alliant Tech currently has a lower dividend yield against peers with only a payout rate of about 1.4% and shares are up about 4% since the Thanksgiving break. Alliant is highly dependent on the business of selling bullets and it no longer has the booster-rocket business from Space Shuttle launches.\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) trades at $66.15 and the 52-week trading range is $53.95 to $78.27. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $76.16, implying upside of about 15%. General Dynamics currently yields about 2.9%.\nL-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL) trades at $66.85 and the 52-week trading range is $58.30 to $88.55. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $71.64, implying upside of only about 7%. L-3 yields about 2.7% in its dividend and shares are up about 5% from the Thanksgiving break.\nLockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) trades at $81.25 and the 52-week trading range is $66.36 to $82.43. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $80.12, implying that the stock is above a full-value price. Its dividend yield is quite high at about 5% and shares are up almost 5% since its $1.00 dividend was reflected in the stock in late November.\nRaytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) trades at $48.50 and the 52-week trading range is $38.35 to $53.12. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $49.53, implying upside of only about 2%. Its dividend yield is currently about 3.7% and shares are up about 14% since the Thanksgiving break.\nUnless something new comes out of North Korea, or unless there is more unrest in the Middle East, Iran is the big worry for the country today. With such high payouts from some defense contractors, it is worth wondering just how high some of the payouts can rise during the proliferation of austerity.\nJON C.

{"text": "In Suzanne Collins’s wildly popular Hunger Games books, children are chosen by lottery to serve as gladiators who fight to the death. The Games are televised for the entertainment of the general population. Collins models her games on ancient Rome, where gladiators fought to the death and slaves were fed to the lions. She even names her dystopian world Panem, after the Latin word for bread, as in bread and circuses, panem et circenses. Bread and circuses refers to the cheap trick of persuading the masses to cheer for a lion or a slave, for one gladiator or another, rather than participating in or observing or acting to change the political arena. Keep the general population fed with the most basic of food and keep their minds off of rebellion with the distractions of entertainment.\nAs I read through Lenore Skenazy’s blog and watched her appearances on various chat shows, I kept thinking, “Bread and circuses.” There is so much air time to fill, so television producers and headline writers make news of the Mommy Wars. Free Range Parenting vs. Helicopter Parenting. Stay-at-home Mothers vs. Working Mothers. Breast vs. Bottle. Sleep Training vs. Attachment Parenting. Blah, blah, blah. In one blogger’s take on the issue, she asks, “Free range parenting versus helicopter parenting: which team are YOU on?” Really? We have to pick teams? These issues are so much more complex than x vs. y, but so much easier to digest if packaged in a familiar us vs. them format.\nIn one clip, Skenazy and another parent appear on Anderson Cooper to replay how Skenazy was able to help this woman who is so much of the helicopter persuasion that in public washrooms she feels it necessary to go right into the bathroom stall with her daughter. “Doesn’t everybody?” this mother quips, when the audience gasps. They feed this woman to the lions, then they rescue her, undo her public shame with a public reformation of her extreme and errant ways.\nUnless it’s extreme, it’s not entertainment, so we have thown up on the screen all kind of wild and wacky folk on reality shows who hoard or dumpster dive for coupons for hundreds of free sticks of deodorant, saving up against Armageddon.\nWhat good does any of this do? Silly distractions from the reality lived in the murky middle ground.\nI respect Skenazy and her husband’s decision to let their son ride the subway alone. I respect her desire to move away from a culture where kids are kept bubble wrapped. I respect her initiative to create a television show that capitalizes on the buzz that her son’s subway ride generated. But I resent the circus atmosphere of telling the stories of bubble wrapped or free range kids.\nWhy do mothers keep feeding each other to the lion of artificially polarized public opinion?", "id": "<urn:uuid:1ac6d51e-62f3-46ac-b505-0adc65876218>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://4mothers1blog.com/2012/04/24/a-big-silly-distraction/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:05Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9376577734947205, "token_count": 620, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "(Fort Worth, TX) On Sunday, March 4th, The 5Choir from Saint Andrew Catholic Church in Fort Worth appeared at the 2012 Spirit Games at Nolan Catholic High School. The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation brought together Fort Worth's Catholic kids of all ages for the fifth annual SPIRIT GAMES, a day of competition and fun. The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation is committed to offering financial aid to local children who seek the strength and values of a Catholic education and to those courageous children and their families whose lives are afflicted with cancer.\nThe 5Choir played and sang for the Mass with Bishop Kevin Vann, and played a short set of songs after Mass. The band covered songs featured on local Christian station KLTY, such as \"Your Grace is Enough\" and \"The Revelation Song\" as well as Catholic favorites like \"Here I Am, Lord\". For the Ordinary of the Mass, they played selections from the new Mass of St. Frances Cabrini by Kevin Keil, director of Liturgy and Music at Holy Cross Catholic Church in The Colony.\nThe members of the 5Choir are: Jed Chatterton, Mike Hyry & John Costlow, guitars; Gerard Bowsher, drums; Brian Benison, bass, keyboards and director; Athena Meyer, flute, keyboard & vocals and David Lyles, Victor Meyer, Honey Rae, Aimee Pietzsch, Peggy Spears, Mark Trance & Kimberly Ward, vocals. Sound at the Spirit Games by Opie Odom.\nAsked about the 2012 Spirit Games, 5Choir director Brian said, \"I was thrilled when Jim Breen, President of The [Stephen Breen Memorial] Foundation called and asked if the 5Choir could play at the Spirit Games. Jim heard us play at the 5PM Mass at Saint Andrew and thought we were a good fit.

I first heard about Bank of America doing this yesterday, but now I’m learning that other banks like Chase and Wells Fargo may be doing it as well. Not that I’m surprised. A lot of national chain banks are starting to have fees for just about everything else you do.\nHere’s what the New York Times said on this:\nBank of America joins banks including SunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells Fargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up to record levels, a recent survey found.\nThe added fees have come even though the limit on the merchant fees wasn’t as low as banks initially had feared.

Which is why it was so surprising when the Canadian man received a letter addressed “To the Estate of George Johannesen.” Even more surprising is that it came from his insurance company, who should really be on top of such things.\nNow this wouldn’t have been so terrible if Manitoba Public Insurance was giving Johannesen’s estate a fat check for his passing away. But that’s not what happened. Instead the letter was to inform the estate that, since George was dead, his driver license and auto insurance had been cancelled in October.\nThis poses a problem for Johannesen because, being alive, he continues to drive his car.\n“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” he told the Toronto Sun. “For me to be declared dead, someone would have to present a death certificate. For someone to get that, I guess I must have died sometime in October.”\nNow the 59-year-old worries that he will stop getting his pension and other government benefits.

In this algorithm, the qualitative part of model integration is performed first, followed by the quantitative combination. We illustrate our method with an example of combining three models. We also identify the factors that may influence the complexity of the integrated model. Accordingly, we identify three factors that may influence the complexity of the integrated model.

A British couple who have spent the past 12 years working as Christian missionaries in the the Gambia have been jailed after being charged with sedition. (British missionaries jailed in Gambia )\nBanjul from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:000000f2.JPG\n3. Scary Tales of Tiny Gambia Being the Headquarters of the Mafia World\nBy Bubacarr Ceesay\nDecember 13, 2005\nThe Gambia is the international limelight again as the center of an international mafia ring.\nIn a masterpiece investigative report, The Wayne Madsen Report unraveled a network of weapons smugglers and mobsters operating in the heart of the Gambian Capital, working hand in hand with the Gambian leader, President Yahya Jammeh.\nIn reference to the Gambia, the report stated thus:\n\"There is also now interest in the activities of Richard T. Hines, the head of the powerful Republican lobbying firm RTH Consulting, Inc.\n\"Hines, a South Carolina native and a protege of the late GOP dirty trickmeister Lee Atwater, was one of the architects of the dirty tricks campaign by Bush against John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary.\n\"A confederate of Abramoff in the 1980s Reagan administration's covert support network for the Nicaraguan contras, Angolan UNITA guerrillas, and Afghan mujaheddin, Hines is active in various Confederacy resurgence organizations, many of which have clear racist agendas.\n\"However, that has not prevented Hines from becoming the lobbyist for Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh, a military officer who overthrew Gambia's democratically-elected President Sir Dawda K. Jawara in a 1994 military coup supported by the United States Navy.\n\"Hines inherited the lobbying contract for Gambia from the eclectic Washington lobbyist Edward von Kloberg III, an individual who represented Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Liberia's Samuel K. Doe, Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Congolese leader Laurent Kabila, the exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda, and Saddam Hussein.\n\"Last May, von Kloberg took a swan dive off of a castle in Rome, allegedly committing suicide after a spat with a gay partner.\n\"The connections between Hines and Gambia are important since the small narrow West African country is also a major base of operations for notorious Russian international arms smuggler Viktor Bout.\n\"The Gambia is the headquarters for one of many of Bout's front companies -- companies that are used to smuggle everything from weapons to diamonds and mercenaries to international relief supplies.\nBout, reportedly in a Bangkok jail since March 2008\n\"In fact, Bout was the character on whom fictional arms smuggler Yuri Orlov, played by Nicolas Cage in the movie Lord of War, was largely based.\n\"Bout's connections with the Christian Right do not end with Gambia.\n\"Bout was Liberian dictator Charles Taylor's primary arms and diamond smuggler.\n\"Bout and his associates were given Liberian diplomatic passports and, with Taylor's blessing and protection, they registered a number of their front companies in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.\n\"Taylor, who is now in exile in Nigeria, was a business partner with Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson.\n\"Robertson's organization mentored both Ralph Reed and Richard Hines.\n\"According to British and Israeli intelligence sources, Taylor also enabled Al Qaeda to launder blood diamonds for cash through Liberia.\n\"Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone were where Israeli mobsters engaged in business with Israeli gangsters who operated under the full protection of the Israeli Likud government.\n\"Before Likud began purging Mossad of experienced intelligence officers with ties to the Israeli Labor Party, the Israeli-Al Qaeda diamond financial connection in West Africa was being pointed out by those officers as suicidal for Israeli interests.\n\"However, Taylor and Bout had powerful interests in the United States: a combination of the Christian Right and pro-Likud organizations like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), both of which ignored and continue to ignore Israeli organized crime connections to Al Qaeda and terrorism.\n\"Robertson and Taylor were business partners in a Cayman Islands front company called Freedom Gold, Ltd.\n\"In fact, Freedom Gold bas headquartered at Robertson's CBN offices in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Robertson's African interests also crossed paths with Bout's in another country -- the former Zaire.\n\"Robertson's African Development Company used the cover of Robertson's tax-exempt \"Operation Blessing\" to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war-ravaged Zaire (now Congo).\n\"A UN Security Council report dated November 30, 2005, lists Bout's Gambia New Millennium Air Company as having its address at the residence of Hines' client Jammeh: State House, Banjul, Gambia.\n\"The UN report states, 'The Director of this firm is Baba Jobe, who is already listed on the Liberia Sanctions Committee's assets freeze list. According to a commercial aviation database, the firm acted as a cover for Victor Bout's operations. Its one aircraft, a Russian-made passenger jet, was acquired from Centrafrican Airlines.'\n\"It is noteworthy that Hines's client, President Jammeh, just took possession of the Russian-made VIP presidential passenger jet, an Ilyushin IL-62 (C5-GNM) [Gambia] (formerly CCCP-86511 [USSR], RA-86511 [Russia], 3D-RTI [Swaziland], TL-ACL [Central African Republic]).\n\"And also of interest is the owner of the presidential aircraft: it is none other than Gambia New Millennium Air, the Bout-owned company listed on the UN Security Council freeze list and which is headquartered at Jammeh's State House in Banjul, the Gambian capital.\n\"In fact, the plane had been previously registered to Bout front companies in Swaziland and the Central African Republic.\n\" Bout, who flew arms and passengers from Dubai and other locations to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan prior to 9-11, is now providing air services in post-Taliban Afghanistan as well as U.S.-occupied Iraq.\n\"Bout's transactions with the Taliban were handled by Vial, Inc., a firm based in Delaware.\n\"One of Bout's closest associates is the Russian-Israeli Odessa-born crime boss Leonid Minin, an Israeli national who, according to the UN Security Council, travels on forged German passports as well as legal Israeli, Russian, Greek, and Bolivian passports under at least ten aliases.\n\"It is also noteworthy that many of Bout's operations are based in Eastern European countries that have been mentioned in association with the rendition and transporting of CIA prisoners.\n\"Bout's numerous Russian-built cargo and passenger planes have been seen at the same airports used by CIA flights.\n\"For example, Bright Aviation, a suspected Bout front, is based at Sofia Airport in Bulgaria.\n\"Bulgaria is believed to be one of the countries used by the CIA to house secret prisoners.\n\"Another Bout front, Moldtransavia SRL, is based in Chisinau, Moldova, another suspected stopover point for CIA flights.\n\"One Chisinau, Moldova-based Bout front company, Aerocom, which also does business as Air Mero, is contracted to fly for Kellogg, Brown & Root in Iraq and elsewhere.\n\"Aerocom has also been cited in UN and DEA reports for being involved in drug smuggling in Belize.\n\"Some law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe believe that the covert flights being operated by CIA contractors and Bout's companies in support of secret prisoner movement are also involved in smuggling drugs.\n\"After being subjected to news reports, Aerocom quickly changed its name last year.\"\nHighly dependable sources in Banjul also informed AllGambian about recent arms purchase by the Jammeh regime from an undisclosed country, amounting to 4.3 million dalasis.\nThis comes at the heels of a hard-hitting border impasse between the Gambia and Senegal.\nThe stand-off almost paralyzed the Gambian economy and caused untold hardship on the average Gambian. Observers wondered how the Gambia gov can afford to spend on presidential jets and military hardware at this junction when the economy is in shambles.", "id": "<urn:uuid:052280ae-4e57-401f-95a0-23a58b01b11a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aangirfan.blogspot.ca/2008/12/gambia-and-organised-crime.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:19:30Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9478747844696045, "token_count": 1848, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Previous abstract Next abstract\nSession 40 - The Interstellar Medium.\nDisplay session, Tuesday, June 09\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) explosions can make kpc-size shells and holes in the interstellar media (ISM) of spiral galaxies if much of the energy heats the local gas to above 10^7 K. Disk blowout is probably the major cause for energy loss in this case, but the momentum acquired during the pressurized expansion phase can be large enough that the bubble still snowplows to a kpc diameter. This differs from the standard model for the origin of such shells by multiple supernovae, which may have problems with radiative cooling, evaporative losses, and disk blow-out. Evidence for giant shells with energies of \\sim10^53 ergs are summarized. Some contain no obvious central star clusters and may be GRB remnants, although sufficiently old clusters would be hard to detect. The expected frequency of GRBs in normal galaxies can account for the number of such shells.\nProgram listing for Tuesday", "id": "<urn:uuid:e2300ad5-01dd-4e80-92b3-7ec88785cc9d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aas.org/archives/BAAS/v30n2/aas192/abs/S040015.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:41Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9126408100128174, "token_count": 208, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Navigational", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Noise"]}

{"text": "Everyone wishes for something. And lots of people believe they know how to make their wishes come true with magical thinking.\nWhat is it? \"Magical thinking is a belief in forms of causation, with no known physical basis,\" said Professor Emily Pronin of Princeton. \"So, for example, there's no known physical basis for how carrying a fluffy pink rabbit's foot in your pocket is going to increase your odds of winning the lottery.\"\nFor magical thinkers, it's more about the power of their wishes, their feelings and their positive thinking to affect their lives directly.\nTwenty-seven-year-old aspiring actress Lindsay Lioz relies on magical thinking to further her showbiz career -- starting with visualizing every audition in advance. \"It makes me feel like I've had rehearsal,\" she said. \"It makes me feel prepared.\"\nLioz also uses magical thinking to improve her love life. She's written a list of the qualities she wants in a man -- and she sleeps with that list under her pillow every night. How has it worked so far? \"I have great men in my life, I do. I'm very happy with how it's working out.\"\nMagical thinkers call that idea \"the law of attraction.\" It's a key element of the bestselling book \"The Secret,\" which has been hailed by Oprah Winfrey and bought by millions worldwide.\n\"'The Secret' is telling people that if you think positive thoughts, positive things will happen, even at a very specific level,\" Pronin said. \"If you visualize getting a parking space, you will get one. If you want to get thin, just stop having fat thoughts.\"\nMagical thinking is not a religion. It's a different kind of faith -- a faith in the power of positive thoughts and feelings. Yet as unscientific as magical thinking sounds, Pronin said studies have shown there are times when it seems to have a real effect: \"There was a study where people in their mid-20s were measured in terms of their optimism,\" she said, \"and then, 50 years later, those who were more optimistic, were actually more likely to still be alive. So it's not always magical to believe that your positive thoughts are having a positive effect.\"\nMagical thinking starts in childhood. At the University of Texas, Professor Jacqui Woolley has examined how children who know the difference between what's real and what's not believe that wishing can cause a penny to appear in what has just been shown to be an empty box. \"We find that, by about the age of 4, most of the kids we test seem to really believe that wishing works,\" said Woolley. \"So that would be an example of magical thinking.\"\nNick Barber spent his childhood wishing for riches, focusing on something his father gave him. \"I was about 8 or 9 when my dad came home and gave me a fake million dollar bill,\" he said. \"And that became something that represented my goals. I've hung on to it every since.\"\nBarber would even sleep with the bill under his mattress. Now, at 27, he runs a multimillion dollar real estate company in Dallas called UMoveFree, and he still has that million dollar bill in his wallet. How did that bill help him get to this point? \"It allowed me to believe in myself at a very young age,\" Barber said, \"not to pay attention to those that said you can't, and to always believe that I can.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:97684525-19c7-48da-a302-c2da701993dd>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3160862&page=1", "date": "2013-05-18T07:15:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9900368452072144, "token_count": 716, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Do you drive a picop? Eat sándwiches de rosbif? Do you still own any cederrones? If these words don't sound familiar to you, that's because yesterday, the Associated Press released their first-ever Spanish language style guide, and set us all straight on the proper usage of some of Español's newest words.\nIn case there's any confusion, picop is AP's official Spanish-language word for what many call a camioneta or pick-up truck, rosbif is their official spelling for \"roast beef\" in Spanish. And cederrón? That means CD-ROM. Duh.\nGathered in the auditorium of the prestigious Columbia Journalism School, some of the leading Spanish-language journalists sat down on Monday evening to discuss the finer points of the \"language of Cervantes\" and the AP stylebook -- which they describe as the \"journalist's bible.\" Debate over the AP's continued use of term \"illegal immigrant\" dominated much of the event. But the most lively part of the evening was the presentation of words with roots in modern-day English -- or \"estadunidismos,\" as the new Stylebook calls them.\nIf the Spanish-language style guide is to be our bible, then Monday evening's Moses was surely Argentine journalist Jorge Ignacio Covarrubias who has worked with the AP for more than 40 years and helped put together the new stylebook. The white-haired Covarrubias handed down to us such words as zapeo for channel surfing, cibersitio for website, pipermín for peppermint, ofimática for computer system for office management (like Word), and vermú for vermouth -- all in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. (Can we please call it a Powerrpoín?)\nBut not all Spanglish words are fair game, according to Covarrubias. For example, the AP recommends against using parada to mean parade. The word \"parada\" has historically been used to mean \"stop\", but many modern-day Spanish speakers have started using it to also mean parade. The AP suggests that writers instead use \"desfile.\"\nMany regionalisms are also discouraged. Autobús is the preferred term for bus, although some countries use guagua and others say colectivo. But, after lengthy discussion of the Spanish word for \"drinking straw,\" (pajita vs. popote vs. canuto), no consensus has yet been reached, said Covarrubias.\nNot everybody was happy about all of the AP's decisions. Laura Martínez, a bilingual blogger who writes about Hispanic media, tweeted \"Cervantes is probably revolcándose en la tumba tras escuchar el tema ése del \"cederrón\",\" which translates to \"Cervantes is probably turning over in his grave after hearing the thing about the 'cederrón'\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:cd3169e8-c0b9-4e0a-9e29-ee6c8330ed11>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/ap-spanish-language-stylebook-introduces-technical-spanglish/story?id=17769035", "date": "2013-05-18T06:21:24Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9210053086280823, "token_count": 619, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Nine people in South Korea have committed suicide in three separate incidents within two days. The latest was a 72-year-old man who hanged himself at a construction site in Hoengseong, Kangwon Province, Thursday, police said.\nFour women and one man -- in their 20s and 30s -- were found dead Wednesday in Hwaseong, just south of Seoul, after sealing a passenger car with plastics sheets and inhaling toxic fumes from burned coal briquettes.\nThey left suicide notes saying, \"I have no more hope and no more dreams\" and \"please find my identification card in my back pocket.\"\nPolice were investigating their motive but assumed that the man recruited the four women on the Internet to participate in a group suicide.\nEarlier in another city east of Seoul, Chuncheon, three men in their 20s were also found dead at a private room-for-rent lodge using the same method and sealing the door and windows with dark masking tape from inside the room they were sharing.\nPolice assumed that they, too, were driven by group suicide pacts cultivated online.\nSuch news is common here where the suicide rate is the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of developed countries.\nAn average of 35.1 people killed themselves everyday in 2008, according to the health ministry. That's 24.3 for every 100,000 South Koreans, followed by 21 in Hungary, 19.4 in Japan, 16.7 in Finland and 15.8 in Belgium.\nThe National Statistics Office reported that the suicides are related to the economic downturn, as well as rapid social change within the family and the community.\nKorean society in recent years has been plagued by continuous cases of suicide among celebrities, high-profile politicians and businessmen, teenagers and the elderly. Analysts say the most common cause is depression stemming from social and academic pressures or family troubles.\n\"There's a huge gap in this country because the speed of materialism spreading is much faster than the speed of cultural maturity that must grow together. It all comes from stress of rapid modernization,\" said Jeung Taek-Hee, an expert and consultant at Lifeline Korea.\nKorean parents are having fewer children -- on average one per couple -- and more women are going into the workforce, which leaves the child alone. Although some corporations and government ministries are campaigning for workers to go home by 6 o'clock at least once a month to spend family time, Korean corporate culture still requires employees to participate in work-related dinners and stay late hours.\n\"Naturally, these busy parents end up spoiling the child who ends up self-centered and incapable of dealing with competition,\" Jeung said. \"But the reality is that this society is very, very competitive.\"\nAlong with the miraculous rate of economic growth in the past decades, many South Koreans have become driven by materialism that has been passed on to their kids, Jeung said.\nHe noted that most of the people who commit suicide, especially the young teenagers, find themselves dangerously distressed by not being able to keep up with others materialistically and eventually become anti-social.\n\"The easiest place where they can meet friends who share the same pain is online through suicide communities or chat sites,\" Jeung said.\nOnce they find each other, they become, \"eternal comrades\" who \"must accompany each other to death,\" he said.\nAccording to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, 28.4 percent of young teenagers committed suicide in 2008 because of \"disturbed family relations,\" mostly the result of parental divorce, 19.6 percent from pessimistic depression and 10.1 percent from academic pressure.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2edc9224-49dc-4ff8-a3a7-e5c117b470e6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-struck-online-suicide-pacts/story?id=10636608", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:24Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9732953906059265, "token_count": 750, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "World leaders from 47 nations convene this week in Washington, D.C., for the Nuclear Security Summit, a gathering that the Obama administration hopes will raise awareness about the threats of nuclear arms getting into the hands of terrorists or \"rogue\" nations.\nPresident Obama said Sunday the goal of the nuclear summit is to discuss the terrorist threat and getting countries to lock down their nuclear weapons in a specific time frame. The Obama administration itself has pledged to try to \"secure all vulnerable materials\" within four years and is hoping the summit will spark a case for preventive action among others.\n\"If there was ever a detonation in New York City or London or Johannesburg, the ramifications economically, politically, and from a security perspective would be devastating,\" Obama said on the eve of the summit. \"And we know that organizations like al Qaeda are in the process of trying to secure a nuclear weapon -- a weapon of mass destruction that they have no compunction of using.\"\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week that the nuclear summit would be the largest of its kind hosted by a U.S. president since the U.N. conference in 1945.\nBut even as Obama brings the issue of nuclear security and disarmament into the spotlight -- first with the release of the new U.S. nuclear policy, and then the U.S.-Russia arms reduction agreement -- he faces significant challenges from two fronts.\nInternationally, U.S. allies such as India, Pakistan and Israel have been resistant to signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, citing national security concerns. The view in many countries is that this week's treaty signing aside, if the United States and Russia -- which together account for 95 percent of the world's nuclear arsenal and material -- cannot cut their nuclear stockpile, why should they be forced to?\n\"No one is willing to step up and say, 'Yea, I'm part of the problem here,\" said former national security official Ivan Oelrich, now vice president of the Strategic Security Program at the Federation of American Scientists. The \"U.S. and Russia have to lead the way in major reductions.\"\nParticipant countries will also likely be looking to the United States for accountability. Henry Sokolsi, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, argues that if the United States is going to try to persuade other countries, it needs to shift its own policy at home too.\n\"I just think it's disrespectful to these countries,\" he said. \"Each country has its own problems. If we're not helping them on that, how can we expect them to not rely on them [nuclear weapons] to feel secure? We rely on them. Why should they be any different?\"\nDomestically, the partisan rift on Capitol Hill means possibly a tough fight ahead for Obama's nuclear agenda. Critics of the new nuclear policy released last week complain that it gives a free pass to countries such as Iran and North Korea, and Republican senators are already taking aim at the U.S.-Russia arms treaty that was signed last week, saying it hurts U.S. security interests.\nThe general consensus is that the treaty will eventually be ratified by the end of the year, but the issue is likely to be the subject of a heated political debate for much longer.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0a9b45ec-f8f1-41fa-82b8-42fdadb3c33f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-nuclear-security-summit-symbolic-gesture/story?id=10335607", "date": "2013-05-18T05:50:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9573078751564026, "token_count": 671, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Six days after boarding the \"Good Morning America\" Whistle-Stop '08 Tour train, and beginning the adventure of a lifetime, it's over.\nWe just wrapped the last show of our little Odyssey from the Newseum in the nation's capitol, Washington D.C., and for me, it was an appropriate but bittersweet ending to our tale.\nAppropriate because the point of our tour was to go out and ask real people what was on their minds, to hear straight from them their concerns about our nation.

{"text": "Recently I've been taking a deep dive into the Reactive Extensions for .NET. This is a wonderful project that comes out of Cloud Programmability Division at Microsoft. Rx helps do to really wonderful things with asynchronous and parallel programming in unreliable distributed world. Do you remember what LINQ did to the collections (and much more)? Well, Rx is going to do (and doing) the same to events, asynchronous and distributed programming.\nSo if you have to deal anything that requires more than a single thread, process or machine to run - you'll be impacted in some way or the other.\nThe thing I love the most about what Eric Meijer and his team are doing - the underlying logic which is simple plain and so beautiful. Even the entire IObservable/IObserver thing could be logically derived from IEnumerable by inverting the concepts logically.\nJust watch these videos, if you are interested in the details here (highly recommended):\nWhat does this have to do with CQRS, Domain-Driven Design and Event Sourcing?\nWhen I'm building some complex interactions and systems, I'm trying to follow the same principle. System design and evolution are not guided by the intuition or creativity. Pure logic and mathematical reason are the most reliable advisors here (it feels like proving a theorem). It's really hard to explain in words, but logically solid design can handle a lot of things with really little effort (and code) just because of it's nature. Basically it allows to say to new challenges: \"we did not code for this, but since this is logical, it already is in the design, you just need to enable this\".\nWhile I'm just learning CQRS/DDD/ES I want to do it in the logical way that will prevent me from doing bad and illogical things (which will impact my systems later in their lifecycle). Way of thinking that Eric Meijer shows, seems to help here. Besides, it helps to merge the ideas of Pat Helland (almost infinitely scalable systems) into the overall CQRS concepts.\nReactive Extensions benefit a lot from the marble diagrams representing parallel processes and their interactions. So I've tried to re-apply these principles to my understanding of CQRS/DDD/ES. By mechanically reflecting the logic, here's what I've got for the command handler:\nEssentially this picture reflects the flow of commands (marked with D for Do) incoming into the handler. Commands can come as a single or as a batch (that's the marble or tick in this reality). Commands coming together either succeed or fail together.\nEach incoming tick translates into a new parallel reality for an aggregate (just like SelectMany in Rx, where you get observable of observable of T). Then we flatten successful commands onto the change stream (each change is a unit of work), while errors are flattened into the failure stream.\nThere is a message dispatcher that catches up upon these streams and sends domain events, command failures and confirmations back to the message bus. This way subscribers will have logically complete information about what's happened in the business logic. Subscribers could include sagas and event handlers working with read models (which will be used to provide clients with feedback that includes potential command failures).\nNote a few differences upon the traditional CQRS with event sourcing approach as advocated by Greg Young:\n- Aggregate Root can react to incoming commands by providing a finite stream of events, optionally terminating with error (there is a direct translation from Rx observers here: OnError and OnComplete).\n- We save successful change (command(s) and resulting events) atomically as unit of work. Persisting commands will actually let us ensure command idempotency in the cruel world of scalable message queues (with \"at least once\" deliveries). Essentially this is reflection of Helland's activities that we need to have in the same scope with the aggregates that own them.\n- Command failures are also saved (although the stream could be different from the event source). We don't need to save the intermediate events though - just command(s) and the resulting failure.\n- Message dispatcher runs upon the failure and change streams, publishing domain events into the message bus. We have logically complete information here, that could eventually be provided for the client (sender) for the retrieval.\n- theoretically we can easily process commands for a single aggregate in multiple threads, serializing access to the change and failure streams.\nThings that do not fit in, yet:\n- In CQRS practice there are cases, when there would traditionally be a call to the domain service (in the command handler and before the aggregate root). This does not fit in here. In a Rx world this would probably be a separate async command handler. Yet this would require an additional layer of translation (another command handler and event handler).\n- events and commands are some sort of duals. They are both messages that bring along different intent and help to organize CQRS architecture (this comes from the DDD realm). Yet, this duality (and the rules coming out of it) brings additional complexity, when you need to chain multiple operations (first call unreliable operation, then pass the result to the aggregate, then do something else). I think I'm missing some aspect of commands and events that would help to lay out interactions in a clean and logical way.\nThat's a theory and logic as I see them today. This means:\n- tomorrow perception might evolve into something different that better brings together known patterns and constraints.\n- in theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice - there is a difference.\nIf I could bring in sagas, view event handlers and domain services into the picture in a logical way (and without breaking any existing scalability and consistency constraints), I'd be a happy man.\nWe'll see how it goes (see xLim 4: CQRS in Cloud series for any latest materials on this topic).

{"text": "UK Takeover Code Amendments Come into Effect, Contributed by Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP\nBy Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP\nThe Code Committee of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers has been consulting on proposed changes to the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (City Code) for just over a year. The consultation and resultant changes largely arose following the outcry after Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury and particularly the subsequent closure of Cadbury’s Somerdale factory near Bristol, despite pledges in the offer document to keep the plant open. Originally, the consultation considered far-reaching ideas such as giving different voting rights to long-term and short-term shareholders and increasing the level of ownership required to control a company beyond the traditional 50 percent level.\nAlthough a number of the more radical possibilities were rejected by the Code Committee earlier in the year, the proposed changes, which were initially unveiled in March 20111 and have now been published in final form,2 make a number of changes to the City Code which will affect the way in which takeover offers are effected. The changes are effective from 19 September 2011.\nAs expected, and despite some last minute lobbying, the final amendments largely reflect the Code Committee’s previous conclusions and the draft proposals published earlier this year.\nThe main themes of the changes are:\n- Shifting the balance of power from offerors to target companies;\n- Ending break fees, exclusivity and other deal-protection arrangements;\n- Increasing transparency on advisers’ fees;\n- Holding offerors to account for their statements of intention; and\n- Increasing employee involvement and information in offer processes.\nChanges to the Takeover Code\n— “Virtual Bid” Periods\nThe default requirement in all takeover situations will be that potential offerors must be publicly named and then have a fixed 28-day period to either make their offer or withdraw from the process entirely. The 28-day period may only be extended on the joint application of the offeror and offeree to the Panel. This switches the onus away from the offeree board having to approach the Panel for a “put up or shut up” deadline, in the event an offeror is laying siege to a target for a prolonged period of time without being identified.\nThis new requirement to identify a potential offeror will only apply when an announcement of a potential offer is required, and as a result, potential offerors will be further encouraged to protect the confidentiality of the process for a longer period of time. Potential offerors will not, however, be able to restrict (or attempt to restrict) the offeree from disclosing their identity where there City Code requires that disclosure.\nThe Panel is expected to be receptive to requests to extend the 28-day period, particularly where good reasons can be shown why the process is taking longer. Friendly, recommended offers should therefore be able to proceed on a slightly slower timetable while hostile or unwelcome offerors will be forced to move with much more decisiveness.\nThere is a limited exception from the proposed identification regime and time limits where an offeree announces that it is conducting a formal sale process and seeking one or more potential offerors. The details of the sale process and proposed participants will not then need to be made public. In order to qualify for this exemption, the offeree will need to formally put itself up for sale; traditional “strategic review” announcements, often seen as code for putting themselves up for sale, will not be sufficient.\n— Deal Protection Measures\nDeal protection measures will be completely prohibited except in very limited circumstances. The restriction will apply to “offer-related arrangements,” which are generally defined as “any agreement, arrangement or commitment in connection with an offer” and will apply to currently common arrangements such as:\n- Inducement fee and break fee arrangements;\n- Implementation agreements;\n- Exclusivity arrangements; and\n- “Work-fee” arrangements.\nInducement fees will still be permitted in exceptional circumstances such as where a “white knight” offeror3 makes an offer following the announcement of a hostile offer. The inducement fee will, however, be of limited value as it will only apply if a third competing offeror were to materialise and succeed, not if the original hostile offeror were to succeed.\nAs anticipated, the City Code itself will now contain specific provisions regarding takeovers which are implemented by way of schemes of arrangement to ensure that offeree companies adhere to any timetable and process agreed with the offeror and included in the offer documentation.\n— Disclosure of Fees\nThe estimated fees payable by offerors and offerees will need to be disclosed in offer documents. These will be broken down by category of adviser, with the fee for each of the offeror and offeree and in respect of the offeror’s financing arrangements being split out separately.\nThe new rules address different fee structures, such as success fees, by providing the ability to disclose expected fees and maximum fees so as to protect commercially sensitive information, such as the thresholds at which success fees may kick in. Where the disclosure subsequently proves inadequate, updated information may need to be publicly announced.\n— Increased Disclosure Requirements\nIncreased disclosure about the financing of offers will be required, with copies of the financing documents to be made available on the offeror’s website. Certain commercially sensitive information, such as headroom to increase an offer, may be withheld, as may the structure by which equity is provided to private equity offeror vehicles; a general disclosure as to how much is sourced from each fund will be sufficient.\nSeparately, all-cash offerors need to disclose additional information, putting them on par with offerors offering securities as consideration, though this will not extend to information such as a pro forma balance sheet reflecting the offer and significant change statements since their last audited accounts.\n— Statements as to Future Conduct\nFollowing the public and political criticism following Kraft’s closure of Cadbury’s Somerdale factory, the City Code is being strengthened to try to force more and better disclosure.\nOfferors will be required to include enhanced statements of their intentions for the offeree business and its employees as well as information about the effect of the offer on its own business. They will then be expected to hold to those statements for either any period specified in the statement or, in the absence of any statement, at least 12 months following the offer becoming unconditional. Offerors will only be released from these statements if there has been a material change in circumstances.\nIn order to counter the risk that the new rule will encourage vague and general statements, the Code Committee has stated that an offeror should disclose as fully as possible its commercial rationale for the takeover and that general statements are unlikely to be acceptable where an offeror has had an opportunity to undertake full due diligence.\n— Employee Involvement\nEmployees and employee representatives will have enhanced rights to comment on the effects on employment of a proposed offer and to have their costs in obtaining advice to verify the information contained in their opinion paid for by the offeree company.\nThe Code Committee has stated its view that the costs should be limited to those required to verify the statement by reference to existing sources and not to the provision of general advice as to the opinion or to the commissioning of new research to substantiate an opinion. However, it is likely that there will be debates in the future over the extent of the costs which will be covered, particularly in takeover situations which attract employee and trade union opposition.\nIn addition, offeree companies will be required to publish the opinion of the employees or employee representatives on their websites (and announce having done so) when the opinion is received too late to be included in the offer documentation. Under the old rules, there was no provision requiring this opinion to be published if it was not received in sufficient time to be included within the offer documents.\n— “Virtual Bid” Periods\nWhere an offeree is in an offer period on the implementation date and if it was in talks with or had received an approach from an offeror at the beginning of the offer period, the identity of the potential offeror will need to be announced by 5 p.m. on the implementation date.\nSeparately, any potential offeror identified in an announcement made on or before the implementation date must, by not later than 5 p.m. on the 28th day after the implementation date, either:\n- Announce a firm intention to make an offer;\n- Announce it does not intend to make an offer; or\n- Together with the offeree company, obtain Panel consent to an extension of the deadline.\n— Deal Protection Measures\nInducement fees or other offer-related arrangements entered into before the implementation date will not be subject to the new prohibition.\n— Offer Documents & Offeree Board Circulars\nWhere the offeror publishes the initial offer document before the implementation date, all subsequent offer-related documents must comply with the City Code’s provisions as they were before the implementation date, irrespective of when those documents are published.\n— Employee Involvement\nOfferee companies will be required to publish employee representatives’ opinions on a website and announce having done so with effect from the implementation date, even if the offer document to which the employee representatives’ opinion relates was published before the implementation date.\nDespite the extensive nature of these changes, the Code Committee has already flagged future areas of amendment, such as imposing an ongoing obligation to update material information as it changes, and not only when the next offer-related document is published.\nAlasdair Steele is a corporate partner at Nabarro LLP, specialising in UK and cross-border corporate finance, including public and private M&A, strategic investments and primary and secondary equity issues, as well as regularly advising on consortia and corporate joint venture arrangements, particularly in the infrastructure sector.

{"text": "|HOME SCHEDULE AUTHOR INDEX SUBJECT INDEX|\nPartitioning of carbon, water, and energy fluxes between understory and canopy in a North Central Florida mature uneven aged pine flatwoods forest.\nStarr, Gregory*,1, Powell, Thomas1, Martin, Timothy1, Gholz, Henry1,2, 1 School of Forestry Resources and Conservation, Gainesville, FL2 National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA\nABSTRACT- Of the 5.93 million ha of timberland within the state of Florida, only 19% are maintained under conditions classified as \"natural\" pine forest. While considerable attention has been focused on the carbon and water dynamics of managed pine plantations in the region, little attention has been given to these natural forests, which are an integral part of the complex mosaic of lands in the region. Based on this importance, it was our intention to quantify how environmental conditions affect ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchange within a mature pine flatwoods forest and determine how specific components of the system, (i.e. leaf physiology, soil respiration, understory composition and canopy structure), contribute to these exchange rates. During the 2000-2001 field season, the natural pine flatwoods was a carbon sink with an annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of 183 g C m-2. The largest portion of this carbon was sequestered during the winter and spring when temperatures were cooler and canopy LAI was lowest. This could be attributed to a reduction in ecosystem respiration losses and a slight increase in understory photosynthetic rates caused by a larger portion of total radiation reaching the understory. Approximately 90% of the respiratory losses from the system could be accounted through soil respiration, which is highly correlated to soil water potential (r2=0.77, p<0.001). Comparison of eddy covariance measurements above and below the pine canopy indicated that 37% of the ecosystemís carbon, 51 % of its latent energy, and 56% of its sensible heat fluxes could be attributed to the understory. Preliminary results show that two species, Serenoa repens and Ilex glabra, comprise 95% of the understory vascular and both have relatively high leaf nitrogen concentration and photosynthetic capacities (~1.4% nitrogen and Amax ~ 4.0 mmol m-2 s-1) and account for ~ 90% of the carbon sequestered by the understory community. These initial assessments provide evidence that natural pine flatwood forest of Florida may be a small regional carbon sink.\nKEY WORDS: pine flatwoods, carbon and water exchange, eddy covariance", "id": "<urn:uuid:09d8a50e-b5b5-4ac8-9b83-20535564e5da>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abstracts.co.allenpress.com/pweb/esa2002/document/17486", "date": "2013-05-18T05:53:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9265906810760498, "token_count": 537, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Navigational", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean"]}

That's what was used in the original Rivers' EGDT study.\nI've never even seen one before.\nMany emergency physicians are getting around not having the specialized equipment issue by obtaining intermittent venous blood gas measurements off of a central venous line.\nBut what if you had a 30 y/o woman with early pyelonephritis/urosepsis who has severe sepsis by definition? She's got 10 peripheral lines (I'm exaggerating, of course), a normalized blood pressure with early IV fluids, and appears non-toxic. Her lactate, however, is 9! Do you really need a central line? My gut says no, but the EGDT protocol says yes -- for the purpose of CVP and ScvO2 measurements.\nTrick of the Trade:\nUse a less-invasive approach where bedside ultrasound and serial venous lactate levels replace central venous lines and ScvO2 measurements, respectively.\nLast year, JAMA published a landmark study showing that lactate clearance of ≥10% over the first 2 hours is \"not a worse measurement\" than ScvO2≥70%. This double-negative statistical speak came about because it was a non-inferiority study.\nSo how does this affect the original Rivers protocol? To review, here's the original protocol, which I posted about earlier:\n(click to view larger image)\nIn the less invasive model:\nFluid resuscitate through peripheral IV access instead of a central line.\nFollow volume status either with a bedside ultrasound or urine output.\nFollow venous lactate levels at time 0 and 2 hours. If the lactate clearance is ≥10% over these 2 hours, you should follow the algorithm as if the ScvO2≥70%. That means no need for immediate transfusion or vasopressor agents.\nHow do you know when you have adequately volume-resuscitated a patient using bedside ultrasound? Measure the IVC diameter about 1-2 cm from the right atrium junction.\nIf the IVC diameter ≤1.5 cm and has ≥50% collapse with inspiration, the patient has a very low CVP.\nIf the IVC diameter is at least 1.5 cm and has minimal collapse with inspiration, the patient is euvolemic. Move to the next step -- assessing the MAP.\nThis doesn't mean that all EGDT patient should have ONLY peripheral lines. Persistent hypotension, a non-clearing lactate level, and/or clinical toxicity warrant more invasive monitoring and management.\nScott Weingart has an in-depth, 21-minute podcast about the JAMA article and noninvasive approach to sepsis: Podcast link. Scott also briefly interviews Dr. Alan Jones (Carolinas Medical Center), the first author of the study, in the podcast.\nReference Jones AE, et al; Emergency Medicine Shock Research Network (EMShockNet) Investigators.

There is a great summary table of the generational differences in personal, work, and educational characteristics, communication styles, and technology.\nThink of faculty who fit in these age groups. Do they fit their generational stereotype?\nTraditionalists (born 1925-1945)\nPersonal characteristics: Loyal, reluctant to change, dedicated, value honor and duty, patriotic\nWork characteristics: Value hierarchy, loyal \"company man\", job security\nEducation characteristics: Process oriented\nCommunication style: Formal\nTechnology: Tend not to understand\nBaby Boomers(born 1945-1964)\nPersonal characteristics: Optimistic, desire for personal gratification, highly competitive\nWork characteristics: Workaholic, competitive, consensus builder, mentor\nEducation characteristics: Learner depends on educator, lecture format, process-oriented\nCommunication style: Diplomatic\nTechnology: Not particularly techno-saavy\nGeneration Xers (born 1964-1980)\nPersonal characteristics: Independent, self-directed, skeptical, resilient, more accepting of diversity, self-reliant\nWork characteristics: Value work-life balance, comfortable with change, question authority\nEducation characteristics: Independent learners, problem-solvers, desire to learn on the job, outcome-oriented\nCommunication style: Blunt\nTechnology: Interested and facile\nMillennials (born 1980-1999)\nPersonal characteristics: Optimistic, need for praise, collaborative, global outlook\nWork characteristics: Team-oriented, follows rules and likes having structured time, career changes\nEducation characteristics: Team-based learning environment, turn to Internet for answers, outcome-oriented\nCommunication style: Polite\nTechnology: Very saavy, technology is a necessity\nThe authors give multiple examples where generational differences come to light but none more so than in mentorship within the academic department.\nTraditionalists view mentorship as a more formal process, where feedback is necessary only to provide criticism or suggestions for improvement.\nBaby boomers also view mentorship as a \"top down\" process. They are ok with infrequent interactions.\nGeneration Xers and Millennialsprefer mentorship as a more \"peer to peer\" process with more frequent interactions. They value the personal relationships and the opportunity to collaborate in creative solutions. Because of their stereotypical distrust of authority, however, they may inadvertently sabotage their relationship with their mentors. Distrust sometimes is misinterpreted as a general lack of respect.\nTo overcome these differences, mentor-mentee pairings should take into consideration gender and shared views about goals, work/life balance, and experiences. Early discussions in a mentorship relationship should discuss generational differences and how each envisions the ideal mentor-mentee relationship to be. The pair should agree upon and adopt a collaborative, shared communication approach with frequent feedback.\nSo much more in this article... Take a read.\nMohr NM, Moreno-Walton L, Mills AM, et al.

In order to master this new skill, he had to actively struggle with it until he succeeded.

{"text": "It’s probably the height of arrogance for me to write a post about how one should taste whiskey. There are loads of people out there who have already covered this base, and they are far more knowledgeable on the subject. For me, whiskey is first and foremost about stories and anecdotes. The tasting of the alcohol is simply the fuel that allows the stories to flow more freely (oo.. how poetic! I’ll have to remember that bit).\nBut, for the sake of those out there who have never thought about “tasting” whiskey, it’s good to put this information out there. And since I will be posting various tastings on this here site, it’s a good idea to give you all the process I will be using.\nFirst and foremost, let’s get one thing out of the way. There’s a huge chasm between the idea of tasting whiskey and the idea of enjoying whiskey. One activity does not necessarily have to include the other. If you enjoy making cocktails out of the various whiskeys available on the market, then have at it. But it’s impossible to get a clear taste of whiskey once you adulterate it with bitters, ginger ale, or sour mix.\nAdditionally, tasting a whiskey involves more than simply putting it into your mouth and swallowing. It’s an encompassing experience, using the same amount of our senses as we use when consuming any other food or drink. So let’s define tasting as the act of learning the characteristics of the flavor of whiskey through the use of the senses. But which senses? The same ones used for tasting wine and judging food – seeing, smelling, and tasting.\nThe eyes gives us insight into the drink. It can tell us how young it is, or the kind of barrel in which it was aged. Generally speaking, the lighter the whiskey, the younger it will be. Whiskey straight from the still is often white, while there are some whiskeys out there that have been aged so long than they have a deep red to them. Bourbon gets it amber red color from the new and freshly charred oak barrels used in its aging process. If bourbon did not use new barrels, or if they didn’t char the new barrels they did use, the Kentucky spirit would have a completely different color.\nFinding the nose of the whiskey is even more important than the look of it. Some would say that the aromas of the whiskey is more important than the taste. From my reading, I’ve found that it’s not uncommon for blenders to base their recipes primarily on aromas. But if you’re not a blender, the nose is of secondary importance, behind taste.\nTo release the aromas of whiskey, a little water may be necessary. The best way to think of this is that a bit of water wakes up the whiskey that has been asleep from anywhere from 3 to 25 years. But how much water? According to Michael Jackson, you want to add just enough water dilute to around 30% alcohol by volume. Roughly speaking, this translates to a .5 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if your drinking 80 proof whiskey, or a 1 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if you’ve found yourself a whiskey that’s 100 proof. This is simply a rule of thumb, and one should expect many exceptions to this, especially in the older whiskeys.\nA quick side note – ice should be avoided, as well as chilled water, as they close down the aromatics of the whiskey. The water added should lack any obvious characteristics of its own. For example, you wouldn’t add mineral water to your whiskey. It is said that the best water to add to the whiskey is the water found at the site where the whiskey was distilled. Since I’ll assume that the vast majority of you out there are not millionaires, and cannot fly off to Kentucky or Speyside simply for a drink of whiskey, let’s just stick to bland water.\nSo what are you looking for when you smell a whiskey? That I’ll leave up to you to decide. From my point of view, there are no wrong answers to this question, because tasting is a very personal experience. If you place your snoot in a dram and the aromas remind you of Newark, then by god, that’s what you experienced. Yes, there is a vocabulary used by professional tasters, and usually they are simply variations of more broad terms (woody, fruitful, medicine, smoky, citrus-like). The aromas you find will likely trigger some sort of sense memory. The skill of a professional taster is to put a very specific and accurate word to describe their own sense memory. Or to put it another way, an amateur taster may say that a drink smells a bit fruity and a bit woody. A good taster will say that a whiskey carries a strong oak smell with an undercurrent of raisins. A great taster will say that the whiskey had been in two different casks, one that used in bourbon and the more recent one used in the making of sherry; additionally, there are hints of currants and peaches, as well as a little bit of vanilla.\nAll of these answers are right. The reason the last taster was able to put more words to the aromas was because they do this activity more often.\nThat’s the end of part 1. Tomorrow, I’ll post about whiskey glasses, and what to do once you actually put the whiskey in your mouth. And, as always, feel free to correct any of my mistakes by addressing them in the comments of this post.", "id": "<urn:uuid:574a5d4e-cf33-4332-b205-9d281ca214eb>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://accidentalhedonist.com/how-to-taste-whiskey-pt-1/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9597218632698059, "token_count": 1182, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Well, these are still some\ndifficult questions to answer with pin-point accuracy, and at this point I don't\nbelieve anyone has the exact answer to all 3 of these questions. What I offer\nbelow is a mix of what I Think, What I know and what Appears to be....\nAnyone currently attempting to\nanswer these questions with some type of \"Universal Knowledge\" on the\nsubject--is Full of BS--BEWARE! Yes, that includes Me. I don't have the\nComplete answer to these questions--and neither does anyone else. This is\na subject that needs to be studied in-depth by someone that has all the\nresources to carry it out: Lab, veterinary knowledge/skills, Acrochordus snakes,\nWhat is it:\nAt this point--I don't know, but here\nis what I believe based on experience, observation and research: The skin of the\nAcrochordus javanicus and arafurae is very impermeable. So, that makes it a very\nprotective mechanism against the outside world. It is commonly understood that\n\"Stress\" causes a reduction in the ability of the immune system to do its\njob--in humans and other animals--including Acrochordus snakes. Stress appears\nto cause a decline in the immune system of Acrochordus snakes causing a decline\nin the effectiveness of the skin as a protective barrier against the outside\nworld. This loss of effectiveness increases until Secondary Infections set in and\nultimately kill the animal.\nWhere does it come from:\nSee the paragraph above and add:\nImproper Husbandry. Yes, it really is that simple. In the Wild, these animals\nhave the ability to move from Habitat to Habitat--Microenvironment to\nMicroenvironment. Even though the White Spot Fungus appears to be a \"Captivity\"\nProblem--the snakes in the Wild maybe be able to prevent it--not by some\n\"Magical Bacteria\", but, rather: by simply selecting\nEnvironments/Microenvironments that they are \"Happy\" with--i.e., minimum\nsustained stress level. In Captivity--the snakes don't have that choice. Plain\nand Simple. Additionally, it appears that the more acclimated to captivity that\nthese snakes get--the more secretive and stress prone they become.\nHow do We get rid of it:\nProper Husbandry--Yes, it really is\nthat simple. Reduction of \"Stress\" will reduce the Progression of the White Spot\nFungus. I have seen it myself. Elimination of Stress will Halt the progression\nof White Spot Fungus. Note: I did not say anything about chemicals, medications,\netc.--just eliminate the Stress and the progression of the White Spot will stop.\nWhat is there will remain until the next shed. After the next shed--the animal\nwill be clean and remain that way--as long as all of the husbandry parameters\nare and remain in order. Its just that Simple. A new animal going through the\nacclimation process may need to shed 2, 3 or even 4 times before the White Spot\nrelents completely. However, its progress should be visibly reduced with each\nSo, what is \"Proper\nHusbandry\"? Well, that's what this website is about. No, I don't have all the\nanswers right now, but I've come a long way in the last couple of yrs dedicated\nto these snakes.\n1) If You are genuinely\ninterested in these snakes--then read this website: Every page, every word, look\nat every picture. This website is not setup for those who are just mildly\ncurious at best. Those folks are more then welcome here. But a lot of\ninformation is \"Hidden\" within the text for those who are serious about these\nanimals. Nothing is truly \"Hidden\", but even this explanation is not sitting on\nthe Front Page for the \"Scanners\" to see.\n2) Spend the hours necessary\nresearching these animals for Yourself. Right now, the more people that reach\nthe same conclusions--based upon knowledge and experience--the Better. The\nOnline Bibliography at the\nlink is a Good place to start.\n3) Acidic water (pH~6.0), Low\nTDSs (~200ppm), Low light--especially in the hide, Lack of vibrations, etc are\nGood key elements to the reduction of Stress and the furtherance of \"Proper\nRecently (4/2007) I have seen\na couple of \"For Sale\" ads for Acrochordus javanicus for one vendor that are\nwrought with misinformation--therefore: Misguidance on the keeping of these\nsnakes. One ad was for CB Babies basically stating to put them in acidic water\nand because they are CB and White Spot free--You (the buyer) don't need to worry\nabout any future \"Bacterial Infections\". Sorry, it just doesn't work that way.\nThe current ad states:\n\"I have adult specimens of Acrochordus javanicus, about 4' in\nlength. Perfect specimens with no scrapes, scar, and most importantly NO SKIN\nBLISTERS! As many people know WC adult Acrochordus javanicus are very rarely\noffered for sale, primarily because of the high mortality rates due to improper\npackaging during transport which causes skin blisters (Pseudomonas bacteria\nwhich cause septicemia, aka \"Blood Poisoning\").\nYou won't have to worry about that here. These adults came in perfectly and\nthere were transported correctly. I am only able to offer unsexed specimens.\nThis species is usually female heavy. There are many reports of this species\nbeing able to be parthogenetic, with LTC females \"cloning\" themselves. A great\ndisplay snake, they feed on fish. As with all Acrochordids, I reccomend great\nfiltration and the regular addition of a product called \"koi zyme.\"\nI am asking $250.00 per a specimen, quanities are limitied. Once\nthese are gone I will be a few more years until such nice large animals come\nInformation. Improper packaging/shipping is only one factor and most importantly:\n\"You won't have to worry about that here.\" That's Pure\nNon-Sense. I am familiar with\nthis particular individual. He claims to have \"...many years of Experience with\nAquatic Snakes.\" and apparently did a stint at a local zoo which I guess makes\nhim a Guru in his own mind. His website is and has remained void of his Great\nclaims of \"accomplishments\" (suddenly that's changing 6/07 LoL) and has been up for a few yrs now. Buy the\nsnakes--just don't buy into the BS claims. Apparently this person thinks that\nyou just need to buy the \"Clean\" animal from him, toss it into \"acidic water\"\nvia peat moss, add Koizyme and Wha-La: Instant Acrochordus! Again, Sorry, it\ndoesn't work that way. If it were that simple: Someone would have\nfigured it out a Looong time ago. I have used Salt, Koizyme, Melafix and\nPimafix. I have also researched those products and contacted the manufactures\nwith any specific questions that I had. One thing that I can tell you is:\nNone. Not One of those products are necessary to successfully\nkeep an Acrochordus javanicus or arafurae, Or halt the White Spot Fungus. More\nimportantly, in reference to the Ads,--Just because You receive a clean\nanimal--doesn't mean that it is going to stay that way. That whole\nthought process is coming from a Total lack of Experience. If that\nwere True--Plenty of people would be successfully keeping\nJavanicus. Am I being\nHardcore: Maybe. But I don't think that I am. I am tired of seeing these snakes\ndie--that's why I am working with them with the dedication that I am. That's why\nI put up this website--including all of the hours and hours of putting it\ntogether and the added expense. That's why I am willing to Openly call these\nso-called \"Gurus\" out here--and on the Forums. Sadly, they don't go\n\"heads-up\" with me in public any more. They just continue to hold onto their\nerroneous beliefs and pass along their Bad Information. These\nanimals will always go to the skin trade. But let's get it together and get them\nestablished in captivity, so they will always be around, and so people will be\nable to experience and enjoy their unique presence. I'm no rocket scientist, but\nI am a guy that can do research and think my way through most problems. If\nAcrochordus husbandry was as simple as some make it sound: This website would\nnot be here. And You can tell from reading this website that A) its not that\nsimple, and B) its a lot more involved than the \"Gurus\" want You to believe. I\nhave come across a number of individuals that all claim that they have kept\nAcrochordus snakes long-term. Notice: the Past tense of: HAVE!\nStrangely, None of them happen to be \"Currently\" keeping\nthem. Always--Past Tense! Hmmm, I'll leave You to Your Own\nConclusions on that one. Just Beware of the \"Claims\" out there.\nFollow the path that You feel is Best--but base it upon Research and,\nWhite Spot Fungus? Its caused\nby Stress and, basically, it appears to be a break-down in the skins ability to\nprotect the animal from the Outside World, eventually leading to Secondary\nInfections that lead to the demise of the snake. There is No \"Magical\" Bacteria\nthat Your snake was or was not exposed to in the wild--these snakes die in captivity\nfrom White spot all over the world--including captivity in Asia that contains\nwater from their own natural environments. Improper Shipping is not the sole\nsource of White Spot, Skin Blister, Whatever. Animals that Arrive in Your hands\n\"Clean\" Will develop White Spot if Housed Improperly and\nWill die from it if the Husbandry Parameters are not Corrected.\nWild-caught, Captive Born, Captive Bred and Born--doesn't matter. Tolerance is\nthe only difference between these animals--Environmental Imprints on their\nbrain. Captive Bred and Born babies are always at least a bit easier then\nCaptive Born babies. Captive Born babies are always a bit easier than\nWild-Caught babies. Wild-Caught babies are always easier then Wild-Caught\nadults. Acrochordus snakes are no different.\nIf You see White Spot fungus\non Your animal--the First question is: Is it Progressing? If it is, then\nYou probably need to fix something. If not, then the animal may just be\nacclimating (If new or just put into a new setup), or the source of stress was\ntemporary and has already been corrected. Is it a \"Death Sentence\"? No,\ndefinitely Not. So, don't Freak-out and start adding Salt or any of that\nother stuff. Don't start ripping the snake out for Salt Baths, Melafix Dips or\nany of that non-sense. You will just be ADDING stress. Just\nstep back and look at the Big Picture. Observe the snake's behavior. Try to\ncalmly sort out what may be wrong. As stated in the\nJavanicus Caresheet: It could be something as simple as Your kid(s) or 150lbs\nRottweiler bouncing around on the wood floor, or the Thumping from Your too cool\nHome Entertainment System. White Spot Fungus is just an indicator that let's You\nknow that the snake is stressing about something. But it can kill\nYour snake--if You don't do Your Job.\nThis Information is offered on the Acrochordus\njavanicus and Acrochordus arafurae Filesnakes as is. This Information\nis not offered in reference to any snakes other than the Acrochordus\njavanicus and Acrochordus arafurae Filesnakes and even so:\nuse at You Own Risk!\nAdditionally, this caresheet is obviously based upon admittedly limited\nexperience! It is not intend to be a recipe of do this, do this, do this---Bam!\nYou have a cake. It's intent is to offer more of a conceptual understanding of\nthese fascinating creatures and their apparent needs both in the wild and in", "id": "<urn:uuid:04af5650-b7ba-42b0-af26-e8a95cfaedf9>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://acrochordus.com/whitespot.htm", "date": "2013-05-18T05:59:08Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9417677521705627, "token_count": 2763, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Does Turkey offer a model that the Mideast can emulate? avril 13, 2012Posted by Acturca in Moyen Orient, Turquie.\nTags: AKP, Arab Spring, foreign policy, Middle East, Neo-Ottomanism, Nora Fisher Onar, Turkey, Turquie\nThe Daily Star (Lebanon) April 13, 2012, p. 7 Türkçe\nBy Nora Fisher Onar *\nTurkey is often touted as an inspiration for the countries of the rest of the Middle East – a characterization it accepts and pursues. In recent years, Turkish policymakers have worked hard to establish “Turkey Inc.” as the model of a relatively free, stable and increasingly prosperous Muslim-majority country with great economic and foreign policy leverage. But what does the Turkish experience actually represent for the states of the Arab Middle East? How convincing is Turkey, Inc. – and as a model can it really be emulated?\nPerhaps the most attention has been paid to the free and fair rise to power of Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), which Islamist movements in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Syria have heralded as a symbol of Muslim majoritarian democracy – even explicitly referencing it in the names and platforms of their own parties, movements and factions. To both domestic and international observers, this might signal that, like the AKP in Turkey, Islamist parties elsewhere do not seek to dismantle their states’ secular framework – at least for the time being.\nBut in spite of its appeal to both traditional Islamists and “post-Islamists” – that is, those who fully reconcile their particular politico-religious commitments with globalization – the Turkish formula may not be replicable. Civil-military relations in Turkey have undergone a double-sided transformation over recent decades. As a consequence of the intermittent censure by the army, political Islamists had to moderate their demands and practices; simultaneously, the Turkish army – accustomed to the barracks and aware that interference in government hurt Turkey’s international standing – increasingly relied on civilian allies to pursue its agenda vis-à-vis the AKP.\nEventually, the military relinquished control of crucial institutions (such as the National Security Council), and the final showdown over control of the presidency in 2007 was fought not with bullets and tanks, but with Web declarations, public rallies and court cases. A similar tipping point regarding civilian control of the state is hardly a foregone conclusion in countries still under transition, where national militaries continue to exert a dominant presence in political life.\nOther countries in the Middle East also lack the trajectory that Turkey has followed with regard to its economic development. This is particularly true of the export-driven rise of the middle class that has been experienced by religious constituencies across the Anatolian periphery. Such a trend has underpinned the AKP’s moderation, political success and interregional presence. Indeed, Turkey’s recent economic trajectory is a central component of its appeal in the Arab world.\nOver the past decade, Turkey has tripled its Gross Domestic Product and – excluding a dip to minus-4 percent real growth in 2009 – has managed to ride out the global economic crisis with relative equanimity. Commentators have argued that Turkey may be part of a second tier of rising economic powers (alongside such countries as South Korea, Mexico and Indonesia) that is hot on the heels of the Big Four (Brazil, Russia, India and China).\nThis holds two implications: On a symbolic level, the Turkish experience (along with that of Indonesia and Malaysia) has dramatically undermined theories of Islam’s incompatibility with modernization, especially in the arena of economic governance. More tangibly, over the past decade Turkey has actively sought out partners for sustainable trade-driven growth in a region that has been long addled by the heady cocktail of oil wealth and chronic underdevelopment.\nAlthough economic partnerships were in no way guided by Turkish concerns for democratic governance – a reality that was attested to by Turkey’s once cozy ties with authoritarian leaders – they have had unintended consequences with positive implications for political reform. For example, the influx of cheaper, better quality Turkish goods in Syrian markets may have undermined a backbone of President Bashar Assad’s regime: namely the interests of the regime’s business cronies.\nTo understand the parameters of Turkey’s role in the region, we should also acknowledge the sensitivities that have arisen from the Ottoman legacy. Some believe that Ankara seeks to reclaim its historical leadership of the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans, something that can rub interlocutors the wrong way. Hence, Turkish foreign policymakers’ reluctance to employ Ottomanist frames of reference.\nHowever, at the domestic social level in Turkey, there remains a growing receptiveness to self-depiction as the benign heir to the Ottoman Empire. This is evident in the proliferation of cultural commodities that employ Ottoman referents. That is the case of the recent record-grossing film “Conquest 1453,” about what Western historiography calls the “fall” of Constantinople. In the film, Mehmet the Conqueror – played by an actor who bears a remarkable resemblance to a young Recep Tayyip Erdogan – is shown to be a forceful and compassionate protector of Muslims and Christians alike (though there is no mention in the film of Jews). The image of Turkey as a “big brother” to downtrodden Muslims in such places as Palestine, Nagorno-Karabakh, Kosovo, and Bosnia-Herzegovina – characterizes an emerging “neo-Ottomanist” national image that seems to drive Turkish aspirations of regional leadership within the country and amplify Erdogan’s profile abroad. Whether this is a matter of hubris or of genuine capacity remains to be seen.\nA final component that is crucial for evaluating Turkey’s example is that the country has yet to develop a framework for meaningful multiethnic, multisectarian co-habitation. Mounting violence on the part of militant Kurds and the Turkish state’s heavy-handed response has fueled hostility between ordinary citizens.\nFor instance, recent court rulings suggest that vigilante terror toward prominent members of the Armenian and Alevi communities is permissible and will go unpunished. Disturbing numbers of journalists, scholars, and students who have expressed critical views on these fronts have been jailed. There is also deep concern in constituencies that embrace secular lifestyles that recent reforms in fields such as education will yield an ever more restricted Turkish society.\nGiven the need to put its own house in order and the fact that inter-communal tensions across the Middle East are likely to become worse before becoming better, Turkey’s AKP government must take very seriously its mandate to write a new and inclusive Constitution. In the longer tem, Turkey must confront the standing challenge of the region – learning to live together despite differences – a challenge which also happens to be Turkey’s own.\nAt the end of the day, the export of Turkey, Inc. needs stable and predictable conditions in which trade and investment can thrive; hence, the commitment to the “zero problems” policy that Turkey employed with neighbors in its economic and foreign agendas over the past decade. Due to last year’s upheavals in the Arab world, however, this policy is unsustainable. Once well-placed to broker a dialogue between Iran and Israel, Turkey is now more alienated from both countries than before as the two nemeses lock horns in what Graham Allison has called the “Cuban missile crisis in slow motion.”\nShould Israeli-Iranian antagonism spill over into war, the delicate balance in Iraq may unravel into protracted sectarian and ethnic conflict, just as Syria’s brewing civil war may spill over into neighboring Lebanon. But even without an Israeli-Iranian showdown and an intensified conflagration in Iraq and Syria, Turkey’s Kurdish question is, quite literally, kindling awaiting a flame, as attested to by recent clashes during Nevruz, or Nowruz, celebrations. All of this suggests that Turkey’s aspirations to regional leadership are tactically dependent on forestalling an Iranian-Israeli showdown – an end to which it should leverage all its diminished diplomatic capital in the two countries and in partnership with the United States.\nBefore the AKP came to power and the Arab Awakening broke out, the received wisdom was that when it came to Islam, democracy and secularism, one could have any two but never all three. Similarly, doubts have long been expressed about whether political and economic liberalism can thrive simultaneously in a Muslim-majority setting. Taken together, it seems that if the purveyors of Turkey, Inc. can show that liberal economics goes hand-in-hand with liberal democracy in a country that is governed by pious Muslims, then the Turkish model-in-progress may achieve fruition and offer a timely example for the Middle East.\n* Nora Fisher Onar is an assistant professor of international relations at Bahcesehir University in Istanbul.

{"text": "Serving diverse populations has never been a strong suit of the health-care system in general; there are huge disparities in the quality of care between whites and African Americans and Hispanics. The law calls for expanded initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in the health-care profession, as well as improved cultural competency. But this will take time. Meanwhile, the existing force of health-care providers will have to adopt a more multicultural mindset -- and that includes increased multicultural intelligence in marketing communications.\nInsurance companies will face a different set of challenges. The law stipulates that by 2014 states must set up exchanges through which consumers can directly purchase health insurance, and all legal residents will be required to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. That will likely force a change in the traditional model of marketing health insurance from B2B to a more consumer-oriented approach.\nSeveral major insurers already are adding retail locations and kiosks in shopping malls, as well as sponsoring health fairs, The Miami Herald reports. Humana, for example, is offering its members a 5% savings at Walmart stores on purchases of fresh fruits, vegetables and other products that carry the retailer's \"Great For You\" label. Though many of the newly insured will be eligible for subsidized health insurance through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, to be successful, insurance companies, like providers, will need to be ready to address the unique needs of a very different demographic than what they are used to.\nThen there are the pharmaceutical companies. According to Gregg DiPietro, in a blog for Pharm Exec, before the new health-care law, \"pharma built its positioning platform almost entirely on two dimensions: efficacy and safety.\" He adds, \"With the approval of the health care law, the conversation has moved ... to one of overall 'value.' ... Efficacy and safety ... are not enough to carry a product's positioning platform.\"\nDorothy Wetzel, former VP-consumer marketing at Pfizer, offers five questions in a recent blog that any pharmaceutical brand needs to ask itself when considering beefing up its efforts to multicultural consumers:\nWhat is the size of the business opportunity?\nDo multicultural patients approach health issues differently than the general-market patients in their disease state?\n- Do the current messages in your communications resonate with the multicultural patient?\n- Does your current media and tactical plan reach the multicultural patient?\n- Are there organizations that could help accelerate access and the impact of your efforts?\n\"You can't standardize diversity and say that all of our diverse populations need this,\" says Russell Bennet, Vice President of Latino Health Solutions at United Healthcare. \"Each population may need different things.\"\nIf we are to count ourselves among the great nations of the world, then Americans have a moral imperative to increase the quality of health care for all. As multicultural marketers, we can help. There is a need to educate about disparities. There is a need to get the word out to medically underserved folks as to how they can take best advantage of the new health-care options. And there is clearly a need for more research that looks into the impact of race, ethnicity and sexual orientation on how one navigates -- and is navigated -- through the health-care system.\nPerhaps the greatest challenge faced by advertisers will be to make Americans -- in and out of the health-care profession -- aware that we do indeed have a disparities problem. A study conducted last year found that only 59% of Americans were aware of racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Before the ad industry takes on this issue -- and it's a tough one, given the current political climate -- its first job will be to educate health-care providers as well as the general public. Once that 's accomplished, the industry can tackle the challenge of how best to reach multicultural patients as important consumers.", "id": "<urn:uuid:00c459a3-0bdd-4cd0-b1a8-2f1a0d1c8fa4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://adage.com/article/the-big-tent/health-care-law-poses-multicultural-marketing-challenges/237911/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:50:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9567733407020569, "token_count": 782, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "This article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, (MUP), 2005\nEleanor Constance (Ella) Greenham (1874-1957), medical practitioner, was born on 15 April 1874 at Ipswich, Queensland, second child and only daughter of John Greenham, an English-born draper, and his wife Eleanor, née Johnstone, from Ireland. John later established a general store, Greenhams Pty Ltd, in the business centre at Ipswich. Ella attended Ipswich Central Girls' and Infants' School then Brisbane Girls' Grammar School, where she won the English and the natural history prizes. On 1 February 1892 she was the first pupil to be enrolled at Ipswich Girls' Grammar School. There she won the silver medal for the top girl in science and four other prizes. Passing the senior public examination next year and winning six more prizes, she proceeded to advanced studies for university entrance.\nIn 1895 Greenham went to Women's College within the University of Sydney (M.B., Ch.M., 1901), entering the faculty of arts as a necessary preliminary to her medical studies. She was the first Queensland-born woman to graduate in medicine. Registered to practise in Brisbane on 2 May 1901 as medical practitioner no.711, she began work as resident medical officer at the Lady Bowen Hospital, Brisbane, probably becoming the first woman to receive a residential position in a Queensland hospital. Choosing to work in private practice, in 1903 she took rooms in City Chambers, Queen and Edward Streets, Brisbane, moving in 1907 to 284 Edward Street. Although she met opposition from some male colleagues, her bright personality and attentive care gradually attracted patients and she built up a successful practice.\nGreenham was dedicated to her profession and, like many early medical women, she did not marry. She was an accomplished pianist, enjoyed attending the theatre and visiting flower shows and was described as 'a large lady, fond of flowing, floral garments'; at the lady mayoress's 'At Home' in 1904 she wore an Assam silk gown and a hat of blue chiffon. One of the earliest women car-owners in Queensland, she drove a Darracq in 1907 and later a Hupmobile. Indeed, she became a shareholder in the Hupmobile agency, Evers Motor Co. Ltd, Brisbane. She also became chairman of directors of Greenhams Pty Ltd.\nIn 1945 the Queensland Medical Women's Society elected her to honorary membership for her contribution to women's health and in 1953 she was made honorary member of the British Medical Association (Queensland Branch) for fifty years uninterrupted membership. In her eightieth year she retired to 85 Oxlade Drive, New Farm, but she continued to treat her old patients.\nGreenham was a pioneer and a skilful, caring doctor. By her persistence and expertise, she swept away difficulties and opposition, helping to shape the future for women in medicine in Queensland. She died on 31 December 1957 at New Farm and was cremated with Anglican rites.\nLesley Williams, 'Greenham, Eleanor Constance (Ella) (1874–1957)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/greenham-eleanor-constance-ella-12951/text23407, accessed 18 May 2013.\nThis article was first published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, (MUP), 2005", "id": "<urn:uuid:7e523ce5-3bca-4d7d-8599-419324a8ac99>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/greenham-eleanor-constance-ella-12951", "date": "2013-05-18T08:09:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9697415828704834, "token_count": 732, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "Now, I don't know if anyone else has thought of this already, but I have a new gusset option for my britches pattern. I'm super excited. While I love my original gusset, it's roominess and the fact that you can knit from the legs up, I'm smitten with this new gusset. It is very very easy knit and still allows for a nice wide leg, though it only works for the top-down version (I'll figure it out bottom-up some day, the concept is in my head, I just haven't done it yet). I'm putting the finishing touches on the directions and will release it tomorrow to everyone who is on the britches yahoo group.\nAlso, I am revamping the whole pattern. Better pictures, more options, clarified wording on some directions that were ambiguous before. I'm adding a \"no options, just the basics\" beginner pattern that I'm hoping will be a great how-to-knit-longies for a new knitter. Since Adorabubble Britches has been out almost a year now (boy, does time fly), I've gotten lots of feedback, many great questions from beginners and suggestions that will be incorporated into this pattern. Since it is just the basics, I will be offering the beginner pattern for just $4. It will be seperate from the whole Adorabubble Britches pattern, but will come with a coupon for a discount on the big Adorabubble Britches pattern. So, if you like the beginner pattern and want all the options later, you won't have to fork over a ton :-)\nI'm also hard at work on the sideways britches pattern, though this one is a little further away from completion than the others.

{"text": "When I was little I watched over and over — really, I truly, truly loved it — a Masterpiece Theater about three sisters who every night would go to a magical ball, only after the castle is completely asleep. To get to the ball, a porthole opened in their room that led to an enchanted, snow-covered wood and a river, which they crossed on rowboats guided by the three male princes. Every morning, their mother would wake them up and groan over how difficult it was to get the girls out of bed, and every week a maid would grimace over how they had worn out their best dancing slippers. Something was afoot, but they could not name it.\nI could look up the plot — but it isn’t the truth that matters to me now, it’s the story in my head. Next: the parents suspected the daughters of something terrible, something grave, and so locked them in their room; but of course, the girls could still reach the porthole, which was within it. Held to questioning, one of the sisters told of the magical ball. To prove it, she brought back a branch of silvery pine and held it out to her father saying Look, look, it’s real — the trees, the lake, the dancing, and the princes who take us. Here is a metonymy for you, a length of wood.\nBut maybe what happened was that walking, she was snagged in the tree, her dress hitched, and they found, entangled in her silks the next day, a branch.\nIn any case I had not thought of the story for so long. In the end, only the best sister — pure, for some reason that the others are not — marries a magical prince. Perhaps the others are tattle-tales, who give it away. Perhaps they choose the life of reality over the one of fiction.\nWhen I thought of the story today for the first time in years I thought, of course: here is a lesson to parents about raising teenage girls; or here is a lesson to teenage girls about sleeping around, about letting boys into your bedrooms: You will be caught, snagged. You will grasp for him and find only a branch, as evidence. Here is a eulogy for the high schoolers heading out to parties in Potomac, who crash their SUVs on River Road and kill themselves and all their riders — this is the fairy tale for them, who live forever in silent rowboats on dark water, captained by strangers who promise in the distance a glimmering ball.\nI think also it is a parable for dreams, which you can never prove with props or worn-out shoes; and of course as well a parable for romance, which comes to us at night, and wears off in the strange light of the morning; or maybe a parable for love — for the sister who found it — for it comes to us at first through a fiction as if of our own making — it’s our thoughts of him, at first, that woo us. And it’s when you’ve got to prove it, you’ve got to find the branch or not find the branch, you may find that you have nothing at all as evidence; or you might find that you are caught there, and can never row back, and that your sisters — beautiful as they had seemed to you, then — are now forever collapsed into their own world and that your father, glaring down at you, holds none of his angry power; the world of the dream has become potent, the daytime world of slippers and lace is stupid, stupid as a fairy tale, stupid as a place you leave. The real is now the dream you thought you had invented, and you see it in all of its crisp textures.\nAnyway, now I only pity the maid.

It was later taken over by the Croatian soldiers who were fighting in Europe, and a part of their uniform was assumed by the French in the 17th century. Under the leadership of the French „God of Sun\" Louis XIV there was a horsemen unit, the so-called Royal cravate, who wore mostly red collar ribbons. The custom of wearing ribbons from the Croats dates back to this time, which was later expanded around Europe and the world, and today is inevitably the most important detail in men's fashion, and also an original Croatian souvenir.

That is where the name for two Croatias derives from, i.e. White in north and Red in south. When the Croats have selected Ferdinand Habsburg to be their King in Cetine in 1527, they confirmed that choice with some seals, and one of them was Croatian coat of arms, but with 64 fields, i.e. the complete chess-board.

It especially helps if you visit the manufacture website. This was my first buying experience with Altrec.com and it has been very pleasant. Great jacket! Just what I wanted and at the price. Thanks Altrec!!\n- March 5 2011\nAnother fine Carhart product. Purchased a large and I wear a 42 regular, this jacket fits just right. Not too heavy, not too light. Well built and comfortable right out of the package. Just what I was looking for, and got it for the best price on the web. Thanks you Altrec!\n- December 30 2010\nCarhartt makes some of the most durable products on the market. It is made with high quality materials. This Jacket is very warm and comfortable to wear and doesnt feel bulky.\n- December 29 2010\nVery durable, thick material and nice color. Like that it is machine washable and has wide arms for ease of movement. Like that it is cotton and does not make a lot of noise when it is cold outside.

{"text": "There’s no doubt of my affections for the Rich Eisen Podcast (REP). I listen to it every week and over the years it’s easily become my favorite NFL related iPod listens. It’s the perfect combination of everything NFL and pop culture so if that’s right up your alley then this is the podcast for you.\nSo it was a very pleasant surprise when I saw that this week’s episode had NFL Network’s Rich Eisen’s sit down with St. Louis Rams head coach and NFL Competition Committee member Jeff Fisher for the REP’s Combine Special.\nThey chat about Coach Fisher’s first year in St. Louis, the NFL scouting combine, and a few other important Rams topics.\nRich Eisen: How do you rank your first year in St. Louis?\nIt wasn’t a rebuilding year… It was not good enough from our standpoint. We lost games that we had a chance to win early on and throughout the season.\nWe learned a lot. That’s the thing I think is so good about what happened. Our young team learned a lot and we have to learn not to let those things happen again.\nIt’s a real fun team to coach and to win a game on the road was a weird experience because they hadn’t done it in a while.\nOur division is an outstanding division. Arizona came to St. Louis undefeated (in week five). We forget about that at the beginning. It was quite a challenge for us and we were proud of the way they played.\n(I love that Coach Fisher isn’t satisfied. Despite taking a 2-14 team to 7-8-1 in one season he did not mention specific records in the interview. I think most coaches would hung their hat on that sort of improvement. But not Coach Fisher. He just saw that the team is improving and growing towards getting better.)\nRich Eisen: “(James) Laurinaitis and Chris Long came to the set after the game. They said that it had been a very long time since they had played a game with a camera hovering over the middle of the field and the whole country watching. In the end, they were enjoying staying on the set so much Deion asked them to leave. But you could see how much joy they were taking in these moments.”\nIt’s hard you know. No team in a five year span in the history of the NFL lost more games than our organization prior to last year. Winning games is what it’s all about. We won a few and then we had one team in particular that took us ten quarters to beat.\nIt’s funny because you go through that tie experience. But then you play them three weeks later and you’re going to guarantee there’s no way that’s going to happen again. … And we were two minutes away from that happening again.\n(I was at that game and stayed after to see Laurinaitis and Long hang out on the set. They were having a great time and most of all I think they were happy for Rams fans.)\nRich Eisen: “That was unbelievable. People maybe for the next decade having trouble dealing with Colin Kaepernick will have your team to blame. Because it was your team that knocked Alex Smith out of the game and ushering in the whole Kaepernick-ness of it all.”\nSorry about that. I would think the 49er fans are also Rams fans at heart.\n(They can specifically thank Rams LB Jo-Lonn Dunbar and maybe DT Michael Brockers. We believe that it was a combination of Dunbar and Brocker’s hits on Alex Smith in week 10 that ultimately started the Colin Kaepernick era in San Francisco. And no sir. There’s no way any 49ers fans would ever admit to being Rams fans at heart.)\nRich Eisen: “Where do you stand on the whole subject on (Cam Newton, RG3, Colin Kaepernick type) quarterbacks and where offenses are going?”\nWell, we’ve got Carolina this year so we’re going to see that offense five times. So we’ve got work to do as everybody else does. And it doesn’t mean to say that another one is not going to pop up someplace. That’s the challenge of the NFC West is the mobility at the quarterback position. The pistol, the read-option whatever you call it.\nThe NFC East has their own new challenge in Philadelphia with the high tempo. The game changes and you’re forced to adjust on both sides of the ball. Defensively we have to adjust.\nRich Eisen: “What do you think Bradford needs to do to take a step into that elite class?”\nHow about have his second year in the same offensive system? Because this will be the first time he’ll be able to experience that. Last year our offense was his third offense in three years.\nWe need to surround him with better people. He can make all the throws. He’s an outstanding deep ball thrower. He has more mobility than people think. He can run for first downs and do that kind of stuff.\nWe can do a better job of keeping him upright. We did that as we moved through the season and minimized the hits. We need to get some better people. We are working at that.\n(Is Brian Schottenheimer’s offense the best fit for Bradford? I don’t know for sure but giving Bradford another year in the same system is a good way to figure it out. More importantly it sounds like the Rams are serious about getting Bradford the weapons he needs to have that break out season. “Better people” is a very broad term but I’m hoping it means solidifying the offensive line. That should be their number one priority.)\nRich Eisen: “What about Steven Jackson? Is he one of those people?”\nHope so. We are in the middle of that. Steven is out of the country and we are talking to his agent. We’d love for him to have a chance to finish his career with us.\n(I read this as “We’d love to have Jack back but not at the $7 million dollar 2013 price tag.” Coach Fisher keeps talking about his young team and I’m not convinced that Jack is going to be a part of that youth movement. The Rams have Isaiah Pead, Daryl Richardson and Terrance Ganaway waiting in the wings.)\nRich Eisen: “Moving forward what are you hoping to get out of this combine? You saw some kids last year that you drafted that made some immediate impact.”\nJenks (Janoris Jenkins), Tru (Trumaine Johnson), Chris Givens and Daryl Richardson…\nWhat you get out of this is you’ve got to aggressively attack the interview process. Get as much information as you can, ask as many questions as you can, and then hopefully we’re going to get enough guys participate where you’d be able to look and see some athletic ability.\nWe have a pretty good sense of the strengths of this draft. We have a good sense of what we need. We’re either going to do with these guys out here or we are going to try and do it through free agency.\n(Strengths of this draft include safeties, linebackers, and on both sides on the line. Which is great news for the Rams since they need some starters as well as depth in those positions. Mike Mayock of NFL Network believes there isn’t really that Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Luke Kuechly-type star player in the first round of the draft. He said the number 20-25 picks in the draft are just as good as the number 5-10 picks. The Rams could be getting some great players with the 16th and 22nd picks in the first round.)\n(Another quick note: Last year’s draft was orchestrated by General Manager Les Snead and Coach Fisher but they were using information put together by the previous regime’s scouting staff. For this April’s draft Snead will have intelligence gathered by his own people. This can only make things better, right?)\nUpdate from @Shields3L – Most of the scouting staff is still the same from last yr. Only 3 guys gone. (Thanks for the info, Tim.)\nRich Eisen and Coach Fisher continue their conversation changing their focus to what was being discussed by the competition committee which Coach Fisher is a part of. Especially fun was listening to Rich Eisen campaign to get rid of his pet peeve, the Tuck Rule.\nYou can listen to the interview in its entirety here or on iTunes. Coach Fisher’s segment starts around the 45 minute mark.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e36c5622-54a4-4a8d-9390-13aaea58108a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aeryssports.com/the-pigskin-arch/2013/02/28/st-louis-rams-head-coach-jeff-fisher-on-the-rich-eisen-podcast/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:02:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9747774004936218, "token_count": 1850, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Here is my progress on the Oklahoma Backroads workshop that I took with Bonnie Hunter last week. I have 20 blocks complete...only 100 or so more to go! :P\nOne idea Bonnie presented was \"bonus triangles.\" This isn't a new idea to me, but it's one that I was never too excited about. It seemed to take a lot of extra time (it does)...and I wasn't sure the time and effort would be worth it.\nShe pointed out that a couple of her quilts in her newest book \"Scraps & Shirtails 2\" were made almost entirely from these bonus triangles. Hmmm...that had my interest a little more. She also shared a way to make those triangles a size that plays well with other size squares and rectangles. I decided I'd give it a try for this project since I would be making a large amount of those \"half\" flying geese blocks above.\nI'm going to show you the technique for making 2\" unfinished triangles from a 2.5\" unfinished flying geese unit. First, find a business card that is 2\" high and cut a 2\" square from one side.\nNext cut the square on the diagonal to make two triangles.\nNow draw TWO lines on your 2.5\" square...one down the center and one with the business card triangle place in the corner. (click image for a closer view)\nSew along both lines...I sew just inside the center line for better results....\nCut between the two sewn lines. Don't fret about the smaller seam allowance! According to Bonnie, it's going to be okay!! The seam is sewn...it's not going to come apart or anything. If you sew 1/2\" away from the center line (in order to have 1/4\" seam allowance), you'll end up with a HST that is about 1 3/4\"...and that dimension doesn't play well with anything else!\nPress both pieces and viola!\nBefore long, you'll have a pile of HST like this! This isn't even all of them....\nLook what I made from 90 bonus triangles!! This is the Quilt Square Quilt Along block for April. How perfect is that? My block is a little bigger than the pattern, because my triangles are bigger, but I think that's okay, right? I love it. I added a small border and I'm going to finish it for a pretty table topper.

{"text": "Eventually, new multiplexes such as the Arclight and the Grove opened nearby and began nabbing the artful specialty films that had long been the Sunset 5’s exclusive domain.When a small business closes in the face of competition from larger firms, it's common to hear complaints about the capitalist system -- along with calls for subsidies or government protection (such as having the location designated a \"historical landmark\"). So I was pleasantly surprised to read the next line:\nSuch is the forward motion of time and commerce.I appreciate and respect the owners' choice to accept the theater's fate with equanimity.\nFor those worried about the lack of venues for independent films, two things: First, as the quote above indicates, the Arclight and Grove theaters were able to squeeze out the Laemmle Sunset 5 in part because they offered independent fare in addition to the usual major-studio movies. And second, the Sunset 5 has been acquired by Robert Redford's Sundance Cinemas, which is currently renovating the theater. As Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, says in the linked article: \"Maybe fresh blood will bring new life into the theater and come new cash too. A face lift on the theater may attract new audiences and make it a place to be.\" Only time will tell.\nUPDATE (added immediately after posting): Before anybody says it, I should point out that the Laemmle family will do just fine. They have other theaters, including new ones opening elsewhere in the L.A. area. Obviously, it would be harder for someone who owned only one location to greet the news with such equanimity. Nevertheless, I respect how the Laemmles responded. Moreover, the usual calls for subsidy and protection don't just come from the small business owners, but from people who have an interest in the business, including suppliers (like indie producers) and devoted customers.

{"text": "Saturday, May 29, 2010\nJim, my personal library, recently gave me an American classic: \"The Making of the President: 1960\" by Theodore H. White.\nThe book chronicles Teddy White's experiences along the campaign trail with Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The writing is outstanding and the insights are second to none. There are countless political observations that are as true today as they were 50 years ago. However, none of those are what stand out for me. There are two paragraphs that are extremely eerie though the power of retrospection.\nThe first is on Page 372, when talking about Kennedy and The Oval Office: \"When the windows are closed, the sound of Washington traffic, which hums as it passes by outside, is entirely locked out, and one is reminded that these windows are three inches thick of laminated glass, thick enough to stop an assassin's rifle bullet from beyond the grounds -- if the assassin gets time enough to sight.\"\nThe other disturbing reference is to a day in the life of John F. Kennedy. On page 375, Teddy White wrote: \"Then the supreme and somber problem of war and peace: a long meeting of one and one quarter hours in the cabinet room with Secretary of State Dean Rusk; Secretary of National Defense Robert S. McNamara; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Lyman Lemnitzer; Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander-in-Cheif, Pacific theatre; two personal advisers McGeorge Bundy and Walter Rostow; and Vice-President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson. Here at this meeting he considered, not for the first time but for the decisive [Whit's italics, not mine] time, American response to the newest thrust of Communist pressure on the changing world -- the movement of Communist guerillas over the jungles and ridges of Southeast Asia into the formless Kingdom of Laos. Could anything be done there, and if it could, should anything be done there? This was the ugliest of problems; and if his decisions were right the meeting would fade into history as unimportant; but if the decisions brought war, then this, indeed, was where the Americans chose war.\"\nI think we can say that the president decided wrong that day.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0b410f0f-8b17-4f80-9b51-77574c2ef7cb>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ahoyhanoi.blogspot.com/2010_05_29_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:12:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9645270109176636, "token_count": 468, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

It tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people and has a maximum ferry range of 560 miles and service ceiling of nearly 28,000 feet. The helicopter was built by state-owned Avic, the same company that recently made Chinese-market Sikorsky S-76 airframes under contract.\nChina is expected to modify its low-altitude airspace restrictions over the\nnext few years, a move that could trigger demand for more than 1,000 new civil helicopters there over the next two decades. Part of its strategy for meeting that demand appears to be leveraging current and future relations with established Western helicopter manufacturers to build its own helicopter industry.\nLast week China flew a new home-grown heavy-lift helicopter for the first time.

{"text": "Latest Team Rankings\nFree Text Alerts\n|College Teams||High Schools|\nMay 24, 2012Auburn heads into the 2012 season looking for better production defensively, and the Tiger coaching staff has brought in the type of players in the past few recruiting classes that are capable of competing at a high level in the SEC.\nThere is always at least one, if not more, players who come out of nowhere and make a big impact on the season every year. A great example would be Nick Fairley, who jumped onto the scene in a big way in 2010, winning the Lombari Award and playing a big role in Auburn's BCS national championship.\nIf Auburn is to compete for championships in the near future, the Tigers will need all the depth possible, particularly along the all-important defensive line.\nOver the next few days we will be making a list of the most underrated youngsters at each position beginning today with the defensive line.\nJustin Delaine (6-foot-5, 280 pounds, Sophomore)\nDelaine was signed to Auburn as a big-bodied athlete with potential to get bigger, and become a force up front defensively.\nThe Linden (Ala.) product was very raw when he stepped on Auburn's campus for the first time, but has shown signs of being able to contribute. Delaine has great athleticism blended with great size, and a long, and lanky frame.\nOnce Delaine learns how to use that frame, he should be able to make some plays for the Tigers going forward. Delaine is very light on his feet to be so big, but doesn't distribute his balance evenly enough, or consistently enough to maintain a strong pass rushing position.\nIf Delaine can improve his power, along with his balance, Auburn could have a diamond in the rough waiting off the edge.\nKeymiya Harrell (6-foot-4, 260 pounds, RS Freshman)\nHarrell showed vast improvement after sitting his first season on the plains by way of a redshirt. One of Harrell's biggest problems early on as a true freshman was his ability to attack the blocker, then shed the blocker, and then go make the tackle.\nOnce Harrell improved his technique, and finally started using his hands to help him, good things began happening.\nAuburn still needs more depth up front on defense, especially with rival teams like Alabama and LSU deploying smash mouth offenses.\nIf Harrell can keep on progressing at his current rate, he should become a very effective hybrid-type defensive lineman.\nJabrian Niles (6-foot-2, 297 pounds, RS Freshman)\nNiles did some good things this past spring, even earning mention from defensive line coach Mike Pelton.\nHowever, the redshirt freshman still has a long way to go to become a complete player.\nThe Mobile (Ala.) product is great at attacking a gap, and then re-directing in the backfield to make a play. His problem at Auburn so far has been getting able to get through that gap to go make the play.\nOnce Niles gets into position to tackle a ball carrier, he is great at finishing plays. Another dimension Niles brings on the inside, is an above average ability to rush the passer.\nHaving an inside pass rusher that can create havoc on second, and third and long is a deadly weapon. Look for Niles continue being brought along slowly, but don't be surprised if he gets a few looks this fall.\nTyler Nero (6-foot-2, 290 pounds, Freshman)\nNero is a very mature inside defensive lineman with great character, and uses his hands at the point of attack like an SEC veteran.\nWatching Nero is exciting because he is quick, and extremely agile off the ball. Nero has incredible instincts, which make him a very consistent tackler, and a constant threat to force fumbles.\nAnother great thing about Nero's game is his effort, and it shows in his game tape. There is nothing an offensive lineman hates more than a big guy that never quits.\nGimel President (6-foot-3, 240 pounds, Freshman)\nPresident is a very underrated prospect who will to Auburn this fall, and his offer list coming out of high school shows it.

{"text": "Sir Gregory Ander\nSir Gregory Ander was born and bred in Queensland, within view of Hartleigh Castle. Born to middling nobles of Alderclass, Gregory was the last of six boys. His elder brothers followed in their father’s footsteps as advocates at Queen Maelys’s Court, but Gregory always sought something a bit more exciting than pushing paper and defending the ruffians in the streets of Hartleigh City.\nWhen he was sixteen, Gregory’s father arranged for him to be accepted into one of the knighting orders, the Order of the Oak, upon the death of Gregory’s closest brother, Bram. The Order of the Oak was not the initial choice of the family, for the Order of the Rose–being the Queen’s personal guard–have a great deal more prestige. Regardless, once initiated, Gregory had little say unless the Queen changed her mind or promoted him elsewhere.\nGregory, being both crafty and handsome, quickly rose through the ranks, and was granted full knightship on the even of his twentieth birthday. He was conspicuously late to his knighting, however, having been spotted with a noblewoman some time before. What a messenger knight was doing in the company of such a woman was certainly up for speculation.\nIt was two weeks later that the very same noblewoman was discovered dead in her apartment. While Sir Ander was no where near the woman’s abode at the time, and therefore could not have been involved directly–so the advocates from his family argued at court–he was acquitted of all charges. The advocates on behalf of the woman’s family, Fortesque & Nob, filed an official complaint after the trial, but it was quickly thrown out by the High Counselor herself, having noted that a decision was made and the law would be upheld.\nAs a messenger knight, Sir Ander is frequently dispatched up and down the Continent, and sometimes across the sea and into the Isles, as well. While his fellow knights are extremely loyal to him, and have only the most glowing comments to make on his behalf, some will tell you different. If you visit some of the seedier establishments in the Territories, for instance, not a few Innkeepers will tell you about the fresh-faced Oaksguard with a penchant for roughing up their girls.\nSir Ander is a man of contradictions. He is young, but jaded; clever, but arrogant; passionate, but cruel–he loves the attentions of women, but cannot stand their company.\nWhen Sir Ander walked into the Territories towns to collect Alderclass girls on an errand from the Queen, he used her writ as absolute law, reportedly threatening violence should the towns not cooperate and hand over their young women. And it is rumored that what violence was seen was due to his command, though it has officially been blamed on an interruption by the Order of the Asp.\nProfile: Sir Gregory Ander\n- Height: 6′ 0″\n- Eye Color: Dark brown\n- Hair color: Chestnut brown, curly\n- Age: 23 Years\n- Hobbies: A collector of “ancient” weaponry, as well as books on the subject. Is known to have a particularly dedicated interest in the use of torture in war times.\n- Issue: None, rumored to have impregnated a noblewoman\n- Spouse: None; knights are not allowed to marry\n- Fashion: Wears the typical garb of the Order of the Oak, which includes a blue silk sash around the wide-brimmed hats, a green vest, and a long, gray duster.

{"text": "Welcome to Alexandra's House\nLife is full of uncertainty with no guarantees. If the life expectancy of your unborn, newborn, or infant is limited, Alexandra’s House is here to help. Many services are provided directly through Alexandra’s House and others are coordinated through a variety of community resources. Residential care is available for those meeting specific criteria.\nAlexandra’s House is a community based, all volunteer, peer-led perinatal hospice and infant care system for parents pregnant with babies with lethal or sub-lethal anomalies, for pregnancies that end unexpectedly at any point, from any cause, and for infants who die in the community, any cause. While its foundation is rooted in faith, its services offer a practical solution in meeting the time-intensive needs of families in these situations.\nAlexandra’s House does not interfere with or substitute for any existing medical, social, or hospice agencies’ services. What it does is to help fill in the many gaps in care that do exist, as defined by those who have lived the experience of caring for a dying unborn or newborn baby. The ideal time to consult Alexandra’s House is at the time of diagnosis or loss: a) so parents are fully informed and b) to help alleviate some of the acute anxiety and very common feelings of isolation and abandonment. Alexandra’s House does not charge for its services nor does it accept contributions from people they serve.\nOver 90% of our referrals come from the medical community – perinatologists, hospitals, doctor’s offices, sonographers, the community at large and through our website. We have followed families in America as far away as Alaska and have provided assistance in the UK, France, Germany, and New Zealand.\nServices include: bringing meaning to suffering, assistance in grief resolution, parent-parent partnering, birth planning, funeral planning, long-term support, one to one and group meetings, pre-natal and post-natal housing, if required. If a baby survives and is dismissed from the hospital, the family and baby can stay here for the duration of their life. Professional nursing services are provided through a licensed hospice agency.\nShe never opened her eyes but I already knew her eyes sparkled like the night sky. Sophia, born an angel, that God already needed. Her life lasted only a few hours but changed by life forever. Only the best die young. Sophia deserved the life that she will never be able to experience but we will life through her. She made the biggest impact on my life even though she'll never know it.\nIt was a rainy day. I was at the hospital because my Baby sister was born her name was Sophia. I held her. She was light like a pillow. It was fun. I like it I miss Sophia\nWe talked to our kids this weekend, and they were so individual, heartbroken and sweet. Our daughter, Annie, said she thought God must have put four seeds inside of me when I was created and one was an angel seed. So I had three babies and now I would have the angel baby. That's the story I am going with from now on because it sounds just perfect to me. Our oldest, Leo, was the most emotional.\nJoy and Joya were twins, very special twins. They were joined at the chest and shared one heart. After complex testing prenatally, it was determined that Joy and Joya could not be separated surgically. Neither would survive the surgery.\nTen fingers and ten toes - that's the first thing every parent checks on their newborn. For the parents of Alexandra's House those simple things are not taken for granted. I am Jeanette Burlbaw, a sonographer with 35 years of experience.

Federal Trade Commission reports show tax-related identity fraud continues to plague the United States, most notably South Florida, where more than half of the 20,000 Florida identity fraud cases to the IRS have been detected.\n“It has become too easy and far too common for criminals to obtain the taxpayer identification numbers of people and file fraudulently in their name,” West said. “Today’s meeting with the IRS allowed me to hear directly from the agency as to what investigators are doing to prevent this crime. I challenge the IRS to determine a more efficient system for tracking who these criminals are and how they are obtaining taxpayer identification numbers.”\nIRS leaders discussed with Congressman West several new systems implemented this year to identify and track fraud, including a “detection code” assigned to suspicious filings.\n“I can assure you, we are getting better everyday,” Jodi Patterson, Director of Return Integrity with the IRS, told Congressman West. ”This is a top priority for the IRS.”\nPatterson also assured Congressman West the IRS is improving its system for how operators handle taxpayers who believe their identity has been stolen.\n“We have spent a great deal of time training our operators on how to interact and best help expedite the reporting process, ” Patterson said.\nWest asked the IRS to report back to him at the end of April on improvements the IRS has made over last year, including a report of indicators and warnings the IRS has discovered through its investigation. West also encouraged the IRS to work with local law enforcement to better track down criminals on a local level.\n“Our local law enforcement is well aware of this problem and they want to be involved,” West said. ”I am confident the IRS is listening to our concerns and will continue tracking down these criminals until this problem is solved.”\nPLEASE SIGN UP FOR ALL CONGRESSMAN ALLEN WEST’S E-NEWSLETTERS: west.house.gov", "id": "<urn:uuid:9a9d34ad-e1f5-413c-80f0-057b94bb6b47>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://allenwestrepublic.com/tag/congressman-west/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:50:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9489744305610657, "token_count": 452, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

It had been a rough day, and I had to be out of work at 3:30 because I had clinical that evening. ...by Ms Kylee Aug 20, '08It had been a rough day, and I had to be out of work at 3:30 because I had clinical that evening.\nI was doing the usual end of shift vitals when I walked past what had been an empty room all day. In the room chair sat a very petite lady looking very lost and scared.\nI walked in, shook her hand, and introduced myself. She told me her name, and followed it by \"I had a doctor's appointment today and he sent me right here and wouldn't tell me why. I don't have anything either. He wouldn't let me go back home and pack a bag.\"\nI told her that we had stuff on the unit, and I'd pack her up a goodie bag and be right back. I returned a few minutes later with the usual patient goodie bag, blankets, gown, lift pad, towels, washcloths, and tissues.\nSensing she wanted to keep her independence, I handed her the gown and asked her if she needed any help getting undressed. She told me no, but asked me to stay with her anyway. After getting her vitals and getting her into bed, I found her nurse and told gave her a report. I followed it up with her being very scared. I stayed with her for another hour and missed clinical, but it was worth every hour I had to make up.\nI had the pleasure of taking care of her for almost two weeks. During her stay, we had wonderful talks and she told me all about her life, her family, and she gave me a wonderful recipe for red gravy. One morning, I was told she needed to go downstairs for a test. I brought the stretcher in to her room and I could tell immediately she was scared. As she got on the stretcher she said to me \"Kylee, I'm scared I won't survive this test.\" I tried to offer reassurance, but nothing came past the lump in my throat. Instead, I gave her a big hug. Before I could think of something to say in reassurance, transport came to take her downstairs.\nTwo days later, I returned from my day off, and didn't see her name on my patient list. As I was puzzling things out, the nursing assistant that I was relieving came to give me report.\nWhen she gave me the first report, my stomach just dropped. My beloved patient had stroked and was life flighted over to our trauma hospital. I held things together till report was finished, then I made a visit to the bathroom and cried my eyes out. When I returned to the floor five minutes later, I got funny looks from the staff, but nobody asked me, and I didn't volunteer any information.\nA week later, I read her obituary in the paper, and I cried as I read it.\nAll I could remember was how she had told me she was afraid to go for the procedure, and how she felt she had another few years of life left to give. I also remembered how she loved bread from an Italian restaraunt in town. I remembered that last hug, and those final words she said to me. \"Kylee, I love you. You're going to be a wonderful nurse someday.\"\nRIP Miss B. I love you too.Last edit by Ms Kylee on Aug 21, '08 : Reason: fixed typo\nPrint and share with friends and family.\nCompliments of allnurses.com.\nhttp://allnurses.com/showthread.php?t=327323©2013 allnurses.com INC.

Hello All, I've been using AllNurses since I began in nursing school but this is my first post....by It's Just a Ride Nov 23, '12Hello All,\nI've been using AllNurses since I began in nursing school but this is my first post. I had a patient in clinical this week and my priority diagnosis isn't completely clear to me.\nThis elderly patient was in the CCU after an AMI with CHF ~ 45 days prior, history of hypertension, diabetes, family Hx of heart disease. He has a trach/vent in place and appears to be unable to wean due to the potential for right side heart failure.\nHis heart is the problem. He's on the vent because his heart can't handle the increased workload, SO, I'm thinking Decreased Cardiac Output as my priority, but they've drilled ABC's into our brains so many times a little voice is telling me \"B comes before C,\" but it's the heart, not lungs, that are the real issue. Right?\nAlso, could I simlpy use AEB AMI, and ventilator dependency? Your insights are appreciated.\nPrint and share with friends and family.\nCompliments of allnurses.com.\nhttp://allnurses.com/showthread.php?t=799002©2013 allnurses.com INC. All Rights Reserved.\n- 584 Views\n- Nov 23, '12 by ImKosherWhat's your related factors? What is your A/E/B? Following your ABC, we need to figure out if the airway and lungs is contributing to his condition at all and if it priority. Tell us a little more about the pt.\n- Nov 23, '12 by It's Just a RideAside from the Hx I mentioned (HTN, diabetes, fam Hx of heart disease), the pt had no indication of CHF until he was braught in for the AMI. He was described as a stable, critical patient. Stable on the vent, critical off of it.\nI was thinking Decreased Cardiac Output or Inneffective Tissue Perfusion, but he is stable currently so those would be \"risk for\" at the moment, right? A therefor wouldn't be used as primary diagnoses. He's on bedrest, NPO, trach/vent, and was in between an NG and PEG tube placement when I was work with him. He is dependent, alert and oriented, and denied any pain although he had a nasty ulcer on the posterior left wrist from dopamine infiltration.\nHis airway has some mucus production so I could go that direction. He required suctioning twice while I was there. His breathing is controlled by the vent. His heart is stable provided his lungs have assistance from the vent.\nThese diagnoses usually make sense to me but after my first day on CCU I'm not sure what direction this should be going.\n- Nov 23, '12 by fireballnursieInsufficient gas exchange related to decreases cardiac function as evidence by inability to ween off artificial life support.\n- Nov 23, '12 by It's Just a RideI can see this connection. Thank you very much FireBall.\nAnd thank you Kosher for the input.\n- Dec 1, '12 by GrnTeaThat would be \"decreased,\" \"wean,\" and we don't say \"artificial life support\" for something like this.\nLet's back up here.\nHow do you know he's on the vent because his right heart might not be able to manage without it? It may be that the work of breathing is just more than he can handle, and if he isn't ventilated mechanically he will not be able to move enough air to stay alive. He is old and has a bad heart, and that resulting weakness may be the reason he's on the vent. The vent doesn't decrease right heart workload per se.\nHowever, decreased cardiac output itself would certainly cause him to be weak. Seems to me that he has at least two priority problems: he can't move enough air to support himself, and his heart is too weak to support any activity. Now, go to your NANDA-I 2012-2014, which every nursing student should have even if his/her faculty neglected to put it on the bookstore list (free 2-day shipping from Amazon), and see what nursing diagnoses fit these defining characteristics. That's how you determine nursing diagnoses-- you identify the defining characteristics by your own assessment, then see what diagnoses they point to. It's just like checking a hematocrit to help make the medical diagnosis of anemia.\nI hope you haven't already turned this in, because in my opinion you're a little confused about cause and effect here. Hope we hear back from you.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2125b549-64b3-4c17-a9d0-5ce81c17ea0d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://allnurses.com/nursing-student-assistance/priority-diagnosis-question-799002.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:12:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9751090407371521, "token_count": 1042, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean;Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

We have the guild leader, Beastar, here to tell us more about the guild.Guild: Dead Faction\nCan you give us a little history about Dead Faction?\nDead Faction is a guild created few month ago. Since I started to play in April 2010, its was one of my goals to create a guild.\nSo, I made it with some people that I knew well for a bit. At this moment, we decided our ultimate objective. The ”ultimate objective ” of Dead Faction was (and still) to help new peoples and obtain an Astral ship. Now, we have around 130 members and we are always talking in the chat or partying in Lightwood tavern XD. We’re all happy of what we achieved and we hope to continue our mission.\nWhat are the people of Dead Faction like?\nLet’s say, we have every kind of player: high level, PvP, occasional players, hardcore, clown (yeah, some of us are really funny), beginner, every class and every race! We are really opened to all class, races, and levels. That makes us unique. Nobody feel like being in a sea of people, everyone is important.\nThat’s what we are!\nWhat are the goals of Dead Faction?\nAs I said, our goal is to obtain an Astral ship (and maybe a fleet of Astral ships!) and help everyone. If someone is level 40 and need a party for a dungeon, we’ll help him or her. If a level 10 wants to understand how the game works, we’ll help him or her. Sometimes (in fact everyday), we like to travel to Holy Land and do what we call ” Imperial Hunting”. Its some kind of PvP against imperial players. Every month, we organize guild events (like parties, Goblinball,) and we’re really happy about it.\nHow would one go about joining Dead Faction?\nNone. There’s no criteria. We accept everyone. Every class, race, level, etc. As long as you’re online at least one time every month. Other then that, we’re open to anyone who wants to join.\nWhat do you see in Dead Faction’s future in Allods Online?\nI see the whole guild in the most spectacular fleet of Astral ships, having combat and many exploration in the Astral :), making gigantic war in Nezebgrad and Holy land. That how I saw our future, with a lot of enjoyment and happiness (and party ;p ).\nIf you’re part of a guild and you would like to have your guild in the spotlight, please have your guild leader email us with information about your guild at email@example.com!\nAdd Your Comments", "id": "<urn:uuid:1db0462a-be7f-4845-a9af-4dfb01610d11>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://allods.gpotato.com/news/2011/10/16/guild-spotlight-dead-faction/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:25:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9508643746376038, "token_count": 591, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "SwiftKey Keyboard for Android Gets Smarter\nThe autocorrect function on smartphone keyboards can be helpful, but it can also lead to some hilarious and embarrassing mistakes. SwiftKey, a virtual keyboard for Android, looks to eliminate those errors by learning how you type and predicting what you’ll write next, and it’s getting smarter.\nToday, TouchType, the developers of SwiftKey, released an updated version of the keyboard that brings more intelligent correction capabilities and an improved user interface.\nNew to SwiftKey 3 is a feature called “Smart Space.” This detects when you’ve inserted a space in the middle of a word or forgotten to insert spaces while quickly typing a string of words and automatically corrects it for you.\nThe keyboard also now has a larger space bar and a smart punctuation key that gives you quick access to common punctuation. You can also change up the look of the keyboard with two new themes, one called “Cobalt” and another called “Holo,” which looks similar to the keyboard in Android’s latest operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich.\nFinally, SwiftKey 3 adds support for seven additional languages, including Korean, Serbian and Farsi, bringing the total number of supported languages to 42.\nSwiftKey is different from other virtual keyboards like Swype because it tries to customize itself to the user.

As a result, both the hustle and bustle of city life and the calm serenity of country life appeal to me and have equally influenced much of my work. I have been drawing since I was able to hold a crayon and have mainly worked on very small intricate pictures but have discovered the joy of painting on canvas over the last couple of years along with the excitement of creating large pieces of artwork. The smallest painting I have done was 30 x 40 cm, but as well as several others, I am currently working on a piece of art which is around ten feet long which will be eventually be included on here as well. I often work from photographs which are given to me and paint a large, stylized version to hang on the wall. Of course, many pieces I have done have been personal to the requester and since these tend to be friends, little money changes hands. But now I am working on some that I have chosen myself and that I hope to sell to help my son through university.There are not many to display yet, but I hope you like what you see.

{"text": "My number one obsession is my hair. I’m constantly obsessing over it because it’s the best accessory any women can have. Short, long, curly or straight your hair compliments you and shows off your unique style. You could be wearing the best outfit and the killer heels but if your hair isn’t cooperating and you're having a bad hair day, then honey I’m sorry but your outfit is not complete. I could be in sweats and sneakers but as long as my hair looks good that’s all I care about. The trick to great hair is to find out what works for you. What works for someone with curls may not work with someone who has straight hair. You may have to experiment with different brands be it high end or drugstore to see what’s the perfect combination for you. My mother is a hairdresser so I definitely get my obsession from her! I have curls but I use different hair products when it’s curly and different products when it’s straight.\nYou also have to be conscious of your hair cut. For example, a blunt hair cut is a huge don’t for someone like me with curly hair. That would send my hair into frizz hell! Unless you are planning to keep your hair straight all the time (something I’ve done for the right haircut) then something like that wouldn’t be for you. My tips for great hair are\n- Find yourself a great hairdresser who understands your hair.\n- Experiment with products that work for you.\n- A great haircut makes all the difference!\nWhat hair products do you live by?

{"text": "\"I think it would be valuable if we had... uh... I mean, there's some sense where blogs correct themselves if you read enough of them, but I still I think it would be good if we had some sort of, you know, blogging -- you know -- council, where we could condemn people. Sort of... responsible body. You could still blog if you want. Nobody's going to stop you. But we're going to... everybody's gonna know that you're not to be trusted... unless you can sort of apologize or answer for yourself.\"I thought it was revealing, and I used the quote (cut down a bit) in my NYT column yesterday. (Free here.)\nOn the blog, I said I was \"put off by the mindset he revealed\" -- that desire to \"blacklist\" -- and in the NYT, I called it the \"impulse to control.\"\nAlterman is right to read my quoting and characterization as a very harsh accusation. I wouldn't call it \"the typical liberal tendency toward fascism,\" as he does. If I was going to use the inflammatory word \"fascism,\" I wouldn't say \"the typical liberal tendency toward fascism,\" which makes no sense to me. At the very least, I'd replace \"liberal\" with \"left-wing\" or \"illiberal.\"\nThe idea of fascism does come up in the comments. In the second comment, Jeff says: \"The leftist will to power (and more importantly, control) rears its ugly head.\" A little further down, Mike just says: \"Fascism - Oppressive or dictatorial control.\" And John takes a hard (but humorous) swipe:\nAlterman is one of those pathetic little mediocrities who in another time and place would be a very dangerous person. Put him Weimar Germany, revolutionary France or early Soviet Russia and he would be full fledged rhetorical thug pushing the brown shirted masses to smash windows and heads. As it is, he is just fascist little prick whom you hope will disappear like a rash if properly ignored. I almost hope he would start such a council just so I can start blogging and get on the blacklist.Later, Mike comes back with:\nI don't think Eric Alterman is a fascist (though he is many other disagreeable things) but I find it amusing that it is his ilk who are prone to hurl that term, yet it is they who are the control freaks.So Alterman is right to feel provoked and, really, embarrassed to have shown so much of an urge to repress and control. His own words were telling. It's not my habit to type out spoken word, and I don't monitor Bloggingheads episodes for stray quotes to use to make people look bad. That quote jumped out at me and demanded transcription. And I think Eric knows he was saying something bad. The pattern of the stammer, with the double \"you know,\" is telling.\nLet's work our way through Eric's reverie.\n1) It was a conversation. I was just sort of musing.Right! That's why it's so interesting. The things people say when they let their guard down...\nBut still, it's fair game.Damn right.\n2) I do actually believe what I said. Ever since the beginning of blogging-time, I have worried -- in public and on blogging panels -- about the loss of the media's gatekeeper function. Now, I believe I literally wrote the book on this topic -- and it's about to go out of print for the second time, so if you don't own it, hassle Cornell University Press -- and I am as aware as anyone on earth, I believe, of the dangers of the misuse of that function. Almost all of my books deal with this tension in one way or another. But the fact is, the function is absolutely necessary. A democracy of hundreds of millions of people is functionally impossible for reasons it requires an entire book to explain. Particularly when the media profess to strive toward objectivity, punditry/gatekeepers play a crucial role. My problem with the punditocracy has never been that they are pundits, but that they are so incompetent at the job they do.There you have it. Controlling speech seems to be his mission in life. What's he really saying here? He writes books, and he's obsessed with speech, but he's none too articulate.\nThe \"function\" of \"gatekeeping\" is \"absolutely necessary.\" And, speaking of functions, something is \"functionally impossible.\" On a quick read, I thought he was saying that gatekeeping -- that function -- is functionally impossible. But no, what is functionally impossible is democracy. But you'll have to read his book to understand why. Here we see even more of the urge to control.\nYou can't have your democracy, and there are a lot of complex reasons why you can't, as elite, intellectual study shows. I own the truth. I write the books. If you can get your hands on the hard-to-find book and spend some good long time with it, you might come to understand what I already know. I am the gatekeeper of this information explaining why you can't have democracy. Trust me.\nNotice that phrase \"media's gatekeeper function.\" The media deliver information, but Alterman characterizes that as gatekeeping. The emphasis is on what they don't let out. Not having read his book, I'm not sure what he's driving at in point #1. I get the sense it's that voters are dependent on the media filtering the information well, and bloggers ought to improve that filtering, not bypass it. You don't want too much information, because it might be bad.\n3) If bloggers are going to perform this function -- that is, helping busy and usually uninformed people make sense of the world -- we are going to have to employ some sort of standard with which to judge their reliability. If they are pathological liars, psychopaths, religious or ideological extremists who cannot be trusted to tell the truth, well then, it'd be useful to have them branded as such -- in order to keep them from further infecting the body politic with even more lies, ideological obsessions, and intellectual corruptions. True, the mainstream media do not do a great job of this themselves anymore, but many people inside it do try. In many cases, their brands and relationship to their peers depend on it.Speech as disease! Some speakers are sick, and they may cause infection! He would justify quarantines. This man does not believe in free speech. He will not put his faith in the marketplace of ideas and the remedy of more speech.\n4) Bloggers tend to argue that this problem will sort itself out over time.That's scarcely some eccentric blogger thought. It's the core idea of American free speech.\nI worry about the \"over time\" part. I also worry about all the damage that can be done in the interim.This is the mindset of a censor. Of course, you mean well. You're here to save us from ourselves.\nAnd so I raised it on Bloggingheads.tv and offered up a notion in response. Maybe it's a bad idea. It's not as if I gave it any thought before I said it.Well, you did write those books. This is your area of expertise, isn't it? It's just that you let the words tumble out this time, and it showed more ugliness that you would have liked. If only you could control things more, control freak.\nBut I'm not convinced it is [a bad idea]. Or at least, I've yet to see a better one. After all, it's a panel of bloggers; it's the judgment of one's peers and it would enjoy no power whatever, save the influence it amasses by virtue of the quality of its judgments. Just what is so threatening about that?I'm not threatened by your panel. I simply loathe your censorious frame of mind, your fear of speech as sickness, your urge to control and purify, and your belief in the beneficence of panels. I thank God that I live in a country where the institution you dream of would not be allowed to \"enjoy power.\"\nSo now, instead of quivering in fear about what my supposed \"peers\" would like to do to me, I'll have another cup of coffee and a nice little giggle over the way you finally expressed some faith in the marketplace of ideas -- when it came time to talk about why your damned panel should be trusted.\nI love a little irony in the morning.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a8954203-691a-4614-b96f-77cde88d379c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/02/eric-alterman-contemplates-whether-he.html?showComment=1172681220000", "date": "2013-05-18T06:54:37Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9769275784492493, "token_count": 1786, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Really it is a subjective thing and the bride and groom get the only votes.\nI don't see how it can be bad etiquette if the bride and groom were happy to see her there.Did she send a gift?\nThat's a lovely picture at the link.\nIf I understood the article correctly the bride and groom left their event to see her, not the other way around. And they were evidently thrilled to see her. She neither tried to, nor did, upstage the bride.Are you practicing writing headlines for the MSM, Ann?\n\"a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures. The newlyweds now had another reason to grin from ear to ear as they were overheard saying “we’ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our wedding”. She was invited. Post fail.\nPer the article, Palin was in one area and the wedding party was in another. I'm sure you've all been in restaurants with similar semi-separate function halls. The couple sought her out, not the other way around. No foul. No bad etiquette.\n\"The couple seemed happy about it, so yes.\"Did they have much choice?

How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?\"Again, it appears they left their party in a back room and came out to see Palin. And Palin has never struck me as the type of person who would barge in on a wedding party. Hillary sure. Barry definitely. Palin, I don't see it. Maybe she did, but that's not what the article says.So, yes, I'd say they had a choice.Seriously, the guy is a US Marine. I doubt you could find many who wouldn't be thrilled to see her. And that includes the wife of one.\n\"Ann Althouse said...Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?\"Let me go out on a limb...they could have not asked her?\nI don't see how it would mar \"her day\", but I do see how it would make it far more memorable for their guests, and I think all couples want that. I assume the woman was just as pleased as she sounds, and that she wouldn't have left her wedding reception to hit the chicken wing counter for just anyone.\nLimbaugh did that.He crashed some wedding reception that happened to be going on in the hotel where he was.Invited by a band member he ran into.It also turned out to be a military groom; and likewise got a favorable reaction from them.\n\"I am challenging you to think more deeply.\"If thinking deeply means reading things into the article that are not there, I guess I could come up with a dozen possible senarios.So, yeah, if Palin had without invitation entered the back room where a private bridal party was being held for a photo op that would have been a violation of etiquette. It also would have been politically stupid.But I don't see Palin as either rude enough to do it nor, at this stage in her political career, stupid enough to do it.\n\"Ann Althouse said...I am challenging you to think more deeply.\"Everything in the artice points to a joint decision to ask Palin for pictures, as well as a mutual satisfaction that she did so.I am challenging you to think. Period.\nAnn Althouse said... I am challenging you to think more deeplyIn other words, read between the lines, because it might not be there when you read the article.\nReally, Professor? Have you ever been to the Puritan? Do you know anything about it? How it's laid out? She went into the main part. The Marine and his bride were in a private room quite a ways away. They came to greet her and ask her for pictures. Had she not taken the time to visit with them when they asked, what would the headlines read? Jesus fucking Christ on a fucking pogo stick. \"I'm challenging you to think more deeply.No, you're not. You're just being blonde and it's not attractive, not matter what Meade tells you.\nI am challenging you to think more deeply.The appearance of this sentence is always an infallible sign that Althouse has been caught in an error.\nPALIN CRASHES WEDDING!UPSTAGES BRIDE!OPENS HER GIFTS!SLEEPS WITH HER HUSBAND....developing....\n\"It makes the reception that much more memorable (in a good way) for the guests, which flatters the bride.\"Well, that's kind of my theory of weddings, which is why I didn't want one. If it's all about making the guests have a great time and not a boring time like all those other weddings... save your effort and money...I think people who put on weddings are thinking about making the bride a fabulous center of attention. If another woman upstages her... it's not what that was about.\nBTW:Ann Althouse said... “we’ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our wedding”. Is that the memory the woman was hoping to lock into her permanent memory? In the phrase \"It's her day,\" the \"her\" isn't supposed to be a politician that shows up for a photo op.*************It was, by the way and don't forget, the reception. They left their reception and asked Palin for pictures. Palin didn't crash the damn wedding demanding the focus be on her. Palin went to a fairly famous local eatery to get some of the fairly famous chicken fingers and chat with some locals. That's hardly showing up for a goddam photo op. Then, while she was waiting for her food, she was accosted by a young Marine and his wife all agog and agibber that Sarah Fucking Palin was there.Jesus.\n\"She went into the main part. The Marine and his bride were in a private room quite a ways away. They came to greet her and ask her for pictures.\"I'm picturing the guests getting wind of Sarah's presence and scampering away from the wedding to get a look. That's stage 1. The bride is upset by that and the people around her try to make the lemons into lemonade or whatever.\n\"Palin went to a fairly famous local eatery to get some of the fairly famous chicken fingers and chat with some locals.

I'm not saying Palin intended to crash the wedding, but that's the way it played out.\nrhhardin said... Limbaugh did that.Did what? Stand downstairs at the take out counter and be accosted by a Marine and a woman in a wedding dress? Not the same thing. Don't write it like it is.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) Let me just add for the progressives, “Quitter”, “Ditz”, “Unelectable” “Smurf-house Al-tards” Capishay? Oh and I liked the phrase \"Think more deeply\" and the retort...\"I made an error\".\n\"I'm picturing the guests getting wind of Sarah's presence and scampering away from the wedding to get a look. That's stage 1. The bride is upset by that and the people around her try to make the lemons into lemonade or whatever.\"I give up. She was probably pissed. So pissed I imagine it's a wonder she didn't ask her Marine husband to snap Palin's neck like a chicken finger.\nIf you cared to read the article, the bride and groom sought out Palin, to be photographed with her.She really sticks in your craw, eh?\nWhat proof do you have that it was obviously a photo op? A couple of days ago Palin wore dark glasses and an extra shirt and a hat pulled low to run a half marathon. It's not like she's some sort of messianic figure traveling across the country in a giant black armored bus with a 40 vehicle motorcade!Yes, she went there to get chicken and talk to people. But I don't believe she sent her advance people in to drag the Marine and his bride out to see her. I ask you again: have you ever been to the Puritan? The Marine and his bride had to actually leave their private room. It's not like they were just at a table in the back. Ask me how I know....\nThe only thing that could have upstaged that was to continue with honeymoon three-way.\nWILL SOMEONE TAKE THE SHOVEL OUT OF THE PROFESSOR'S HANDS BEFORE SHE STRIKES WATER AND FLOODS THE HOLE SHE'S DIGGING!\nI don't see how famous people can avoid all possible places where a wedding reception might be occurring. So you can't blame Palin for being near a wedding reception, or for the reaction of people at the venue.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) I will say that IF Palin gets in and gets the nod, Althouse will NOT be voting for her? Someone said it best, “She sticks your craw.” Palin just sticks in Althouse’s craw and so the Althouse demographic is a write-off for Palin in 2012, that’s for sure….Let’s try one more tack here, Althouse, IF the bride were upset, don’t you think she could have found a sympathetic blogger/journalist upon which she could unload her “ire?” After all it’s not like people who hate Palin aren’t a dime-a-dozen.\nAnnI think you've got this one wrong.\nShe showed up at an open restaurant for dinner, she wasn't at their wedding. They seemed to have come out to see her and been happy she was there. So I would say no. Not at all.\nYou got upstaged from that article?Seriously???\nPalin is upstaging everyone lately.The Bride had made plans for her reception. And the plans had to be adjusted on the spot.She was able to do the adult thing without pouting about changes made to her plan. Many people do that well.If she is married to a Marine, she had better get used to doing that.\nAgreed...and I'm sure she loved every minute of it.\nBREAKING !!!!Palin takes deep breath.Sucks air out of room.Women and children suffer most. Details at eleven.\n\"She was able to do the adult thing without pouting about changes made to her plan. Many people do that well.\"I lay a bet of a bottle of nice whiskey she had no urge to pout at all.\nIs that the memory the woman was hoping to lock into her permanent memory?There are a lot worse memories that happen at wedding receptions to lock into your memory. (Your bridesmaid or best man passing out or falling down drunk for one. Embarrassing fighting between the in-laws.)Perhaps they didn't vote for Obambi (unlike some people who refuse to admit that they made a terrible mistake) and they were THRILLED to see someone who represents their viewpoint and presents real hope for freedom and a change in our oppressive government. Or they were just happy to see a celebrity that they admire in their general vicinity.If Obama came to MY wedding, or any other event in my life, THAT would certainly be a horrific memory.It isn't like Palin said. \"Hey, here is a wedding. Let's crash it!!!\". It was more like. \"I'm getting something to eat and there happened to be a wedding nearby and they wanted me to take a photo with them. You betcha.\"\n\"As word of her appearance spread throughout the restaurant, a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures.\"I don't think she planned to crash the party. And, yes, if someone told her there was a reception going on, she could have left, but it doesn't sound as if that happened.Ann Althouse said...\"The couple seemed happy about it, so yes.\"Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?I'll bet the assembled press would have loved to hear the bride complain about the former Governor ruining her party.\nIf another woman upstages her... it's not what that was about.AHA!!! The crux of the matter. Fear of being upstaged by another woman.Get over yourself.\nI'll give you the benefit of the doubt, and presume that you were misled into \"thinking deeply\" by the term \"Back Room.\" Like CEO-MMP, I've actually been in that restaurant. It started out as an ice-cream & burgers place. After a while they added an enclosed seating area at the back of the place. This area, called the \"Back Room,\" is actually the place where the general public goes to sit down and eat. It is not a fancy place.It's clear from the article that there were lots of other people in the Back Room at the time, none of whom was there for the wedding. The Pappas Room is completely separate.Also, it's located on a major highway and has a large parking lot, so it provides easy in-and-out for someone who gets a craving for a snack in the middle of a busy day.School must have started up again. Your're \"thinking deeply\" like a silly academic instead of a hardheaded blogger.\nFamous people should just stay home. If we want to see them we can turn on the TV. Fame has lost them the right to come and go as they please.Or public places could have a neon sign in front, maybe a star inside a circle with a diagonal line across it. If anyone in the building is having a birthday, anniversary, wedding party, or any personal celebration, the sign would light up. This will let all the famous people know not to go in and upstage someone else's life.Maybe we could put all the famous people in cages like at the zoo. They need to learn their place.\nThe article could not be clearer: Palin went to a restaurant, had no reason to know there was a wedding going on in a private room, and responded graciously and appropriately when the bride and groom sought her out.Are your lame defenses of your original post in these comments are not up to your usual high standards. Please do the right thing and admit your dislike of Palin got the better of your judgment.\n\"Here's how Palin lost me, she crashed a wedding party once, and ruined two very nice people's lives for no reason at all, except to be mean.\" -- AA\nDidn't Palin also ruin a half-marathon for a bunch of people the other day by getting in front of them?Think about it. She's got all Alaska to run around in, plus Arizona. And yet she bigfooted some innocent Iowans. I'll bet they were pissed.What a bitch.\nThey look pretty happy about it and said as much...SarahPac\nPalin is the good fairy to Cinderella. Plays into wedding mythology. As she continually draws political strength from matrimonial bonds (ie \"never thought I'd want a divorce\" in Iowa). The wedding bit came alongside widespread video of her hugging a very effeminate man. Reconciliation.\nA lot of brides might fit the description you give of an immature, spoiled brat who wants all the attention on herself, no matter what. They're known around here as \"Bridezillas,\" and while I do think young girls are encouraged to think this way by the wedding industry, I don't think most fall into that trap, once they become women. Not the ones with any hope of having a lasting marriage, anyway.It also sounds to me like you might have a particular aversion to Bridezillas (hence your own low-key, deeply personal and private marriage). But you seem to assume Bridezillas are the norm rather the exception, and thus you are here both rejecting them, and accusing Sarah Palin (a political \"Bridezilla\" herself, perhaps?) of having the temerity to run afoul of one at the same time. Knocking down two distasteful female types at the same time: A two-fer! SCORE!I think I can see the connection; but I'm not buying it, based on the article, and the obvious delight of the bride. I think drawing the conclusion you do seems more snarky than insightful.\nThe best moment this bride had! Everyone who was there will remember this moment. Even better in that it seems so spontaneous.Don't see the down side. Think it's a treat. Let alone the picture! What bride wouldn't make that picture her very own best moment, too? (Not so much if it was obama showing up, though. Not with that crowd.)\n\"I did not misread the article. The things you're pointing out were completely taken into account. I am challenging you to think more deeply.\"Oh for fuck's sake Ann quit trying to OVERTHINK everything. The answer is staring you right in the face. If you didn't reside in academia you would be forced to jettison so much of what you imagine is \"deep thinking\" and cut to the chase. That is the same deep thinking that allows you to imagine Obama is normal but proves to a person with normally functioning cognitive facilities that you are a classic example of the over-educated fool.\nAlso, since pictures of the couple with Sarah Palin were probably photographed by SarahPac's wonderful official photographer, Shealah Craighead, I bet they get a nice autographed photo with a signed inscription by the Governor.Shealah Craighead\nIn the pix at that link, the Palins look better-dressed than most of the other guests at that wedding.What? That wasn't the wedding party? That was a bunch of men in shorts and the like chowing down at a casual-dining joint? You mean to say that the bride and groom just barged in there like they owned the place and demanded a photo op?I'd better think more deeply about this whole thing.\nAnn writes headlines to get us involved!She's like the referee in a soccer match who can use her hands to throw in the ball.Then we're left to look and lurk. Or to use words. And, not because we agree. But because we're human. And, opinions vary.\nIn the phrase \"It's her day,\" the \"her\" isn't supposed to be a politician that shows up for a photo op. When the happy couple invite family and friends to come celebrate with them, the family and friends are guests at the wedding. The bride and groom, in entertaining their guests, are to make it a great day for the guests. It is nice for guests to make it a great day for the bridal couple, but the onus is on the bride and groom to make it a great day for their guests. We need to get rid of the \"It's my/our day\" mentality. It makes for some really nasty wedding stories.I was happy when my neighbor--whom I did not expect to come--attending my wedding. His being there made my day, and still lights up my memories of that day.\nPalin enters restaurant...upstages waitressSingle mother...no healthcare...tips may have sufferedOrder Soup of the Day, Daily special Patty Melt upstaged, sales suffer..Think deeply what a horrible, horrible women she is....\nWaiting now for the \"You people just don't get my humor\" part of the thread.Should be arriving in about 15 more comments.\nOh, shame, Ann. It's not like she crashed the wedding. The Marine and his wife approached her, from what I read, and she 'put down her waffle,' so to speak, and obliged them. There's some as would have whined about it You angling for a media job?\nDon't see any upstaging.\nHe is a Marine, so of course they are thrilled. Palin respects our military and loves America, and I am sure this couple would prefer her to be his CIC than Obama who holds nothing but contempt for our armed services.\nThe bait seems to have been taken.\nI am challenging you to think more deeply.I think all of us did think \"more deeply\" about it. The consensus is that you're the one who's off base.Sorry about that.\nOK, I've thought more deeply about this. Althouse is right. Here's how this plays out:1. Palin enters restaurant for snack.2. Excitement spreads among crowd in state where it is well known she has no chance of winning primary. Obvious plants.3. Bride and groom leave their wedding reception to see what the hubbub's about. See Palin. Decide to cut their losses and score an autographed photo with her. These are quite rare, and likely to appreciate rapidly in value after she's trounced in the primaries.4. Ann Althouse, the famous blogger, is the only person in America to figure out what really happened. Everyone else is duped by the fake smiles of the newlyweds.5. Althouse's insight is picked up by not-so-famous bloggers Yglesias, Klein, etc.; spreads to MSM.6. Swarm of reporters descends upon newlyweds during their honeymoon in order to get the truth about this story.7. Media swarm ruins couple's honeymoon.See? Althouse is correct once again.\nDid they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?9/6/11 9:04 AM Ann Althouse said...I did not misread the article. The things you're pointing out were completely taken into account. I am challenging you to think more deeply.9/6/11 9:05 AMYeah Ann. You are thinking deeply...as in bottom dragging. How could the bride express displeasure? How about by opening her mouth and saying so? Did Sarah show up wearing a white gown or something? Yes you can be gracious and still express your feelings on your wedding day. My guess is Sarah Palin showing up at this wedding was like Johnny Fontaine showing up at the wedding in the Godfather. A coup for the bride, not an over shaddowing. Are you suggesting that if they were displeased, they would not have hesitated to say: \"Sarah Palin crashed our wedding!\" They sought her out and were thrilled by it (because they like Sarah Palin). Obviously if they did not like her, then things would have been different.\nThe bride looks thrilled! She could be faking it, but I doubt it--the kind of woman who would marry a Marine is the kind of woman who likes Sarah Palin.The groom looks a little nervous in the picture. Maybe he is wondering if he just met his next Commander in Chief .\nTo add insult to injury earlier that day Palin ran a half marathon in Iowa anonymously, finishing with a time of 1:46, second in her age group. She also ran faster than all the women in the age group below except one. She placed fifth overall among women of any age.\nAll this shows Ann is Sarah Palin can never win. She is always wrong. But ask yourself, if Barack and Michelle Obama showed up at that restaurant and the bride and groom did the same thing for them...would you have written the same post? My guess is you whould not have, but I am challenging you to think deeply.\nKurt Russell showed up when I was staying at Skydome once. Never thought I'd be upstaged by Snake Plissken but there it is.\nKurt Russell was the best man at my wedding. Actually he was not, but my best man did look sort of like Kurt Russell. Then he bedded two of the bridesmaids. And they knew about each other but both wanted him. He was coming off a divorce and feeling depressed so it perked him up. So he had a good time.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew)Then he bedded two of the bridesmaidsSimultaneously? IS there…video?Oh let me use the Garage, line, “Video, or it didn’t happen”\nGood gravy, you're serious about this, Althouse? Really?Palin probably just shouldn't leave her house anymore.\nMany brides do not have that good a time at the wedding. Too much stress to talk to everyone and few get ton enjoy the food. I always advise young ladies to elope and their moms get upset.\nAlso, are all brides completely self-obsessed narcissists, or is someone projecting a little here?I should think that a military bride, in particular, might be a bit more down-to-earth than your average Bridezilla.\nI think that Althouse is missing the big picture here.The real victim is Sheila Beermann, who drove all the way from Elk Point, SD to hopefully place first or second in the half marathon. Due to the unexpected entry of \"Sarah Heath\", poor sheila is relegated to a shameful third place in her age division.\nTypical Palin aggressive photo opp. ..Marines, new bride hottie, swank hotel. She should just stripped n pulled a 3way wit' the grunt and his new ho.\nAlso, I think the professor needs a new tag: \"Paving the way to vote for Obama again.\"\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) The Small Pathetic Voice chimes in to demonstrate why it is called the small pathetic voice…must be sad to have to come to a POPULAR blog to scream, “Look at me”.\nAh it's JoeJoe, the Small Pathetic Kissingerite. Dissent bothers you doesn't it little man. For that matter, you're too crass and irrational to understand satire. Palin's another flagwaver. Why, stand in front of harleys, with flags and marines/vets, a few hotties--and.... she's Prez material! Not. Then, that's a bit too profound for a little shyster like you to understand isn't it JoeJoe.\nOkay, I'm going to challenge the professor to think a little more deeply, too.How is a momentary photo-op able to upstage an entire wedding? How is it not still the bride's day? It's not like Palin got on the wedding table and did the watusi. She'll be in maybe one photo in the inevitable photo album, and it will be an interesting anecdote for the grandkids, nothing else.See, this is the kind of crazy Palin criticism that drives some of us up the wall.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) The Small Pathetic Voice might want to check out and see if anyone truly cares about its opinion…I believe its blog has NO comments (unless you count the ONE I randomly placed there), which would seem to imply that no one really cares what it thinks or says…I believe that is what drives the small voice to Althouse’s Big Front Porch so it can scream, “LOOK AT ME”\nAs a pastor who officiates many weddings I have to constantly work at not letting my charm and charisma take the spotlight off the bride on her special day. I know how Sarah must feel.\n.\"... I am challenging you to think more deeply...\"Methinks you're thinking too much into this.\n@Kensington, you're dead right. IMAO it isn't men who erected the glass ceiling. It was women stabbing other women in the back.\nAlthouse, dear, Go to the bathroom and purge. Quick! Quick! Quick! Get that kool-aid out of your system. I'm thinking deeply about this. I'm thinking ahead. Next thing to happen is that you and Palin will be standing in a garden. Palin will say, \"Let's find shelter. That looks like a nasty thundercloud heading our way.\"Althouse replies, \"Don't order me around! That's smoke from a forest fire you started.\"orA punk shoves Althouse off her bike and starts to peddle off. Palin, running the same path, tackles the thief. Althouse, laying there bleeding, screams, \"Palin, you attention hog! You knocked my water bottle out of its holder.\"Purge, Dear Althouse, purge!\nCaribou Barbie has been sent back to the Rancho de Klondike, at least virtually. The GOP pork-in-chief have given her the boot.\nI should think that a military bride, in particular, might be a bit more down-to-earth than your average Bridezilla. If I am understanding correctly from the locals and the pictures, they seem to have had their reception at some kind of chicken shack. So I don’t have her pegged as any kind of Bridezilla.\nShanna said \"...So I don’t have her pegged as any kind of Bridezilla.\"Exactly. This is kind of a weird post for this site, I think -- jr hi style sneering by the \"cool\" girl, nose held high -- and the target seems to be both traditional brides and Sarah Palin. Unless Althouse was just snickering to herself all the while she posted it, as Chip S. suggests. In which case, the target was us.This does not comfort me!\nEven if the bride were a self-absorbed twit she would have the satisfaction of knowing that it is unlikely that a famous person will show up at her friends' wedding receptions. (It's not about having the perfect wedding/reception, it's about having one that is better than your friends'.)When a friend or family member gets married, you know whose reception will get mentioned every time. It's almost as good as having your wedding dance video go viral.\nWhere's the picture? No link at the story.Truth be known, most receptions are nice but totally forgettable.\nOne of the most inane, catty, and asinine posts ever.\nAnd Professor -- you really have lost touch (I hope temporarily) with the real people.There are lots of real people out here who don't fake stuff and / or lie about everything.(PS - it was a wedding reception, not the \"wedding.\")\ntake the spotlight off the bride on her special daySo special when they've been shacking up for years and her virtue was gone long before that.And shouldn't it be \"their day\", or are women so insecure they think ensnaring a man makes them special?\n\"Think more deeply\" = come up with a plausible scenario where it would be true that the bride was upstaged.So:The news spreads throughout the restaurant that Palin is there. The marine groom hears and is all \"Oh boy, let's go meet her and get a picture!!\" The bride is feeling pretty miffed that her new husband is even able to THINK about another woman during their wedding reception. Recognizing that it would be counterproductive to make a scene just then, she deploys the same social expertise which got her to the altar in the first place and \"enthusiastically\" agrees. The poor groom won't find out how badly he screwed up until he is reminded on their first anniversary, and second, and third ....\nShanna: they seem to have had their reception at some kind of chicken shackThanks to Google and Google Maps, you can see what this place looks like for yourself. And while I am a fan of church basement receptions, I'd say that this place looks like a proper place for a wedding reception. (And you can have the wedding there, too.) Hardly a \"chicken shack\" by any stretch of the imagination.\nFact is, Althouse lost all credibility when it comes to Palin.Don't bother to post anything more about her-If you need to know what Althouse's take on anything Palin is in the future, tune into Rachael Maddow.This is quite troublesome-\nRAF..apparently 'think more deeply' means 'recaitulate stock plot from failed ABC sitcom...'\nThanks for the link Peter, it looks like the kind of place we would like and Manchester NH is only about 20 minutes North of here.\nAnn, come on, all your 'picturings' would be thrown out of any court as assuming facts not in evidence, let alone a John Edwards level of channeling. We get you don't like Palin but we can watch Bill Maherfor this...\n@Richard Mcenroe: So I probably should have scattered some LOLs throughout for the laugh track?wv, I kid you not: chunt. Absolutely no comment, at all, ever!\n\"think more deeply\"??Sorry, perfesser, but sometimes a cigar is simply a cigar...\nAlways the Bride of Wackedenstein, never a Bride. Poor Saraw\nSomeday the history of how and why the Republican Party, once the party of sane fiscal policy and non intervention, decided to tack to the far right and become the party of the wacko, will be written and I am sure a whole chapter will be devoted to the fascination so many have for this no talent, intellectually challenged, loud mouthed whack job. I know she drives the Left nuts, because even they are amazed that anyone, even on the Right, would take her seriously but really? This idiot? LOL Good luck running her for anything folks.\nFriend of mine was at a wedding when Meir Kahane showed up, with bodyguards. Says he went to a lot of effort to remain unnoticed.\nPragmatist wrote: \"...the fascination so many have for this no talent, intellectually challenged, loud mouthed whack job.

They are the dumb people like Sarah Palin actually believe in the future of the USA and will fight for it.Will she give up? I doubt it.She is the dumb Scots-Irish redneck of her day similar to Andrew Jackson who was the dumb redneck of 1828.\nI am challenging you to think more deeply.So if I don't agree with you, I'm not thinking deeply enough?That's pretty arrogant, Althouse.The title of your post is not justified by anything at all in the article. This is NYT- or AP- level dishonesty.The fact that most of us disagree with you doesn't necessarily make us right. At the same time, \"If everyone around you says you're drunk, you should sit down.\"\nObviously @Althouse has bought into the Bridezilla reality tv show version of the wedding and the brides out of control narcissim that reflects today's society.Personally, I'm hoping we're raising young women that have a better sense of themselves and what makes their marriage commitment significant beyond a surprise celebrity/politician showing up, the most expensive dress or food. The young women I'm talking about are cut from Sarah Palin's cloth, they are the highest number of women in congress today and they define themselves outside of the box. I've had the pleasure of spending some very brief time with Sarah Palin and seeing her in person reacting to those around her. She would be the first person to embrace that young bride and lift her up...not being of the progressive left's eat our own sister variety. Sarah is secure in herself and she passes that on to everyone around her. That's why so many common folk love her...she's not put herself on a pedastal.\nHardly a \"chicken shack\" by any stretch of the imagination. Somebody above said they were known for their chicken fingers and you have to admit the Palin pictures did not showcase a fancy venue.\nraf -- and maybe make the husband a fat lout who's always wrong...\nI haven't seen a shellacking like this bad since I tried to refinish the dining room table.\nIt sounds like Palin was in the public area and the wedding party had their reception in a separate area and they came out to see her when they heard she was there.I'm not sure \"upstages\" really applies, at least not the part that suggests bad manners.\nI am outraged by Palin's rude behavior and have decided to vote the straight Democratic ticket next year in retaliation.\nAnne, did you hit your again like when you voted for the Empty Suit?The article stated she came for the chicken fingers and they were in a different room.So showing up for chicken fingers at a restaurant is now somehow showing up a bride?Has the Palin hysteria gotten to you too?\nAlthouse, you can be obtuse often but this is just idiocy.\nSo how about it, Althouse? How good are you with, \"Maybe I did go overboard there\"? Humility is an attractive trait. Sarah knows this.\nAs word of her appearance spread throughout the restaurant, a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures. The newlyweds now had another reason to grin from ear to ear as they were overheard saying “we’ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our wedding”.Looks like they came to her and asked to get some pictures.\nprairie wind said... So how about it, Althouse? How good are you with, \"Maybe I did go overboard there\"? Humility is an attractive trait.Not a chance.\nAllen is right, and it's a credibility hit for our host.

{"text": "Israel (מדינת ישראל) is a small yet diverse Middle Eastern country with a long coastline on the eastern Mediterranean Sea and a small window on the Red Sea at the Gulf of Eilat (Aqaba).\nIsrael was established as a state for the the Jewish people, following the Second World War. Israel is considered part of the Holy Land (together with areas of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Territories). The three major monotheistic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—all have historical ties to the region. Israel thus contains a vibrant modern history and culture, based in part on the diverse, immigrant origins of its inhabitants returning from the Jewish Diaspora. These aspects make Israel a fascinating destination for many travellers and pilgrims.\nFor Singaporeans, many of us have a warped perception of Israel as a dangerous place to visit because of the frequent news reports of conflicts in the Middle East. When I told my friends and family that I was travelling to Israel, the most common comment I get from those who have not been there is that I should be very careful for my safety.\nThe worries are unnecessary.\nI had a great one week stay at Israel, thanks to the wonderful team from Dig Israel who hosted me there. For the uninformed, Israel is a safe place to visit (excluding the West Bank and Gaza Strip which are not tourist destinations). It is like many other cosmopolitan cities around the world, but with it’s own quirk, diverse culture and people. I will share more about my Israel trip in my subsequent blog posts.\nThis post is to share some travel tips for Singaporeans who are planning to visit Israel on your own without going through a package tour:\n1. Israeli currency – New Israel Shekel\nThis currency is not easily available outside of Israel, but fret not, you can go to any money changer in Israel to do the exchange. There are counters available at the airport too, but the service fee or “commission” they charged are quite steep (about S$10+ depending on how much you change). The fee varies from one money changer to another, hence get a few quotes before settling on one to change. The fee charged is a flat fee, hence try to change as much currency as you need just once.\n2. Singaporean Passport\nIf you are holding a Malaysian passport, sorry, you cannot enter Israel. For Singapore passport holders, we do not require a visa. However, request for the Israeli custom officers to stamp on a special piece of immigration paper available at Israel airport instead of stamping directly on your passport. This is because an Israel passport chop may cause difficulties getting into and/or be refused visas to Islamic countries, such as Bangladesh, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan for your subsequent travels.\n3. Clearing Israel Custom\nThe security check is really tight when travelling to Israel. I find it fair enough as it is for our own safety too. You will be asked some profiling questions at the luggage check-in counter travelling to and from Israel. Some of the questions may get a little personal – eg. I was asked questions like why did I only took leave from work one week before my trip; asked to recount my day by day itinerary during my stay in Israel; went through some of my personal photos in my digital camera to check if what I said about my itinerary was true; reasons why I travelled to Malaysia since I been there twice this year and also whether I know anyone there. The questioning may take quite a while and will make some people uncomfortable. My advice is just to answer as honestly as possible if you have nothing to hide. Do not lie to speed up the questioning as they are very thorough and you may end up having to tell another lie to cover a previous harmless lie, increasing the chance of being exposed as a liar and getting detained. You will get to fly. Be patient.\nDo not take stuff like soil from Jerusalem and salt from the Dead Sea to pack home on your own. All baggage going out of Israel are screened and opened up for checking. Do not pull stunts like these. Do not take photographs of the security counter and officers either.\nThe ultra-orthodox Jews are easily identifiable with their curly side burns, black suits and tassels. Tourists like to take pictures of them because of their interesting appearance which we are not familiar with. However, do bear in mind that they are not animals in the zoo and as much as you would get pissed off with strangers taking random pictures of you, they feel the same way too. Do accord them due respect and try not intrude in their personal space.\n6. The Sabbath\nBe aware of the Sabbath: from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown, train and bus services are not available in Israel (except in Haifa, Nazareth and Eilat, and limited sherut services – shared taxis). Unless you have a car, or are willing to pay for a taxi (not shared), if you’re day tripping on a Friday, you should start thinking about how to get back by noon at the latest, and you should plan on staying near your lodgings on Saturday. Attractions, shops and malls are also closed during the Sabbath. I made the mistake of staying for an additional day in Tel Aviv during the Sabbath and ended up wandering the streets alone with nothing to see or do. I also had to specially advance book a taxi to the airport.\n7. Gay and Lesbian Travel\nIsrael is one of the most “gay friendly” countries in the world. Seriously. All three major cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa) have an annual “Pride” parade, and the annual Love Parade in Tel Aviv gets cheering spectators too. Look out for many hotels, cafes and restaurants with rainbow flags hanging outside. These are all gay-friendly places.\nIsrael is not a cheap country. I find it more expensive than Sydney and the United States in terms of food, lodging and shopping. On average, a meal cost around S$20 for a simple meal at a cafe. A bottle of 500ml water cost around S$5. Taxi from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv one way cost about S$100.\nStreet food is safe and clean. Israeli cuisine is as diverse as the population which makes up this gastronomic country. Food in Israel is generally of a very high standard. I really enjoyed the food during my stay. Not tipping in sit-in restaurants that have waiters is frowned upon, but is accepted for signalling atrocious service. It is standard to give 10%-15% (or more for exceptional service). 20% tip is considered generous.\nHebrew and Arabic are the official languages of Israel. Hebrew is most commonly spoken. 20% of the population are Israeli-Arabs who speak Arabic as well. English is the most popular foreign language.

{"text": "Nuclear Energy in France\nNuclear energy is the cornerstone of french energy policy. In the ‘70s France chose to develop nuclear as its base load electricity source as a response to the oil crisis and assure its energy independence.\nNuclear Electricity Production: France currently counts 58 commercial nuclear reactors in operation responsible for producing 80% of French domestic electricity. As a comparison, the 104 US reactors produces 20% of US electricity.Despite scarce natural resources, France has reached an energy independence of 50% thanks to its strategic choice for nuclear energy.\nEnvironment: As well as providing safe and reliable energy, nuclear helps to reduce French greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the release of 31 billions tones of carbon dioxide (contrary to coal or gas generation) and making France the less carbon emitting country within the OECD. As a leader in nuclear energy, France has developed clean technology for radioactive waste disposal. Reprocessing currently allows France to recover valuable elements from spent fuels and permit a significant reduction of high level waste and lead to safer and optimized containment, for final radioactive waste disposition. French nuclear power plants produces only 10 g/year/inhabitant of highly radioactive waste.\nInternational Cooperation and research: France is one of the forerunner in nuclear research and participates in numerous international cooperation programs alongside the United States such as the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants (Gen IV) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) that will be built in Cadarache, South of France.\nThe French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)\nThe French Atomic Energy Commission is a public body established in October 1945 by General de Gaulle. It constitutes a power of expertise and proposition for the authorities. A leader in research, development and innovation, the CEA is involved in three main fields:\nIt develops and acquires the technological building blocks necessary to the development of the nuclear reactors of the future (Contribution to Generation IV and GNEP research),\nIt contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emission with its research on hydrogen, fuel cells, biomass, energy storage…,\nIt supports the nuclear utilities in France by optimizing the nuclear power plants of the French nuclear fleet and by optimizing the fuel cycle,\nIt offers safe and economically viable technical solutions for managing nuclear waste,\nIt conducts fundamental research in climate and environmental sciences, high energy physics, astrophysics, fusion, nanosciences…\nInformation and Health technologies:\nIt tackles micro and nano-technologies for telecommunication and nuclear medicine for radiotherapy and medical imaging,\nIt researches programs on biotechnology, molecular labelling, biomolecular engineering and structural biology,\nIt shares its knowledge and know-how through education and training through the National Institute for Nuclear Sciences and Technologies (INSTN),\nIt manages over 300 priority patents and is active in the creation of clusters.\nDefense and National Security:\nIt conceives, builds, maintains then dismantles the nuclear warhead of the French deterrence force,\nIt helps to fight against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons (NRBC program).\nThe missions of the CEA are similar to the Department of Energy in the United States. The CEA has a network of counselor or representatives in French Embassies around the world (see joint map).\nThe French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN)\nCreated in 2006, from the former DSIN (Directorate for the Safety of Nuclear Facilities), the French Nuclear Safety Authority is an independent administrative authority which is tasked with regulating nuclear safety and radiation protection in order to protect workers, patients, the public and the environment from the risks involved in nuclear activities. It also contributes to informing the public. Like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, it carries out inspections and may pronounce sanctions, up to and including suspension of operation of an installation.\nFrench Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)\nCreated in 2001 by merging the Protection and Nuclear Safety Institute (IPSN) and the Ionizing radiations Protection Office (OPRI), the Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety is a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature placed under the joint authority of the Ministries of the Environment, Health, Industry, Research and Defense. It is the expert in safety research and specialized assessments into nuclear and radiological risk serving public authorities whose work is complementary to the ASN.\nIts scope of activities includes:\nenvironment and response,\nhuman radiological protection,\nresearch on the prevention of major accidents,\npower reactor safety,\nfuel cycle facility safety,\nresearch installation safety,\nwaste management safety;\nnuclear defense expertise.\nNational radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA)\nCreated in 1991, the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management is a public industrial and commercial organization that operates independently of waste producers. It is responsible for the long-term management of radioactive waste produced in France under the supervision of the French Ministries for Energy, Research and the Environment. It can be compared to a certain extent to the Office for Nuclear Waste of the Department of Energy in the United States.\nAndra also pursues industrial, research, and information activities as it designs and implements disposal solutions suited to each category of radioactive waste:\nthe collection, conditioning, disposal of radioactive waste from small producers (hospitals, research centers, industry),\nspecification of waste packages for disposal,\ndisposal in suited sites,\nmonitoring of closed disposal facilities,\nresearch programs for long-lived and high level activity waste, especially through the operation of an underground research laboratory in a deep clay formation…\nGeneral Directorate for Energy and Climate (DGEC)\nThe General Directorate for Energy and Climate represents the government and is part of the Office of the Department for Ecology and Sustainable Development. It defines the French nuclear policy. The DGEC takes care of the energy supply, the security of supply, oil refining and logistics, nuclear industry, and coal and mines.\nConsequently, its activities include:\nthe design and implement energy and raw material supply policy,\nto ensure opening of electricity and gas markets,\ntrack key energy and raw material sectors,\nto oversee enterprises and public institutions in energy sector,\nto ensure compliance with rules and regulations governing energy sector,\nto participate in European and international energy projects and working groups,\nto provide economic, environmental, and fiscal expertise on energy matters.\nThe Rise of Nuclear Power Generation in France.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f5c220a7-7276-4cf2-9208-33679d478b1f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article949&xtor=AL-13", "date": "2013-05-18T06:33:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9123350381851196, "token_count": 1305, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Mexican America - Introduction\n\"Mexican America\" is a sampling of objects from the collections of the National Museum of American History. The stories behind these objects reflect the history of the Mexican presence in the United States. They illustrate a fundamentally American story about the centuries-old encounter between distinct (yet sometimes overlapping) communities that have coexisted but also clashed over land, culture, and livelihood.\nWho, where, and what is Mexico? Over time, the definitions and boundaries of Mexico have changed. The Aztec Empire and the area where Náhautl was spoken—today the region surrounding modern Mexico City—was known as Mexico. For 300 years, the Spanish colonizers renamed it New Spain.\nWhen Mexico was reborn in 1821 as a sovereign nation, its borders stretched from California to Guatemala. It was a huge and ancient land of ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse regions that struggled for national unity. Texas, (then part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas) was a frontier region far from the dense cities and fertile valleys of central Mexico, a place where immigrants were recruited from the United States. The immigrants in turn declared the Mexican territory an independent republic in 1836 (later a U.S. state), making the state the first cauldron of Mexican American culture. By 1853, the government of Mexico, the weaker neighbor of an expansionist United States, had lost what are today the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. In spite of the imposition of a new border, the historical and living presence of Spaniards, Mexicans, indigenous peoples, and their mixed descendants remained a defining force in the creation of the American West.\n“La América Mexicana” es una muestra conformada por objetos provenientes de las distintas colecciones del Museo Nacional de Historia Americana. Estos objetos reflejan la historia de la presencia mexicana en los Estados Unidos e ilustran una crónica fundamentalmente americana acerca del encuentro centenario entre comunidades diferentes que han coexistido, pero que también se han enfrentado, en la pugna por la tierra, la cultura y el sustento.\n¿Quién, dónde y qué es México? Con el transcurso del tiempo, las definiciones y los límites de México han ido cambiando. Se conocía como México al Imperio Azteca y toda el área donde se hablaba náhuatl —actualmente la región circundante a la ciudad de México. Durante 300 años los colonizadores españoles se refirieron a ella como Nueva España. Cuando en 1821 México resurgió como una nación soberana, sus fronteras se extendían desde California a Guatemala. En ese entonces era un antiguo e inmenso territorio conformado por regiones étnica, lingüística y económicamente diversas que luchaban por adquirir unidad nacional. Texas (en ese entonces parte de los estados mexicanos de Coahuila y Tejas) era una región fronteriza lejos de las densas urbes y de los fértiles valles de México central, donde se reclutaban inmigrantes de los Estados Unidos. En el año 1836 este territorio mexicano se declaró como república independiente (y más tarde, estado de EE.UU.), convirtiéndose en el primer calderón de la cultura mexicoamericana. Hacia 1853, el gobierno de México, el vecino débil de un Estados Unidos en expansión, había perdido el territorio de los actuales estados de California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas y partes de Colorado y Wyoming. A pesar de la imposición de un nuevo límite fronterizo, la presencia histórica y ocupacional de los españoles, mexicanos y pueblos indígenas, junto a sus descendientes mestizos, constituiría a lo largo del tiempo una influencia determinante para el desarrollo del Oeste Americano.\n\"Mexican America - Introduction\" showing 1 items.\n- This print depicts American forces attacking the fortress palace of Chapultepec on Sept. 13th, 1847. General Winfield Scott, in the lower left on a white horse, led the southern division of the U.S. Army that successfully captured Mexico City during the Mexican American War. The outcome of American victory was the loss of Mexico's northern territories, from California to New Mexico, by the terms set in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. It should be noted that the two countries ratified different versions of the same peace treaty, with the United States ultimately eliminating provisions for honoring the land titles of its newly absorbed Mexican citizens. Despite notable opposition to the war from Americans like Abraham Lincoln, John Quincy Adams, and Henry David Thoreau, the Mexican-American War proved hugely popular. The United States' victory boosted American patriotism and the country's belief in Manifest Destiny.\n- This large chromolithograph was first distributed in 1848 by Nathaniel Currier of Currier and Ives, who served as the \"sole agent.\" The lithographers, Sarony & Major of New York (1846-1857) copied it from a painting by \"Walker.\" Unfortunately, the current location of original painting is unknown, however, when the print was made the original painting was owned by a Captain B. S. Roberts of the Mounted Rifles. The original artist has previously been attributed to William Aiken Walker as well as to Henry A. Walke. William Aiken Walker (ca 1838-1921) of Charleston did indeed do work for Currier and Ives, though not until the 1880's and he would have only have been only 10 years old when this print was copyrighted. Henry Walke (1808/9-1896) was a naval combat artist during the Mexican American War who also worked with Sarony & Major and is best known for his Naval Portfolio.\n- Most likely the original painting was done by James Walker (1819-1889) who created the \"Battle of Chapultepec\" 1857-1862 for the U.S. Capitol. This image differs from the painting commissioned for the U. S. Capitol by depicting the troops in regimented battle lines with General Scott in a more prominent position in the foreground. James Walker was living in Mexico City at the outbreak of the Mexican War and joined the American forces as an interpreter. He was attached to General Worth's staff and was present at the battles of Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. The original painting's owner, Captain Roberts was assigned General Winfield Scott to assist Walker with recreating the details of the battle of Chapultepec. When the painting was complete, Roberts purchased the painting. By 1848, James Walker had returned to New York and had a studio in New York City in the same neighborhood as the print's distributor Nathaniel Currier as well as the lithographer's Napoleon Sarony and Henry B. Major.\n- This popular lithograph was one of several published to visually document the war while engaging the imagination of the public. Created prior to photography, these prints were meant to inform the public, while generally eliminating the portrayal of the more gory details. Historians have been able to use at least some prints of the Mexican War for study and to corroborate with the traditional literary forms of documentation. As an eyewitness, Walker could claim accuracy of detail within the narrative in his painting. The battle is presented in the grand, historic, heroic style with the brutality of war not portrayed. The print depiction is quite large for a chromo of the period. In creating the chromolithographic interpretation of the painting, Sarony & Major used at least four large stones to produce the print \"in colours,\" making the most of their use of color. They also defined each figure with precision by outlining each in black. This print was considered by expert/collector Harry T. Peters as one of the finest ever produced by Sarony & Major.\n- Currently not on view\n- Date made\n- associated date\n- Currier, Nathaniel\n- Scott, Winfield\n- Sarony & Major\n- Walker, James\n- ID Number\n- catalog number\n- accession number\n- Data Source\n- National Museum of American History, Kenneth E.

{"text": "American Printer's mission is to be the most reliable and authoritative source of information on integrating tomorrow's technology with today's management.\nJul 1, 2006 12:00 AM\nFollowing the recent release of QuarkXPress 7, graphic arts managers and other technology decisionmakers are asking two primary questions:\nQuark has revamped its previously troubled color management system with some success. There are four fundamental changes:\nCommand central for QuarkXPress 7’s color management is\nthe Color Manager, located in Preferences. Whether it is good to\nalways have color management on can (and will be) argued both ways.\nFor savvy production color users, it’s probably a good thing,\nas ultimately it forces us to make color decisions that we should\nbe making anyway. For those with limited color experience, the\nquality and consequences of the QuarkXPress 7 default settings will\ndetermine the output results. Learn how to config-ure the source\nand output settings (Edit menu) and apply them through the Color\nManager (Preferences) and/or the Job Jackets Manager (more on this\nThe source/output setting separation is a welcome change. Users can control specifically which color profiles and rendering intents will be used for viewing and converting the color in your images. For many this will involve using the same profiles and intents used elsewhere, such as in Adobe Photoshop. You also have access to the same color system-stored profiles as those accessed in Photoshop, as well as the Quark-specific profiles stored in Quark’s application folder. If you pay attention, you should be able to keep your color consistent as you move your images through QuarkXPress.\nFor those of you anxiously wondering about using your previous color settings that you know how to print, breathe easy. You can select QuarkXPress Emulate Legacy for your source and Output settings, and ColorSync or ICM for your color management module (CMM), if you want to just pass the old values through. The most obvious opening for color divergence is if you convert colors through QuarkXPress using a CMM different than one you use elsewhere.\nThe third major color management change is Quark’s\nadoption of LogoSync CMM. The CMM is the engine that actually\nhandles the conversion of the color values from one color profile\nspace to another color profile space. Using LogoSync is an overall\nimprovement, but it has built-in limitations, as well. Switching\nfrom OS-based ColorSync or ICM to LogoSync (for the default CMM) is\na good move for two reasons. First, using LogoSync provides more\ncross-platform compatibility not available when ColorSync was used\non the Mac. Second, ICM is used in Windows. The limitations of both\nColorSync and ICM are widely acknowledged, so other CMMs have been\nadopted widely. LogoSync (developed with GretagMacbeth) is an\nacknowledged high quality CMM. The inherent limitation of using\nLogoSync is that it currently is not widely used. In print\nproduction the most widely used CMM is the Adobe (ACE) CMM. There\nare those who argue LogoSync is a better CMM than Adobe (ACE) CMM.\nEven if this is true, it is largely irrelevant to the discussion of\nconsistency. And there is little Quark can do about this, as it\ndoes not have access to the Adobe (ACE) CMM. So until either Adobe\nreleases its Adobe (ACE) CMM for third-party use or another CMM\n(such as LogoSync) becomes the commonly used standard, this\ninconsistency in color conversion will exist. How visible the\ndifferences in the conversion results will be will depend upon the\nimages, color profiles and rendering intents used.\nBypass color conversion problems by performing the conversions in another application (such as Adobe Photoshop) and assigning the same color profiles for Source and Output in QuarkXPress that you have in Photoshop.\nThe other major change—a good oneis the ability to soft proof nondestructively using color profiles and rendering intents. Quark’s soft proofing is similar to InDesign’s soft proofing with a View menu Output Control. Also like InDesign, QuarkXPress now lets users view and change image-specific color profile and rendering intent via Window > Profile information.\nSo what’s the bottom line? Here are my conclusions:\nOne caveat: This .psd import capability doesn’t seem to work well with layers modified by Photoshop CS2 Layer Styles. When I imported a CS2 .psd image containing layer styles, I consistently received an error message indicating that layer effects were not supported. But when this occurred, the .psd image still was imported and access and editing still was provided to those layers and channel components that were supported. (Perhaps the PSD Import feature was developed and tested with CS1 images.)\nPicture effects provide for a variety of picture editing tools, including curves, sharpening, blurring and many more. Once applied, these effects adjustments can be stored and reused. I remain a staunch supporter of making these corrections directly in an image editing application such as Photoshop. Nonetheless, this could be a time-saving production tool when working with client files whose images all need the same amount of lightening or sharpening. You could apply the effect once, record that adjustment and then apply it to as many other images as are required.\nYou even can share picture effects files. InDesign does not offer a similaralry powerful image-editing tool. Picture Effects currently does not work with Photoshop images, a frustrating mismatch with the .psd import function.\nKeyboard shortcuts are a mixed bag. QuarkXPress historically has provided the more logical and elegant keyboard shortcut sets and sequences. Its use of the “M” series as well as its control of type size, tracking, kerning and leading still is the best around. But InDesign now offers a custom dialog (Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts) that allows you to assign your own keyboard shortcuts, reassign others, create sets of shortcuts and even use QuarkXPress and PageMaker shortcuts. Quark still has the fundamentally superior set of shortcuts, but it is resting on its laurels. InDesign offers an increasing number of shortcuts common to multiple CS applications, so it’s a tie in this category.\nMeasurements palette vs. control palette\nThe enhanced measurements palette is the most immediately obvious interface change in QuarkXPress 7. It has a new context-sensitive pop-up subpalette that offers many of the control features previously found only in other dialogs and palettes.\nThis is Quark’s answer to InDesign’s multifaceted control palettes.The new measurement palette is well designed and easier to decipher than InDesign’s implementation of a context-sensitive palette. If you just don’t like any of this context-sensitive sophistication, click on the Quark logo icon on the far left of the pop-up palette, and you will see your familiar old measurement palette.\nMaster pages, style sheets, text import and\nNo important changes have been made to master pages or style sheets in version 7. InDesign remains master of those realms.\nIn addition, InDesign offers multiple baseline grids (through text frame baselines) and boasts a complete and sophisticated Word document import feature for controlling the import, autoformatting and appending of style sheets from Word and .rtf documents, which QuarkXPress still lacks.\nOutput styles vs. print presets\nQuark has one-upped Adobe in the print styles category, where Quark’s print style was roughly equivalent to InDesign’s Print Presets. QuarkXPress’ new output style (Edit > Output Styles) is like print styles on steroids—it includes resolution-specific transparency flattening, metadata and JDF info, as well as standard print dialog settings.\nOutput styles have three initial default setups for PDF, Print and EPS (whose settings now include the ability to embed font files in EPS files). Output styles can be shared and are integrated into the powerful job jackets function, as well.\nQuarkXPress 7 has stuck with JAWS as its PDF Export function. While Quark has done extensive testing with the new and improved version of JAWS, I remain unconvinced of the consistent usability of JAWS-generated PDFs in prepress. (Besides, it is slower than molasses flowing in January.) I still recommend printing PostScript from QuarkXPress to Distiller-watched folders for generating prepress-bound PDFs. Again Adobe has an inherent advantage, because it owns PDF and Distiller. Quark does provide an easy and Preference-selectable avenue to PostScript and Distiller.\nOne of Quark’s most comprehensive and sophisticated new production tools is the implementation of job jackets, including the Job Jackets Manager (Utilities > Job Jackets Manager). Job jackets are complete descriptions of all—and I mean ALL—the characteristics of a job. Jobs can be defined at three levels:\nOnce defined, job jackets can be used in multiple ways. A job\njacket can be used to create a new job using all the predefined\ncharacteristics of that job jacket (File > New > Project From\nTicket). Job jackets also can be used to evaluate an existing job\n(File > Job Jacket > Evaluate Layout). This job evaluation\namounts to a sophisticated preflighting tool that allows you to\nlook for a wide range of intimate project and component\ncharacteristics, such as image resolution, file format, image color\nspace and attached color profiles. QuarkXPress documents also can\nbe output using job jackets or tickets. Instead of selecting File\n> Print, you can choose to define and control your output via\nthe job jacket by selecting File > Output Job, selecting a\nspecific set of output specifications defined in a ticket template,\nincluding previously created output styles. InDesign doesn’t\noffer this powerful production tool.\nNow for a reality check: The good news is that the job jacket function is robust, full-featured and highly integrated into QuarkXPress 7; the bad news is that the job jacket function has a complex and somewhat quirky (non-QuarkXPress-like) interface that is difficult to learn. I see this function initially being configured by print shop techies who will then train larger clients to use them.\nThe bottom line\nIf you are a QuarkXPress user, I think you will be delighted with version 7 and I recommend upgrading. Keep a copy of 6.5 available, too. I also recommend installing QuarkXPress 7 first on a test system partition or drive identical to your working system, as a precaution, to ensure the installation process does not cause any unexpected system problems. The bottom line: QuarkXPress 7 is a welcome update with some very powerful new tools and features.\nTalk to the hand\nWhenever I am working in QuarkXPress, I love that I don’t have to remember which of the two keyboard shortcuts I am supposed to use (depending upon whether I am working with an active text tool or not) for accessing the hand tool.\nIf I were king of Adobe, that is the first thing I would fix: One keyboard shortcut for accessing the hand tool! Then, while I was at it, I would change the names of the two selection tools to “object” and “content” tools.\nSo long to PostScript?\nBy Julie Shaffer\nThe Adobe PDF Print Engine is a new printing platform (a.k.a. RIP) that directly renders PDF files. Many print/prepress workflow solutions on the market today are based on Adobe CPSI RIP technology, which is built on PostScript. Even solutions that use PDF as an internal working file format, such as Kodak Prinergy, Agfa Apogee and Heidelberg PrintReady, still convert those PDF files to PostScript prior to actual imaging.\nBut PostScript 3 was introduced in 1997. It can’t natively render some newer effects, like transparency, which have become design mainstays. Transparency has to be flattened prior to introducing it to PostScript and, depending on how and where this flattening is done, the results can look terrible. Adobe’s PDF Print Engine eliminates all such problems because it renders those PDF files natively.\nThe technology also incorporates JDF information for job control, so it will fit nicely into the “end-to-end” workflow solutions.\nAdobe still will support PostScript—it won’t suddenly vanish. But the next evolution is here.\nFor further reading\nJay Nelson offers an excellent comprehensive review of QuarkXPress 7’s new features at: www.creative pro.com:80/story/review/24327.html?origin=story.\nTaz Tally is a digital imaging author, speaker and photographer.

{"text": "Few things have been more poorly understood about the Obama administration than its foreign policy. Partisan and ideological blinders have tended to obscure and distort how critics and supporters have interpreted his policy decisions and his reactions to events around the world. More hawkish interventionists have fixated on Obama’s diplomatic overtures to authoritarian states, his condemnation of Manuel Zelaya’s deposition, and his slightly firmer line on Israeli settlements as proof of weakness and perfidy, while realists and liberals have great confidence that the same represents a significant positive departure from past policy, but both are finding more in these moves than is really there. This has led to a number of misconceptions about how to classify the Obama administration’s foreign policy inclinations, and it has created confusion in how we should judge the administration’s performance in improving relations with much of the rest of the world.\nWhat continues to confuse observers on both sides is the remarkable—or perhaps depressing—continuity between the Obama and Bush administrations in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, which is usually acknowledged only when it suits the rhetorical purposes of an argument. Critics and supporters alike would rather emphasize a dialectical relationship between the two administrations in which Obama is the antithesis of Bush for good or ill, which permits discredited neoconservative interventionists to describe any Obama failures as the repudiation of realism, their traditional bête noire, and allows realists and liberals to rediscover the virtues of U.S. hegemony by confusing change in management with change in policy.\nThis continuity necessarily thwarts any attempt to find a consistent theme or pattern to the administration’s actions, and it renders criticisms of a lack of consistency moot. That has not stopped critics from trying to find grand, unifying explanations of Obama’s actions, such as perceiving a “pro-dictator,” “anti-democratic,” or “anti-American” pattern in Obama’s responses to the Honduran constitutional crisis and Iranian elections, but these are unsupported claims. No administration will ever pursue any policy with anything like perfect consistency, and Obama’s predecessor was no exception, so we should expect the same consistency or lack thereof from an administration that has largely followed in its predecessor’s footsteps. Indeed, the difficulty of pursuing a policy consistently draws more attention to the flaws of the policy than to an undesirable lack of consistency.\nNo matter how idealistic and ideological an administration may be, there are structures and interests that limit how any administration can act: Every ‘freedom agenda’ must have its exceptions for Arab dictators and anti-Russian demagogues, every non-proliferation regime must have its exceptions for allied nuclear states outside of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and every ‘war on terror’ must make room for or at least overlook the sponsorship of terrorism by allied governments. For that matter, there may also be longtime allies that find themselves at odds with major multilateral organizations, as the Honduran transitional government recently has, in which case Washington may end up siding with the latter as part of its regional or global “leadership” role. So a lack of consistency in administration policy by itself is neither praiseworthy nor damning—it is what the reality of international affairs imposes on even the most zealous ideologue.\nInasmuch as Wilsonian idealism has permeated both parties especially since the end of the Cold War, the criticisms that partisan opponents level at a given administration will typically be framed in terms of the administration’s failures or disinterest in promoting democracy, and the administration’s defenders will stress its overriding democratist goals. Once again, we have debates over means rather than ends. We have seen this nowhere more clearly than in the domestic reactions to Obama’s handling of the Iranian elections. Whether or not Obama’s domestic critics were genuinely interested in the plight of Iran’s reformers, whom many hawkish interventionists had previously derided as fundamentally no different from their hard-line rivals, they took up the cause of the Iranian protesters and demanded more forceful rhetoric and action from the president, who resisted calls to insert himself into what was an entirely internal Iranian matter.\nWhen Obama did not heed their calls, hawkish critics were furious about the “betrayal of democracy” that this represented. However, even as he said little and did less in response to Tehran’s crackdown, Obama wanted to emphasize that his restraint was the best means of aiding Iranian dissidents. This may be true, given past U.S. interference in domestic Iranian politics and the regime’s mockery of the protests as a phony U.S.-backed “color” revolution, but the crucial point is that Obama felt compelled to explain his restraint in these terms. More than that, his aides reportedly wanted to credit the president’s earlier speech in Cairo with sparking the apparent late surge for Moussavi as a way of emphasizing the importance of soft power in shaping public opinion. In other words, the new administration wanted it known that regime change in Tehran and democracy promotion in Muslim countries, two ideas for which the previous administration was quite properly criticized as overly ideological and detached from reality, were still very much a part of U.S. policy despite any apparent changes to the contrary.\nClassifications of foreign policy schools or inclinations are never precise, whether they are applied to the thinking of individuals or entire administrations, as most policymakers combine elements from different schools and will tend to adapt their use of diplomatic, political, and military tools to changing circumstances. As we recall from the preparation for the Iraq war and the slight shifts made during the second Bush term, even inside the Bush administration one would find conflicting views and changes in the president’s own thinking over time. It is also important to bear in mind that these classifications tend to bleed into one another in practice, which is a function of the broad bipartisan consensus about the legitimacy and necessity of the projection of American power around the world, the preservation of U.S. military and political supremacy, the promotion of liberal democratic values, and the inevitability of American global leadership. Most foreign policy debates take place within these fairly narrow boundaries, and the points of contention are questions of means rather than ends.\nThis practical blurring of lines between foreign policy schools is also the result of widely shared cultural-political convictions that Andrew Bacevich has called the “ideology of national security,” which is the belief that expanding freedom (however vaguely or loosely defined) is the purpose of history and the mission of the U.S., that American actions abroad serve this purpose, and that both American freedom and security are bound up in ensuring universal freedom. While such ideas are normally associated today with neoconservatives or “hard Wilsonian” idealists, it is fair to say that this ideology is the foundation of the bipartisan consensus just described, and most internationalists—which is to say most Americans who spend any time thinking about foreign policy—partake of it to some extent.\nObama sympathizers have fixated on superficial changes in style and tone in the hopes that they represent some significant shift in policy, and enemies have discovered proof of sinister plots in the same ultimately trivial gestures. Thus Obama’s ‘recognition’ of the Iranian government by using its formal title of Islamic Republic, or the initial gestures connected with “resetting” the relationship with Russia, or even something as unremarkable as acknowledging the American role in the overthrow of Mossadegh in 1953 are taken as powerful signals one way or the other: as exciting openings to rapprochement or pathetic instances of weakness and capitulation. As it happens, the truth is far simpler than either of these interpretations allows.\nFor all of the praise—and abuse—the administration has received for its greater realism, it clearly remains committed to halting Iran’s nuclear program by any means available and to unnecessary, provocative NATO expansion into former Soviet space, even though both policies expose the U.S. to many more costs and risks rather than fewer. For all of the talk of engagement and “reset,” the substance of our Iran and Russia policies has not changed under the new administration, and it never was going to change greatly. The administration believed that it could extract concessions and aid from these states through negotiations, but it never intended to alter its behavior toward them. The president still presumes to dictate the security and energy policies of other states, and he still insists on extending our sphere of influence to Russia’s borders in the name of eliminating spheres of influence. Whichever name one wants to give to this sort of foreign policy, it remains inexplicably aggressive, hegemonic, and dangerous to U.S. interests, and it is all the more so because it comes wrapped in a veil of diplomatic gestures and the pretense of repairing damaged relations.\nDaniel Larison is contributing editor at The American Conservative, where he blogs at Eunomia, and an online columnist for The Week.

{"text": "Route: (40I-) MGY-I19-MGY\nWeather: Overcast, 28 degrees, wind 200 degrees at 6 knots\nWith 269 landings, five months of training, nearly 75 flight hours, plenty of frustration, tons of fun, at least $6000 spent, and so many great memories behind me... I'm a Private Pilot! The weather cooperated and I went up with the examiner to complete the flying portion of my checkride, following last weekend's oral exam. Everything went well and I didn't feel any nerves aside from a little hope that I wouldn't make any boneheaded mistakes. Luckily, I did not. I am now the proud holder of a Temporary Airman Certificate, good until my plastic FAA certificate arrives in the mail.\nAs I did with the oral exam, I'll share the details of the checkride below. And make sure you read the end of the post, as I got to deal with some serious craziness when I went to leave Wright Brothers.\n- I arrived at Stewart early in order to get a weather briefing, compute my weight and balance, and make sure I had all the paperwork in order. Then I had some help in starting the plane (it takes some extra work when it's 15 degrees out at night - brr!) and I let it warm up for a couple minutes. Fuel full, I left around 12:15 and got in a few practice landings at Wright Brothers before my scheduled 1:00 appointment with the examiner. Having not practiced a no-flap landing, I made one there and it was incredibly smooth. My landings felt great last night and today, hopefully a good sign for today.\n- After a quick look through my papers, we walked out to the plane and he asked me to do a preflight as if it were the first flight of the day. I walked around the plane and made my usual inspection, mentioning what I was doing on a couple occasions but for the most part not saying much. It looked like the examiner was just looking over to make sure I checked everything important. He told me he was going to get into the little 150 when I was about 2/3 of the way through the inspection. Both in the plane, I went through the pre-start checklist and got the engine running. He told me that I was PIC (Pilot in Command) so I would be responsible for the flight and should call out all traffic to him. I ran through the CIGAR checklist on the ramp (minus the runup) and then taxied down to the runup area at the end of the runway. During the runup I called out as I checked the suction (which I do even when I fly solo) and mags \"left, drop, both, right, drop, both...\" and declared us ready to fly.\n- He asked me to make a normal takeoff and then proceed on course, which was about due East to our destination in Clarksburg, WV. The takeoff was very smooth and I got to pattern altitude and turned downwind. He asked what the heck I was doing. Crap, stupid move there. I should have departed on a 45 degree heading from the takeoff runway and instead flew downwind for some stupid reason. We do use that departure at Stewart sometimes, but honestly I just totally didn't have my brain connected. No big deal, he just explained to me the reasons for specific departures and I overflew the airport and then departed on the proper 155 degree heading. Phwew.\n- Leveling off at 3,500 feet, he said I should pitch over and build up speed before pulling back the throttle. I don't know if I was taught to throttle back while leveling off or if I just invented the habit on my own, but a good idea that I'll use in the future. We were about due South of Xenia at this point (meaning we had traveled all of 10ish miles) and he had me descend to 2,500 feet and divert to Green County Airport (I19). I know you never fly much of the cross-country you plan for the checkride, but that sure was short.\n- Using my sectional, I found the frequency for I19 and entered the pattern on a 45 degree entry. He asked for a normal landing so I set up for that, starting the descent abeam the numbers on downwind. I've heard from local pilots the winds are interesting on Runway 25 because it's at the edge of a 100 foot slope down to a road and gravel pit. I anticipated that on short final but I didn't feel much. The landing was smooth but as soon as I touched down he jerked the yoke and said to get the ailerons into the wind, which was about 4 knots and 20 degrees off the nose. Doesn't seem like much but he said a lot of pilots have had the wing get under their wings because they don't think a light crosswind can do anything. Point noted sir.\n- Short field takeoffs and landings were next. The takeoff went great and I set up for an extended downwind for the landing. He told me to name my point and I said I'd touch down on the numbers. I ended up landing within a few feet of the numbers, although it was not the smoothest touchdown in my piloting career. But I landed slow and short as required, so all was well. I departed Greene County with a soft field takeoff (went well) and we turned to the South.\n- I was instructed to pick a point to turn around and said I'd use a barn in a field below. He asked what the most important thing in starting a ground reference maneuver is. \"Enter on the downwind side?\" \"No!\" \"Uh, avoid populated areas?\" \"No!\" And so it went for a couple more things I muttered out, not sure what he wanted to hear. \"To have an available emergency landing area!\" Oh, duh. Although I guess it's never been something that was specifically discussed. Not that the first barn was in rough terrain or anything but there were other houses nearby. So I picked out a barn surrounded on all four sides by large fields and made a very smooth and otherwise uneventful turn around it. That was it for ground reference maneuvers.\n- \"Your engine just died.\" Pitch to best glide... \"What are you doing?\" \"Pitching to best glide.\" \"No! You ALWAYS PULL THE CARB HEAT FIRST!!!\" Alrighty then. I swear I was taught to always pitch down first, but his point was that the carb heat will cool down in 3-5 seconds so if you don't get it on right away there will be no heat left to help. He then proceeded to pull the power on me about 3 more times in a row to make sure I yanked that carb heat out instantly. Then he left the throttle out for good and had me descend to a field, drop the flaps to 40 degrees when clear of the barn/trees, and get down to maybe 50 feet above the ground. That's the lowest I have ever gone in a practice engine-out situation and I know I would have made a survivable landing if necessary. At this point, he took control of the plane and got us out of there while I put the hood on for instrument work.\n- The hood work seemed to go by very quickly. I climbed and turned to headings he assigned, pretty basic stuff. Then came brain disconnect number two. He had me punch in a frequency and fly directly to the VOR. The needle was centered on a 125 degree heading TO and asked if I was flying to the station. \"Yes.\" \"Uh, are you sure?\" Took me a second to take my brain out of neutral and I looked at the heading indicator and saw we were heading 280. So obviously I had to turn to track the radial to the station. Again, a random stupid mistake that he thankfully gave me a second to think about and correctly answer. Then my head went down and he had me do two unusual attitude recoveries. I was surprised at how he put us into the unusual attitudes, as it was way smoother than with Joe or Dave. Both of them really threw the plane all over the place to screw me up before handing the controls back over. The first recovery was from nose-high and the second was from a pretty steep downward spiral. I quickly recovered on both and that was it for the hood work.\n- Able to look out the window again, I climbed up to 3,000 for steep turns and stalls. The turns went great, with a 360 to the left followed immediately by a 360 to the right. He covered up the altimeter but I saw I was within about 25-50 feet of my starting point when I finished the whole maneuver. I saw a plane about 500 feet above us during the turns and I called that out as I kept moving along, probably a mark in my favor since I was obviously keeping my eyes scanning. He then asked for a power on stall in a takeoff configuration so I slowed to 60 knots, added full power, and pulled back to induce the stall and recovered. However, he said I was looking too much at the sky out the front and not enough to the sides and consequently added in a little aileron without realizing. We went thru a series of power-on stalls as he demonstrated some different things and I did a few more. Then I went into the landing configuration with 40 degrees of flaps and made a couple power-off stalls. All the stalls went relatively well but he was really harping on me to make sure I only used the rudder to avoid a spin or steep spiral.\n- Hard to believe, but he told me to fly us back to Wright Brothers and make a soft field landing. We were out over Caesar Creek Lake at this point, so in flying the 5-10 minutes back we talked about random flying stuff for a bit. I spotted some planes over Stewart as I was descending. Then I entered the pattern at MGY and made an interesting soft field landing. I did touch town softly but I was drifting (not enough crosswind correction with the aileron) and floated a bit before finally getting the thing down. I didn't like it, but he obviously was satisfied as he told me to taxi back to parking. Once I shut 60338 shut down he hopped out and told me to meet him back inside, where he printed up my temporary certificate. We only flew for 1.3 hours (including probably 0.4 in taxi time on the ground) but I did enough to earn my wings!\nHappy and excited to return to Stewart as a Private Pilot, I quickly preflighted the plane and started her up. I taxied down to Runway 20, did my runup, and announced my takeoff on the CTAF. \"Cessna departing Wright Brothers, runway is closed!\" Uhh, what? Somewhere in the couple of minutes between engine start and now a Cessna 210 landed gear-up and they closed the airport. First things first, everyone in the plane was fine unless you're counting bruised egos. I never heard them call in the traffic pattern, so I must have been looking down or checking the AWOS at just the right moment to miss them fly by. Obviously I would have yelled out \"gear up, gear up!\" on the radio if I had seen them. The runway has slight hump in it, so I couldn't even see the plane sitting down there until I taxied down the runway and back to the ramp.\nEven though I would have been long airborne before passing the plane (it was 3,500 feet down the runway) the airport was now legally closed. I didn't think it would be wise to get my certificate revoked all of 30 minutes after receiving it by knowingly departing from a closed airport. It ended up taking a couple hours to get the proper FAA/NTSB approval for a crane to lift the plane up so they could flick the switch to lower the gear and tow the plane off the runway. By the time that was complete, it was dark out. I can legally fly at night, but Stewart doesn't allow landings at night except by CFIs. So Dave ended up driving over to pick me up and they'll send someone over in the morning to fly the plane back. Not the triumphant return flight I had hoped for post-checkride but it was quite the interesting thing to witness. Plus, I was able to talk to a few other stranded pilots while we sat around for a couple hours waiting.\nI'll close with a quick thanks to all of you who have been reading this blog over the past five months and sharing in the experience with me. All your comments, thoughts, suggestions and friendship has meant a lot to me and I feel lucky to have had all your support. Now it's time for us all to hop in our planes and meet up somewhere.

{"text": "Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt Review - An External with USB 3.0 and Thunderboltby Brian Klug on August 1, 2012 4:04 PM EST\nBack when Thunderbolt (then Intel Lightpeak) was optical, I was actively involved in covering the interface, partly out of professional curiosity due to my optical background, partly because I sincerely believe optical interfaces are an inevitable part of the future. When Lightpeak became Thunderbolt and lost the optical layer, it fell under Anand’s beat and the Mac umbrella. I acquired a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt somewhere around the same time, but never acquired any Thunderbolt peripherals or drives. Since then, Thunderbolt has slowly but surely gained traction with more and more peripherals and host devices. Initial adoption was glacial in part because most of the earliest Thunderbolt peripherals were really aimed at the very high end market with big RAID or JBOD stations, and partly due to what boiled down to Thunderbolt being Apple-only until just recently.\nThere’s an interesting story as to exactly why most of the initial Thunderbolt peripherals were aimed at such a high-end market, and some of it was purely because of both the TDP, size, and engineering constraints involved with the first generation Thunderbolt controllers. The other half of the equation is that selling external storage isn’t always the most valuable prospect, as shoppers expect commodity pricing and generally know the cost of the drive inside. Thankfully, second generation Thunderbolt controllers with smaller size, TDP, and lower cost are now the norm, and at the same time Apple has unleashed more Macs with the interface of note, meaning that there’s a bigger captive market of potentially interested shoppers.\nSo when Buffalo dropped us a line about an upcoming 2.5\" form factor portable hard drive with both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt interfaces, I couldn’t resist the temptation and jumped at the opportunity to review it. When it comes to single drive external Thunderbolt storage, the only real options at this point are either the Seagate GoFlex, or the new Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt.\nThe Buffalo MiniStation comes in two flavors, differentiated only in storage size. There’s a 1 TB version which runs $229.99 named the HD-PA1.0TU3, and a 500 GB version named the HD-PA500TU3 and priced at $199.99. The only difference is what drive you get inside; both include Thunderbolt and USB 3.0. Buffalo has also opted to include both the USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt cables with both MiniStations. Prior drives required the separate purchase of a Thunderbolt cable, which costs around $50. Since there are now multiple cable suppliers (whether this means the active controller in the cable, or companies cabling the system remains unknown to me), pricing has started creeping down and Buffalo was able to include both a 19.7 inch Thunderbolt cable and USB 3.0 cable.\n|Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt|\n|Storage||500 GB HDD||1 TB HDD|\n|Interface||miniUSB 3.0 (2.0 legacy), Thunderbolt (no pass through), Cables Included|\n|Size, Mass||3.17 x 5.12 x 0.91 (inches), 9.28 oz|\n|Pricing||$199.99 (newegg)||$229.99 (newegg)|\nSince Thunderbolt is still predominantly an Apple interface (7-series boards and IVB Ultrabooks notwithstanding), the industrial design of the Buffalo MiniStation is decidedly Apple inspired. The drive is made of two main parts, a single piece aluminum can in which the drive sits, and a plastic top which snaps inside this assembly.\nThere’s a series of white status LEDs which shine through a diffuse rectangular chicklet cutout on the bottom front lip, which reflects up off of a surface. The indicator light breathes like an Apple power indicator when there’s activity, and stays solid when plugged in. It’s a nice take on an external hard disk status LED that I haven’t seen done before.\nOn the underside are two small rubber feet which actually aren’t part of the aluminum base but make contact with the drive caddy inside. Regulatory markings are laser etched near the front rubber foot. At the back of course are the Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 ports, on opposite sides of the drive.\nConstruction of the MiniStation is subjectively great. There’s not much flex if you squeeze the aluminum side against the plastic lip, and it feels like a solid brick of aluminum in the hand. I’ve regularly transferred videos shot on my DSLR onto the MiniStation, then tossed the drive into the main pocket of my backpack. It isn’t a super rugged design, but definitely will get the job done.", "id": "<urn:uuid:05a10dbc-fc89-4534-8522-0a3f61f86cf8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://anandtech.com/Show/Index/6127?cPage=1&all=False&sort=0&page=1&slug=buffalo-ministation-thunderbolt-review-an-external-with-usb-30-and-thunderbolt", "date": "2013-05-18T06:44:13Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9305948615074158, "token_count": 990, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Audio length: 47:30 minutes\nTranscript published: September 22, 2010\nEnter once again into the rustic cell of Fr. Seraphim Rose with Kevin Allen as he talks with Fr. Damascene, the biographer and spiritual child of Fr. Seraphim. This is part 2 of a 3 part series and provides a unique glimpse into the life of a man who many say will someday be venerated as a Saint.\nThe interview that follows is Part 2 of a three-part series commemorating the 25th anniversary of the repose of Fr. Seraphim Rose who left this world on September 2, 1982. The interview was conducted by Illumined Heart co-host, Kevin Allen, with his biographer and spiritual child, Fr. Damascene, conducted in Fr. Seraphim’s rustic cell in the forest in Platina, California. Today’s program is titled “Fr. Seraphim Rose: The Man, the Struggler”. If you’d like information on the books published and distributed by St. Herman of Alaska Monastery, their website is www.sainthermanpress.com. Let’s return now to the rustic cell of Fr. Seraphim Rose with Kevin Allen.\nKevin: Father Damascene, thank you again for joining me on this edition of The Illumined Heart.\nFr. Damascene: Thank you, Kevin.\nKevin: It’s a blessing to be back in the monastic cell of both yourself and your mentor, Fr. Seraphim Rose, for our interview—in this edition—“The Man, the Struggler”. We’ll talk a little about Seraphim Rose as an individual. You mentioned and you’ve written in your book, Father Seraphim Rose: His Life and His Works, that a large number of figures and writers influenced Eugene Rose first and Fr. Seraphim Rose. In a brief interview, it would be impossible to go through all of the influences. But one sticks out and that one is John Maximovitch. So I thought we’d start this interview talking about St. John the Wonderworker of San Francisco, John Maximovitch, and his relationship with Fr. Seraphim Rose.\nFr. Damascene: Archbishop John was his guiding star, and he’s our guiding star. He was many things to Fr. Seraphim. He was his Hierarch when he was San Francisco’s ruling bishop. The St. Herman of Alaska brotherhood was founded with a blessing by St. John. He was the guide of the brotherhood during those early years and a personal guide and spiritual father of Fr. Seraphim. He was an example to him of what an Orthodox Christian should be. He was a living saint, as Fr. Seraphim recognized as such from the very beginning. Fr. Seraphim saw the spiritual power and grace of the Orthodox Church embodied in St. John. Fr. Alexi Young told me something that Fr. Seraphim told him back in the early days of our monastery here. He said that before Fr. Seraphim became Orthodox, he was attracted to Chinese philosophy, which he studied in depth, because it had a very noble conception of man. Later, when he became Orthodox, he found in Orthodoxy the most noble conception of man—the fulfillment of what was prefigured in Chinese philosophy. He said that he found in St. John a man more noble than any person he had met before.\nKevin: It strikes me that they were really different sorts of men in some ways. It seems to me that Fr. Seraphim was highly intellectual, almost a genius. He knew many languages and studied theology and Eastern religions. On the other hand, St. John has even been called—I hope this isn’t irreverent—a fool for Christ in some ways. They were just very different sorts of men. Do you find that ironic or striking? That a man that came from where Fr. Seraphim was coming would be so impacted by someone who had maybe a very different demeanor and orientation?\nFr. Damascene: I think that there were more similarities than differences. Obviously, they have very different backgrounds. Fr. Seraphim was raised in San Diego in an American Protestant family, and he went through this whole period of searching and struggling to find the truth. Archbishop John never went through that. He was raised in a pious, Orthodox home. So their backgrounds are very different. Where they are similar, of course, was their single-minded determination to really live out the Orthodox faith to its fullest and to really fully enter into the heart of the Church, experience the grace of the Church, and, as Fr. Seraphim said, “To find Christ in the Orthodox Church.” They were both selfless servants. Especially in Fr. Seraphim’s later life, he took on that cross of pastorship that St. John bore so nobly. In that sense they were very similar.\nIn terms of Fr. Seraphim being an intellectual and Archbishop John not being known as an intellectual, actually even in that they weren’t so different. St. John was a very intelligent person and Fr. Seraphim had this genius level IQ, but Fr. Seraphim consciously, deliberately humbled his mind. If you remember in the last talk we had, I said that Fr. Seraphim said, “I crucify my mind.” So he became like St. John. In fact, I said that St. John was a model for him. Well, he was a model for him in all ways. In presenting the theology of the Church, Fr. Seraphim was very much like St. John. Fr. Seraphim took as his example for presenting theology St. John. In fact, in an article he wrote for the 10th anniversary of St. John’s repose in 1976, he talked about the theology of St. John and began by relating a service that he had attended in San Francisco in the convent of Abbess Ariadna which was under St. John. Abbess Ariadna was a close disciple of St. John. It was the Feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God, and Fr. Seraphim, at that time Eugene Rose, was of the mindset “do we have to believe these accounts about all the Apostles being brought from the ends of the earth to attend the burial of the Mother of God? It sounds a little bit hard to believe”. Then he heard from the Abbess, during her sermon, who said, “We must believe the teaching of the Church. We must believe it simply and not doubt.” Fr. Seraphim was struck in his heart like that. He understood that we have to be simple, we have to believe simply what is handed down to us in the Church. Fr. Seraphim wrote in this article that he found that simple faith, that simple childlike faith, in St. John. That became his model for believing in the Church, believing in the theology of the Church, and presenting the theology and teaching of the Church to others.\nKevin: You wrote in your book, quoting Fr. Seraphim, where he said, “If you are an Orthodox Christian, you can do this [constantly thinking of higher things] and have people call you crazy or say that you’re a bit touched, but still you lead your own life and get to heaven.”\nFr. Damascene: Yes, I’m glad you brought that up, because that’s another aspect of St. John’s influence on Fr. Seraphim. Fr. Seraphim saw in St. John a man who lived for the other world. He was already in another world. He had his feet firmly on earth, as Fr. Seraphim said, and at the same time his mind and his heart were constantly in heaven. That’s where his heart was - as Christ said, “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” St. John’s treasure was in heaven, so he was constantly looking above. That’s one of the main things that Fr. Seraphim learned from St. John—to always be looking above. Fr. Seraphim had many struggles—after he became Orthodox and after he became a monk. There were many struggles in the monastery. Any time he would be tempted to get discouraged, and there were many times that he did, he would always be thinking of the example of St. John and how he was constantly always looking above. Fr. Seraphim would pray to St. John, “Help us out.” He knew that St. John was with him, with the brotherhood, with the monastery, as the monastery’s heavenly protector, guiding and protecting the monastery just as if he was alive and on the earth.\nKevin: So, clearly, he considered St. John Maximovitch a saint before he was officially recognized, because Fr. Seraphim reposed before that happened.\nFr. Damascene: Oh, yes. Fr. Seraphim considered him a saint while St. John was alive. At that time, in the Russian Church abroad, there were two different schools of thought on who St. John was. Some thought he was crazy—sometimes you really couldn’t depend on him; he was a little too odd, strange. And there were other people, many, many people, who regarded him as a living saint. Fr. Seraphim, from the very beginning, was in the latter group. Many of the former group repented later and acknowledged him as a saint, even at his funeral.\nKevin: St. Ignatius Brianchaninov and St. Theophan the Recluse were also important influences on Fr. Seraphim, correct?\nFr. Damascene: Yes.\nKevin: I believe somewhere he called them “the link to the Patristic Age” for those of us are in the contemporary world. How are we to understand that? Why were they considered by Fr. Seraphim to be such significant links?\nFr. Damascene: Fr. Seraphim said that if we’re going to be linked to the saints of ancient time, the Early Fathers of the Church, we have to be linked to the saints of our own time. He had that connection with St. John. And we also have to have the links to saints of recent times who transmit this Patristic wisdom from ancient times to our modern times. He said St. Ignatius (died in 1867) and St. Theophan (died in the 1890s), although they didn’t live in the 20th Century, dealt with many modern problems. Many of the issues that we face in our modern times were already known in their day. They dealt with these issues straight on and help us to know the Patristic mind as it views these various modern issues and problems.\nKevin: Moving to a different topic, from reading your book I understand that Eugene Rose prayed the panagia prayer—“Most Holy Mother of God, save us”—even before he knew the Jesus Prayer. Some might find that shocking or surprising, especially if there are any non-Orthodox out there—that he would have prayed to the Mother of God before he even prayed the Jesus Prayer formally. Can you put that in context and talk a little bit about Fr. Seraphim’s piety to the Mother of God—how it was formed in him, how he understand the place and role of the Mother of God in the life of the Orthodox Christian?\nFr. Damascene: Concerning that statement about him praying the panagia prayer before the Jesus Prayer, Fr. Seraphim prayed that prayer before he became Orthodox. He was still preparing to become an Orthodox Christian. It might have even been before he met an Orthodox priest. I don’t know, but it was definitely before he became Orthodox. He had this piety, this veneration, for the Mother of God from the very beginning. Really, this is a mystery. We just know that he was praying to the Mother of God and had this great devotion for her. Of course, he was also praying the Jesus Prayer and this was the main prayer for him, as for any Orthodox monk or Christian. But he also had this piety for the Mother of God. Every day he would say the Optina 500. That comes from the Optina Monastery. The Optina elders would have this prayer rule that they would give to people where you say 300 Jesus Prayers, then 100 prayers to the Mother of God, 50 to one’s guardian angel, and 50 to all saints.\nHe prayed much more than that and also prayed frequently akathists and canons to the Mother of God. Our former abbot, Fr. Herman, said that, especially at the end of his life, Fr. Seraphim was frequently doing these canons and akathists to the Mother of God either in the church or in his cell. And he published a book on St. John on the Orthodox veneration of the Mother of God. He understood the proper veneration. That’s really between Fr. Seraphim and the Mother of God. It’s kind of a mystery. Vladimir Lossky, in his book The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, even said that the Most Holy Mother of God is a mystery of the Church, and it’s really hard to explain to those outside the Church. We don’t believe that she is our Redemptress. Christ is our only Redeemer. But she’s a heavenly intercessor, a helper, and close to us. Fr. Seraphim had that veneration. It’s very interesting that he died in the Afterfeast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. Perhaps she took him and helped him to the other world. In our Church’s prayers, we even ask the Mother of God to help us, and, at the hour of death, to help us in the passage to heaven.\nKevin: Former Abbot Herman once called Fr. Seraphim a hesychast, and I asked this question of Abbott Gerasim when I interviewed him. For those who are listening who don’t know what that word means, it is one who prays constantly. Would you describe him as a hesychast?\nFr. Damascene: Well, Fr. Herman once told Fr. Seraphim, “Fr. Seraphim, you’re a hesychast.” Fr. Seraphim became indignant. He said, “I don’t know what that means.” He knew intellectually, but he didn’t want to pose in any way as some holy hesychast. He was not a person who stayed in his cell all the time and prayed. He prayed his cell rule at night, he said special prayers at night, and he’d be kneeling at the altar in the church in addition to attending all the daily services of the Church and serving the Divine Liturgy. He labored in the monastery. They had to labor in order to support the monastery, because they were publishing books. He was always busy and never wasted time.\nI would say that he was a hesychast in this sense: he was in a constant state of keeping his mind directed toward God and heaven, keeping his mind and his heart in the other world. He was in that constant state of watchfulness, that state of prayer. People would talk about how they would see him at the table in trapeze, saying the Jesus Prayer quietly to himself or silently. That was when people would happen to see him. What he was doing when people were not watching him, I can’t say. But from knowing him and from what other people have said, it was evident that he was in that constant state of prayer and watchfulness.\nKevin: I’d like to talk about some of the personal attributes, characteristics, and virtues of Fr. Seraphim that have been described in your book and in other places. I find it so interesting that you write that he struggled really hard to work on these. Maybe as we go through them you can highlight or give a story or give an example of each of them. I would like to quote you here for our listeners: “As Fr. Seraphim knew, transfiguration doesn’t happen of itself. He did not wait for the virtues to come naturally; but, seeing their lack in himself, he would consciously labor to acquire them, hoping on Christ to strengthen them and each day entailed constant, unseen warfare watching and fighting against the interior movements of the fallen man.” One of them, and you’ve kind of mentioned it a couple of times, is this kind of deadness to the world. Now, we tend to understand the world not as just the world we live in but the passions. Can you talk about your experience with Fr. Seraphim in that virtue?\nFr. Damascene: Definitely in terms of cutting off the passions, he was always in this watchful state. He was a dedicated, true monk. He took his monastic life seriously and the fact that he was an Orthodox Christian. He talked frequently about this struggle that the Christian life entails. He talked about how in our modern American society we don’t like struggle. He called our Modern American society “pampered”, a self-worshiping generation, the Me-Generation. He realized that we have to fight against that in ourselves—the state of always wanting to pamper ourselves, to gratify our egos and so on. So he was always in that state of putting himself to death, putting the fallen man, the old man, to death, so that Christ could live in him. He didn’t have idle moments, but was constantly laboring, praying, or somehow working for the Kingdom of God every minute of his life.\nHe talked a lot about the virtue of constancy, that we have to be constant in our daily practice of our spiritual life, constantly giving ourselves to daily spiritual injections—reading the lives of the saints, reading the spiritual literature, the Holy Scriptures, going to the services of the Church, our daily prayers, etc. He lived that life of constancy and stability, staying in one place, laboring with one’s salvation and not floating around from place to place. All these things helped him to die to the world of the passions. But in addition to that, he was dead to the world in the sense of dead to any kind of intellectual modern fashions. He saw the modern world as an anomaly. Even before he became Orthodox, he understood the modern world to be an anomaly, turned away from the wisdom that was known in ancient times and more engrossed in materialism, sensuality, and so on.\nKevin: …and the philosophies that come out of that.\nFr. Damascene: Yes, the philosophy of the 20th Century is nihilism, quoting from Nietzsche. The other side of nihilism is chiliasm which is the belief that since there is no God and no heaven, let’s make the kingdom of God on this earth. That’s where this whole pampered, self-worshiping generation comes out of. He says that we have to realize that that is in ourselves—we have this nihilism in ourselves, this unbelief in ourselves, and we have to war against and struggle against it. That’s why he was able to see through the deceptions of the modern times, whereas many contemporary Orthodox Christians kind of go along with the spirit of the times. We can kind of mix Orthodoxy with the mind of the times, with the contemporary world view and cosmology. Fr. Seraphim was able to cut through that deception. Where the teachings of the Holy Fathers, for example, were at variance with the modern world view and cosmology, modern scientific theoretical models, Fr. Seraphim openly taught that these were incompatible, and this is the teaching of the Fathers. He did not try to make some artificial combination and force the teachings of the Fathers into the modern cosmology. He didn’t want to view Orthodoxy and the teachings of the Fathers from the point of view of a modern mind looking at them. He wanted to look at the modern world from the point of view of the Holy Fathers. In order to do that, he had to acquire the mind of the Fathers. In order to acquire the mind of the Fathers, he had to put to death his own mind. That’s why he said, “I crucify my mind.” That’s what makes him so special. He was this great intellect, but he crucified that mind, humbled it. He had that simple faith of St. John and all saints.\nKevin: You’ve written that he was a discerner of the times. I think we’ve kind of covered that one. He saw the times for what they were. He didn’t buy into the nonsense that most of us buy into. He was able to separate the wheat from the proverbial chaff and know what the Patristic mindset was. Is that correct?\nFr. Damascene: Yes. Even before he became Orthodox, he was involved with that whole nihilistic mentality. He kind of lived through that and emerged out of it, so it gave him kind of an edge to understand the nature of the times. He was also on the vanguard of that whole movement toward Eastern religions that occurred in the West, beginning in the late 50s and early 60s. He was able to show the way out of that as well.\nKevin: You’ve spoken about this but maybe you can just highlight on his humility and the fact that there is “no spiritual pretense or affectation on him” (your words).\nFr. Damascene: He didn’t think much of himself really. He knew what he was about, and he knew what Orthodoxy was about. In that sense, he was very firm in his conviction and belief. But personally he didn’t think much of himself. He didn’t want to exalt himself in any way or think of himself highly. That’s why, as I said earlier, when Fr. Herman called him a hesychast, he didn’t like it at all. I remember that I was at a lecture at St. Herman pilgrimage in 1981, and I was sitting in the audience. Fr. Seraphim was giving a talk and asking for questions and answers. Some person stood up in the back and said, “Fr. Seraphim, I perceive you are a holy man.” Fr. Seraphim did not like that and said, “Get to the question. What’s the question?” That’s just one example. In knowing him and with people telling me about him, I know that he really cultivated that virtue of humility. And certainly whatever intellectual power he had, he had no pride in that. It meant nothing in the scheme of things in the Christian life.\nKevin: You write that love was something that was important and you experienced that. Tell us about that. That’s a virtue that, with someone like him, maybe you wouldn’t expect with his intellect and ascetism. Can you talk about how that manifested itself?\nFr. Damascene: I mentioned before that he went through this spirit of intellectual elitism before he became Orthodox. I don’t think he was very loving there. I think deep down he had a loving heart, but it wasn’t opened up. Through the grace of the Church, when he was received into the Church and received the sacraments of the Church and living the Orthodox life and had such examples before him, like St. John, that love blossomed out in him. It just grew as time went on, especially as he grew as a pastor. His faith matured right up to the time of his death. His love was manifested in his concern and care for people and his suffering for and over them, praying for them. We had these young men sing in the monastery and some of them came from troubled backgrounds. Fr. Seraphim would be praying in the altar at night, weeping over these people. Many people would talk about how he would sacrifice for them. It would be snowing outside, and he would have to walk several times up and down the hill to get people’s cars stuck out of the road. So there were many ways that he sacrificed himself, and that’s where we see most of all that love. He talked about that a lot.\nHe saw that one of the main dangers of Orthodoxy in our times is this “head knowledge”—we become Orthodox in order to be better than the Protestants or Catholics, or we know more than them, or we have the right teaching, etc. It’s a temptation because Orthodoxy means “right glorification”. So people have this temptation to be correct, to be intellectually superior to others.\nKevin: Hyper Orthodox.\nFr. Damascene: Yes. It’s all in the head, and he would say that’s not going to save you. You have to develop your heart. You have to have a Christian heart. He would say that you can be Orthodox without being Christian, in the sense that you can intellectually have these right beliefs but you’re not really living a Christian life. We have to develop, make the heart more supple and warm, and we have to pray for that.\nKevin: Speaking of heart, that’s a great lead in on this aspect of his personality—pain of heart and suffering. I know that his monastic partner and former Abbot Herman wrote, “Above all, Fr. Seraphim knew how to suffer.” You also refer to the pain of heart. Can you talk a bit about how Fr. Seraphim understood the pain of heart and suffering in the life of an Orthodox Christian?\nFr. Damascene: He said that the main key to enter into the mind of the Holy Fathers was precisely that pain of heart. I think he meant different things by that. It’s the suffering that all Christians must endure in this world, because we’re not of this world. We’re living for another world, so we’re not going to fit in totally with the world. We’re going to have to suffer in some way in the world, if we’re really living an Orthodox life. If we feel totally comfortable in the world, then something’s wrong. That kind of suffering is one aspect.\nSecondly, pain of heart is repenting over one’s sins. There is pain of heart in praying for others and caring for other people. Elder Paisios of Mt. Athos talks a lot about feeling pain in one’s heart when praying for others. He said, in order for one’s prayers to really be effectual, you really have to feel that pain. Another aspect of pain of heart is a literal pain of heart. The Holy Fathers, including Elder Paisios, talk about the literal pain of heart where the mind descends into the heart—the heart is the center and pious part of the soul, the nous—and a person can literally feel pain in the physical organ of the heart. Fr. Seraphim said that the heart is not just a pump—it’s an organ that knows God. The Holy Fathers, including St. Silhouan the Athonite, talk about how we have the physical heart in addition to the metaphysical heart, which is the center of our being and the place where we feel that repentance and pain of suffering over others and our praying for them.\nKevin: For those of us who are not in a vocational place where we can really approach that level of understanding (I’m tempted to go there, but I know it’s above my head), would pain of heart be just caring deeply for others, putting others above self and sharing in the suffering of others and the world and over one’s sins?\nFr. Damascene: Yes, absolutely. We pray with all our heart, and that’s a kind of pain of heart. Nobody is without suffering. Suffering is the reality of the human condition since the fall. God has allowed that in order to remind us that we’re not God, and we have to return to God. This fallen world is not our final home, but the Kingdom of heaven is our final home. So we’re going to suffer. The question is what are we going to do in that suffering? Are we going to seek distraction…\nFr. Damascene: Drugs, Valium, or some technological device where we can entertain ourselves and tune everything out…\nKevin: Entertain ourselves to death…\nFr. Damascene: Yes, exactly. What are we going to do in that suffering? Are we going to try and escape from it? There are so many ways. The world is perfecting the art of escaping from suffering. Each year new things come out to escape from suffering. But instead of escaping from it we have to face that suffering and endure it. As St. Mark the Ascetic said, “Endure it in the spirit of devotion to Christ.” That’s what pain of heart is. Are we going to lay that suffering before God in prayer, in the spirit of devotion? Are we going turn away from God, tune him out, and seek distraction? Each person, whether or not he can enter these deep levels of prayer of the heart, can enter into that experience of pain of heart.\nKevin: Thank you for clarifying that. I appreciate that and I know our listeners will too. I think I read in one of your interviews that said you always felt deep stillness in his presence.\nFr. Damascene: Yes. First of all, literally. When I would sit and talk with him—I remember sitting on a little log outside the church, and I would be talking about things going on at the campus, and he would just listen. Then I would say something, and he would just say a few words. He wouldn’t say much and then he would become silent. He would be waiting for me to say something. Then I would say something and he would say something. If he had something to say, he’d say it. There would be these moments of silence. Fr. Seraphim didn’t want to say an unnecessary word. You can read the writings of the Holy Fathers, like St. Joseph of Optina. People said he really didn’t say too much. It’s because he didn’t want to speak an unnecessary word. He didn’t want to offer his own ideas. He wanted it to come from the Holy Spirit. If he was asked a question, then it meant that he was called upon to answer. So oftentimes, Fr. Seraphim would just be silent.\nI have a friend who is an Orthodox Christian who became Orthodox just about the same time that I did, in fact she was at Fr. Seraphim’s first lecture at UC Santa Cruz. She remembers talking with Fr. Seraphim. She would be talking away, and Fr. Seraphim kind of had his hand near his mouth, and then she noticed that she was crossing his mouth. Her understanding of that was that Fr. Seraphim didn’t want to offer any words from his own wisdom, his own opinion. He wanted to offer something that came from God. In that sense, he had that silence. That was a literal sense of silence.\nAlso, there is that spiritual sense. Many people have talked about this, and I myself have experienced it. Fr. Vladimir Anderson is a close, spiritual godson of Fr. Seraphim, as was Fr. Alexi Young who is now Hiermonk Ambrose. They both talk about when they were in Fr. Seraphim’s presence, there was a stillness that kind of radiated from him. They would come with these problems, and they were kind of agitated, coming from the world, and they were in the presence of Fr. Seraphim. Even though he didn’t have to say many words, that stillness was contagious. They caught that stillness and walked away feeling it. Another spiritual daughter of Fr. Seraphim, Barbara Murray, says that she would come to Fr. Seraphim with all kinds of perplexities, and she would wonder, “How am I going to deal with all these problems that I am facing in my life?” She would leave Fr. Seraphim and go to church and suddenly all the problems didn’t seem important at all. He had that stillness. Also, Fr. Alexi said that at the end of Fr. Seraphim’s life, right before he died (it was the last time he saw Fr. Seraphim before he got sick), he sat outdoors with Fr. Seraphim talking and he felt that very profoundly, that stillness that came from his being totally at peace. Right before he died, he had really entered into that deep stillness, that peace.\nFr. Damascene: Palpable stillness, yes…\nKevin: …that could be communicated to others almost.\nFr. Damascene: It’s like what Christ said, “My peace I give you, not as the world gives, give I unto you.” It’s Christ’s peace. It’s not the peace of the world. This is what Fr. Seraphim had.\nKevin: Again, I’m quoting a lot of former Abbot Herman from your book, but he said that he learned patience from Fr. Seraphim.\nFr. Damascene: Yes, that was a virtue that he had and cultivated. I mentioned earlier that he talked about these virtues of constancy and stability. Even before he became a monk, there was another friend of the brotherhood from the very early days, when Fr. Seraphim was still a layman and working in the Orthodox bookstore—a friend named Anthony. He was a layman, and Fr. Seraphim (at that time, Eugene Rose) would talk to him about stability. He would say that if you go to a parish and you find that there is better chanting in another parish, or perhaps the spiritual father spends more time with people in confessions or maybe the spiritual level seems higher in another parish, whatever it is that seems more spiritual, don’t go, don’t leave your parish. Stay in one place. If you jump around from place to place, you’re not really putting down roots, and you can’t really grow spiritually. In order to grow spiritually, you have to put down those roots. Fr. Seraphim did that very much in his own life. When he came to the monastery, he just wanted to stay here. He didn’t even want to travel. Fr. Herman would say to him, “Don’t you want to go to Mt. Athos?” Fr. Seraphim would say, “No, we have to find Mt. Athos in our own hearts.”\nKevin: Father, you wrote in the eighth chapter of your book, Father Seraphim Rose: His Life and His Works, entitled “The Taste of Hell”, the “forbidden deeds” that, at that time Eugene Rose, had “disgusted him even at the time he was committing them”. You don’t go into details and I’m not asking for the details. But I’m assuming that they were of a sexual or fleshly nature. I’m wondering how and what did Fr. Seraphim counsel on these sorts of struggles.\nFr. Damascene: Well, he gave the teachings of the Fathers on dealing with sexual temptations and passions. Of course, he recognized that this was a very prevalent problem in our times. I think it’s more prevalent today since his repose, with Internet pornography. It’s a new thing the devil has invented to tempt people. In one letter that he wrote to a spiritual son he said, “Flee quickly to the prayer of Jesus,” quoting from Abbot Barsanuphius of Gaza which he translated. He says, “Flee quickly to the prayer of Jesus and you will find repose. Pray ceaselessly, saying ‘Lord Jesus Christ, deliver me from shameful passions.’” So he would counsel to turn to God in prayer. If we turn to God in prayer, first of all, we can’t be indulging in these sexual passions in our mind or physically if we’re in the presence of God and conscious of God’s presence. Fr. Seraphim constantly had God in his mind. His mind and heart were directed toward heaven and God. If we have our mind in heaven like that, then we won’t be going down to the earth to these sinful passions. So, first of all, raising the mind to God in that way is a major help. Secondly, God does help. We pray to God, and it’s not just the fact that we’re turning our mind to him. It’s not just psychologically, but we are receiving God’s grace and help. There were other counsels he gave concerning avoiding over familiarity with people with whom you might be tempted to have a sinful relationship with. Just being constantly on guard in the spiritual life.\nKevin: Father, you commented to me in your book. You mentioned that Eugene Rose had written in a letter some suicidal thoughts. Former Abbot Herman mentioned that he definitely had a death wish. What would you say to those who might comment that, because of his psychology, Fr. Seraphim represents a Christianity which somewhat overplays morbidity.\nFr. Damascene: We have to distinguish between the “old” Eugene Rose and the “reborn” Eugene Rose and Fr. Seraphim. Fr. Seraphim was literally reborn when he entered the Orthodox Church. He wrote about this. He said that he had been reborn in the Lord and he had felt such joy that he had never known. All the goodness that was already in his nature just blossomed out and was multiplied by the grace of God which united with his soul. He became a new being. It was that old Eugene Rose that had those suicidal thoughts. As you mentioned, in one of Fr. Seraphim’s letter, during a very dark period of his life before his conversion, he does mention having suicidal thoughts. He was in despair of not finding the truth. They said that he experienced the torments of hell even while he was alive. He had consciously turned away from God, because he had not found him in the religion in which he was raised. He was looking for something more, looking for that truth. He encountered that truth in Orthodoxy. When he became Orthodox, he became a new person. Of course he had no suicidal thoughts after he became Orthodox. There’s no record of that, and I certainly would doubt it, knowing of his true rebirth in Christ and the Orthodox Church.\nBut he had a healthy remembrance of death, as the Fathers talk about, and wanted to continue working. He felt that we had a limited time in order to do the work of God. He said, “It’s later than you think; therefore, hasten to do the work of God.” He had that awareness. He had a limited number of years, and he wanted those years in order to come closer to God, to find God. He told Fr. Alexi young that if you don’t find God in this life, you will not find him in the life to come. He wanted to draw closer to Christ and have that closer experience of Christ in the Church—the deeper experience of the Church. And an important part of his life was to bring that Orthodox faith and grace of the Church to others, to the non-Orthodox, to be a disseminator of grace. He wanted to bring the truth that he had discovered in the Orthodox Church and over which he had suffered so long to find. He wanted to give that truth to others, and that truth was Jesus Christ. He said that, when he became Orthodox, he understood that truth was a person. So he had that desire to live and bring forth fruit in the time God gave him. Therefore, I don’t think he was morbid. He definitely had a healthy understanding of Christian struggle and the place of suffering in life. Maybe that’s what some people might consider morbid. He was a monk and just lived the life of a true monk. I don’t think he was extreme.\nKevin: Which raises a question, as we’re leaning toward the wrap up of this interview, and that is this: Since his work is so missionizing and evangelical in orientation, and since he was a discerner of the times and talked about topics which are so important in the modern world we live in (therefore, a lot of people will read them), do you think that there is a temptation perhaps, for those of us who are not monastics and who read the work of one whom you’ve just described as being a maximalist, to perhaps confuse his vocation and calling as a monk with the normal or appropriate non-monastic life for those who are reading his work? Is there some way you can respond to that?\nFr. Damascene: Well, he did write his works for the non-monastics as well as the monastics. He wrote for the general readership and trying to reach out to everyone. He wrote a lot about putting the monastic texts of the Orthodox Church in their proper context, according to one’s own spiritual state. He said that we should not, either as monks or lay people, be proud and think that we can apply some very lofty teachings in the line of Divine Ascent or the Philokalia to our own spiritual state as if we are on the level of a saint. We have to realize that we’re starting our spiritual life at the lowest step, whether we’re monks or lay people. We have to have a down-to-earth, realistic understanding of our own low spiritual state, and the low spiritual state of our times. As I mentioned before, he said we have to understand that we come out of the self-worshiping, pampered generation. So, I think his writings are applicable to everyone, because he meant them to be that way, and he has many warnings in his writings against misapplying spiritual texts to one’s spiritual condition.\nKevin: So he didn’t expect obviously everybody who would read his works to come to the wilderness and live in a ten by fifteen foot, rustic cell.\nFr. Damascene: Absolutely not. He would not expect that. His constant teaching was that we are to apply the teachings of the Church, the writings of the Fathers and the monastic saints, etc. to our own condition.\nKevin: Father, as we wrap up, I have one final question, and it’s a tough one because it’s so broad. What in your opinion about Fr. Seraphim’s life and writing has inspired and fascinated so many people all over the world. You mentioned Russia. They may have read more about him than people in the States. What is it about his life and his work?\nFr. Damascene: There are many aspects and many things that can be said about that. First of all, he was a discerner of the times. He understood the modern times very deeply, and he also understood the Orthodox faith very deeply. So he was able to cut through the deceptions of the times and give the Orthodox teaching, the teaching of the Fathers, straight. When you go to Fr. Seraphim, you find the pure teaching of the Fathers, the pure water of grace that come from those writings. It’s not distorted or twisted or artificially molded to conform to the modern mentality. You find a basic honesty in his writings, which I think is very refreshing for many people. Some people can kind of fudge a little bit. If there’s a teaching of the Church that’s a little bit too hard for our self-worshiping, pampered generation to take, they can kind of fudge a little bit, kind of soften it around the edges. Fr. Seraphim didn’t do that. I think some people get turned off by that and have a hard time with it. But there are many people who want that. I really appreciate that.\nI should say, also, Fr. Seraphim can be very hard-hitting in his writings, because he was writing for everybody and this was going out to the world. He didn’t want to compromise or sugarcoat anything. But pastorally, when he was dealing with people on a one-to-one basis, he was different. You see that in his letters. Therefore, you’re dealing with a soul, and the soul has these various burdens and obstacles. He understood as a pastor that you have to reach out to a person where there are and not expect too much. As Christ said you don’t want to put new wine into old bottles. So he was very careful with that. For example, when he talked with people who were involved in Eastern religions, he would take a different tone than when he was writing about Orthodoxy and the religion of the future. When he was writing to people coming out of a Charismatic background, he would be different.\nKevin: That’s an important nuance of reading him, that as a pastor he was applying that warm-heartedness and love, whereas here had to deal with a movement or large issue of the times. It might come across a little on the strong side or the hard-hitting side. Father Damascene, again, thank you very much for this wonderful interview. It’s very much appreciated.", "id": "<urn:uuid:30e5f942-2f29-4ba9-8952-d80600febe50>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ancientfaith.com/podcasts/illuminedheart/fr_seraphim_rose_the_man_the_struggler/print", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9877641797065735, "token_count": 9709, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Below, I essentially replicate his results with the purpose of trying to reproduce them in a way that is a little easier for mere mortals like myself to digest. Instead of showing the entire distribution, I use mean values for each group. Razib concludes:\nThe general qualitative result: American conservative Protestants are in the main to the center or social liberal end of Muslim public opinion. They are not comparable at all to Muslim reactionaries.As the averages make clearer, conservative Protestants (defined here as those who expressed a preference for the Republican party) are in fact more liberal on each of these issues than Muslims in any of the countries included are. Keep in mind, the comparison here is between conservative Protestants and all Muslims, not just between evangelicals and reactionary Islamists. The latter comparison would show conservative Protestants to be even more liberal relative to Muslims than this comparison does.\nFinally, using standard deviation values reported in the WVS, each of the tables also shows where the average conservative Protestant fits into the Muslim distribution*. So, on the question of the justifiability of homosexuality, the average conservative American Protestant is at 71st percentile of the Muslim population. Because the wife-beating question is inverted, the figure shows where the average conservative Protestant falls on the another-black-eye-to-explain-to-the-neighbors-is-unjustifiable distribution. The higher the value (on a 1-10 scale), the more justifiable the act or behavior in question is viewed as being:\n|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.2|\n|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||71st percentile|\n|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.5|\n|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||73rd percentile|\n|Man to beat his wife||Score|\n|Conservative Protestants (US)||1.3|\n|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||63rd percentile|\nWVS variables used: V185, V231(Republican), V202, V204, V208\n* Arrived at by simply averaging the averages of each of the Muslim groups on each question. This skews Muslim opinion towards that of the Middle East and North Africa and away from South Asia, which, in terms of sheer numbers, is unrepresentative of the world's roughly 1.6 billion Muslims. Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh all have far more Muslims than any of the MENA countries do, but with the exception of Pakistan, when Americans think of Muslims, they primarily have Arabs and Persians in mind.", "id": "<urn:uuid:72d93b86-e729-4691-baf5-73415c854495>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2012/05/religious-conservatives-in-us-more.html?showComment=1336500736575", "date": "2013-05-18T07:19:36Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.893719494342804, "token_count": 515, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Octodon degus is generally considered endemic to west central Chile, where it inhabits the lower slopes of the Andes. Although some have argued that its range may extend north into Peru, this is not well supported. It is common in the international pet trade, however, and is often used in laboratory studies outside of its native range. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus inhabits a mediterranean-type semi-arid shrubland ecosystem called \"matorral\", which is found on the western slopes of the Andes between 28 and 35 degrees south latitude. Further north the climate becomes too arid to support this plant community, and further south it is too wet. Degus appear to be limited to elevations below 1200 meters, both by the distribution of their habitat and by their intolerance of low oxygen partial pressure. Degus are well able to inhabit lands influenced by cattle grazing, and are agricultural pests in some areas. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Fulk, 1976)\nOctodon degus superficially resembles a gerbil, but is much larger. Degus typically weigh between 170 and 300 g, and measure between 325 and 440 mm in length, including the tail. The fur is yellow-brown on the back and head, and the underparts and feet are cream colored. There is a pale band around the eye and, in some individuals, the neck. The tail is moderately long and conspicuously tufted. The ears are large and darkly pigmented. The fifth digit is reduced, and on the forefeet it has a nail instead of a claw. The cheekteeth are hypsodont and their biting surfaces resemble a figure of eight. Sexes are difficult to distinguish, but males tend to be about 10% larger than females. Pups are born furred and able to see, and begin exploring within hours of birth. Octodon degus can be distinguished from the two other members of the genus Octodon by slight differences in dental morphology. It is also smaller than its relatives and its tail is said to be more noticeably tufted. (Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004)\nDuring the annual breeding season, male-male aggression temporarily increases. Males exclude other males from their burrow and monopolize the females (usually 2 to 4) who live there. Dustbathing and urine marking may be used in the defense of territory by both sexes, but these behaviors particularly increase in the male during the breeding season. Courting males often engage in mutual grooming with females, and frequently perform a courtship ritual which involves wagging of the tail and trembling of the body. The male then raises a hind leg and sprays urine onto the female. This may serve to familiarize her with his scent and perhaps make her more receptive to his advances in the future. Receptive females may sometimes enurinate males in a similar fashion. Related female degus may nurse each other's young. (Ebensperger and Caiozzi, 2002; Fulk, 1976; Kleiman, 1974; Soto-Gamboa, 2005)\nIn the wild degus tend to breed once per year. The breeding season usually begins in late May (autumn in Chile), and the young are conceived in late winter to early spring (September to October). In wet years, degus may produce second litters. It has been suggested that degus may be induced ovulators, but this has not been established for certain. There is also some evidence that male reproductive organs may be sensitive to changes in photoperiod. The gestation period is 90 days, and litter size is typically 4-6 pups. The young are precocial. They are born with fur and teeth; their eyes are open and they are able to move about the nest on their own. Pups are weaned at 4 to 5 weeks, and become sexually mature between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Degus do not reach adult size until about 6 months of age, however, and they generally live in same-sex social groups until they are about 9 months old and their first breeding season occurs. It has been reported that pups raised in isolation in the laboratory experience severe neural and behavioral abnormalities. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nBefore conception can occur, the male degu must invest considerable energy in the defense of his territory and harem from other males. The female subsequently expends considerable energy in gestation and lactation. The pregnancy is relatively long for a rodent, and the young are born well developed. After birth, both parents protect and provision the pups. Degus nest communally, and groups of related females nurse one another's young. In the laboratory, the female remains close to the pups until two weeks after birth, and males have been observed to huddle with the young during this period without instances of infanticide. In the wild, male degus may spend as much time feeding and huddling with the young as females do. Pups begin to eat solid food at about two weeks of age, and venture out of the burrow at three weeks. Upon weaning at four to six weeks, the pups are able to live independently of the parents and form same-sex social groups until their first breeding season. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nIn laboratory conditions, degus typically live five to eight years.\nDegus are social and tend to live in groups of one to two males and two to five related females. Females participate in rearing on another's young. Groups maintain territories throughout much of the year. Degus are semi-fossorial, digging extensive communal burrow systems. These burrows are often shared by Bennett's chinchilla rat (Abrocoma bennettii). Degus feed exclusively above ground, however, and have been observed climbing into the low branches of shrubs while foraging. Dustbathing is an important social behavior among degus. Groups repeatedly mark favorite wallows with urine and anal gland secretions. This may help the group identify each other by scent as well as delineating territorial boundaries. Degus are mainly diurnal, and are most active during the morning and evening. (Ebensperger, et al., 2004; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nFulk (1976) estimated that social groups of degus occupy home areas of roughly 200 square meters, and that their density is about 75 degus per hectare. This may be an underestimate, however, due to the trapping methods used. (Fulk, 1976)\nDegus have well-developed sight, smell, and hearing. They are highly vocal and use various calls to communicate with one another, including alarm calls, mating calls, and communication between parents and young. Vision is very important in avoidance of predators and in foraging. It has been shown that degus are able to see ultraviolet wavelengths, and that their urine reflects in the UV range when fresh. It has therefore been suggested that degus' urine scent marks are also visual cues. These scent marks are also used as dust wallows, allowing members of a social group to identify each other by scent. (Chavez, et al., 2003; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nDegus are generalist herbivores. They feed on the leaves, bark, and seeds of shrubs and forbs. Among their favorite foods are the bark of Cestrum palqui and Mimosa cavenia, leaves and bark of Proustia cuneifolia, Atriplex repunda, and Acacia caven, annuals such as Erodium cicutarum when in season, green grasses, and thistle seeds. Degus choose food items that reduce fiber and increase nitrogen and moisture in the diet, and thus prefer young leaves and avoid woodier shrubs. Degus rely on microbial fermentation in their enlarged cecum (they are \"hindgut fermenters\") to digest their food. They reingest a large percentage of their feces, usually during the night. This allows them to maximize their digestion. Degus store food in the winter, and it has been reported that they occasionally eat meat in old age. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998; Kenagy, et al., 1999; Veloso and Kenagy, 2005; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus is subject to predation by larger mammals such as culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus), and from the air by raptors such as barn owls (Tyto alba), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), and black-chested buzzard eagles (Geranoaetus melanoleucus). Degus use vigilance and cover to avoid predators. Their pelage is also counter-shaded and matches the soil color, which reduces visibility to predators. Degus live socially and use alarm calls to warn others of danger. When a predator is spotted, they take cover in shrubby areas and may retreat to the communal burrow. (Ebensperger and Wallem, 2002; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus affects the plant community in its habitat by selective browsing. Degus behaviorally reduce the fiber content of their diet, preferrentially eating shrubs such as Adesmia bedwellii, Baccharis paniculata, and Chenopodium petioare, which are less fibrous and less thorny than others. These species have been shown to increase their foliage area upon exclusion of degus. As degus are very common, they are themselves an important food source for their predators. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998)\nDegus often live in association with Bennett's chinchilla rats (Abrocoma bennettii). The two species are known to share burrow systems and have even been observed in the same chamber within a burrow. This is believed to be a mutualistic relationship, but it is not well understood. (Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nDegus are frequently kept as pets, and are used extensively in laboratory research. Because they are largely diurnal, they are useful in research on circadian rhythms, and their intolerance of sugars makes them ideal models for diabetes research. (Lee, 2004)\nDegus are significant agricultural pests in some areas. They take advantage of cultivated prickly pear cactus, wheat, vineyards, and orchards as abundant food sources, and can do considerable damage. They are also known to host three species of parasites that can infect humans.

{"text": "The first day of spring was a couple of days ago, and I for one am glad to see it - except that I can already tell the pollen is starting to come out. I'm like a human barometer for that every year. :-)\nI'm sorry I have not posted much here over the last few weeks. I've been incredibly busy with regular store business. For folks that blog several times a week, or even several times a day, my question is - how the heck do you guys have the time? I always think of Glen Reynolds over at Instapundit. He posts maybe 10-20 times a day all day long, and I figure whatever else he does, his entire life must revolve around his blog. When he's not blogging, he's thinking about blogging, or looking for things to blog about, or conversing with people that write in about the blog. I seem to always have something else to do that needs to be done NOW. Anyway, my goal here is going to be to post at least once a week, so we'll see how that turns out.\nIt has been another exciting week here at Anime Corner world headquarters, and I have several items to share with you:\nErgo Proxy 3 arrived on Friday - we had it air freighted in from Geneon so we could start shipping orders as early as possible. We're shipping it now and all of your pre-orders were filled by close of business on Friday March 23rd. Oh yeah, all of our copies of Ergo 3 in this shipment have the limited pencil board - we'll be shipping those first until they run out.\nI spend a lot of my time here on 'logistics' - you know, figuring out where and when and how stuffis coming, and there certainly has been a lot of activity in that dept this week. We got a slew of new solicitations over that last couple of weeks for June and July titles and we'll have them all up on the site shortly. A couple of the new titles include Galaxy Angel AA and MAR which are already posted. Also, Geneon will be re-releasing Ikki Tousen in a Thin-Pak (same price, same bat channel) in June and won't be repressing the old box, so it will probably be unavailable for a short time until the new boxes come out. Finally, we now have the last volume of Inu Yasha up for pre-order - volume #55! Wow - 4 years to get a series released, it reminds me if Urusei Yatsura or DBZ. Now when are the rest of those IY boxed sets coming??.... -_^\nWe have a couple more date changes this week - in fact there have been so many lately they are getting hard to keep up with. Tactics 4 was pushed from 3-20 to 3-27, but became moot as it has already arrived. The new company Illumitoon pushed the BoBoBoBo 2 DVD from 4-6 to 5-1. They also announced that the Beet 2 DVD and the BT'X 2 DVD have been pulled entirely from the release schedule and will be re-announced at a later date. Since these titles have sold moderately well, one can only speculate at this point as to what their plans are, but we'll keep on top of things and let you know. Geneon cancelled the Paradise Kiss 3 Special Edition DVD, but the regular edition is still set to street on April 17th.\nI know I've done a lot of talking about the upcoming Melancholy limited edition boxes. Sam, the product manager at Bandai, told me this week that they are producing exactly 20,000 boxed sets for the North American release, and they were surprised by the massive amount of retailer pre-orders for them that have already been placed. The boxes are made overseas and the order has been placed by Bandai, so Sam says quote \"once they are gone there is no more - period\". I can almost guarantee you that this box is now, or almost is, sold out in pre-release and will be allocated to retailers by Bandai. Sam said that retailers who order early will be more likely to get the product that they ordered. That's good news as we got our order in on the first day, so our units are right at the front of the line and we will be able to guarantee delivery of boxes up to about the first 500 pre-ordered (we're 82% of the way there now as of 3/23), and I will probably close the pre-order window once we hit the 500 mark.\nWe have posted quite a few new announcements for pre-order, some of the more notable include Wings of Rean, the 4th Naruto Uncut Box, the 2nd Prince of Tennis Box, the 2nd Ranma 1/2 Thin-Pak, and the first Freedom DVD (HDDVD/DVD) which will be the very first HD-DVD Anime release here in North America. I was wondering when that was going to happen. :-)\nA lot of people have been asking us recently what we plan to do about the postal rate increase coming next month. Admittedly shipping charges have been a point of consternation for us as we try to offer you a great deal of choices, excellent delivery time and quality, and still offer shipping at a reasonable price. We have not increased our shipping prices in 3 years even though all of the carriers have increased their rates to us several times during this period. As shipping has become the 'condiment' of the internet shopping world (you know, serve a lower quality hot-dog but give the mustard away for free), it's become very challenging for us to try to put together a new shipping program that covers our actual freight costs but that fits the requirements of all of your diverse needs. We are currently working on a new shipping program that is similar to what we offer now, with our usual diverse selection or types, carriers, and quality of delivery, but that will also offer more choices for budget minded customers. We'll be integrating the new program into the new order checkout manager, and we would greatly appreciate any input on this subject that you guys have for us. Your comments help us better tailor our program to fit your specific needs, and that's what it's all about.\nAfter many requests, we've expanded our trade in program to include video games, even really old ones. Check our trade in FAQ for details.\nI have two great sales for you this week, one is a newsletter exclusive set of coupons that you canuse across the store, and the other is a nice set of overstocked figure discounts (up to 35% off) that we need to move out to make room for new arrivals. Newsletter subscribers can combine the two offers to save even more! See below for all the info.\nTo save 3% off any order over $75, use the following coupon code during checkout:\nOr to save 5% off any order over $150, use the following coupon code during checkout:\nCoupons are valid ONLY for NEW orders, and are good through Thursday, March 29th only.\nYou can combine the two offers to save even more!\nWe have some great new stuff for this week in just about every category from DVD's to Manga to Figures to Statues, and even some cool new character merchandise including new scrolls and a couple of rare Anime themed bath towels that arrived from Japan. Be sure to take a look at the excellent new Sana Horiuchi figure from Pia Carrot and the very large Tamaki Kousaka from To Heart as they are two of my favorites. Also, we have a few of both of the new Tandem Twins girls left over after filling your pre-orders - including the much sought after 'option' parts that bring the figures, well, to their full potential. :-)\nFinally, we received a special shipment of art books that I was able to coax away from one of our vendors in Tokyo. Many of these gorgeous art books have been out of print for more than 5 years and since they are extremely rare we might only have as little as 2 or 3 copies of each.\nThis little shipment was a long time in the making, and I hope we are able to help you fill some of the holes in your collection. I know it certainly helped mine. :-)", "id": "<urn:uuid:ba7abe35-1add-44d8-89d4-dc880bf01545>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://animecornerstore.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:13:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9792786240577698, "token_count": 1712, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Monday, April 27, 2009\n***Photo by Elliot Cowan. Left to right: me, Linda Beck, and Tim Rauch. Deeper in the background are Willy Hartland and Ray Kosarin. From drinks after the ASIFA event.\nASIFA-East's Linda Beck just put together a panel on the State of NY Animation, and you can read Katie Cropper's tidy summary of it at the ASIFA-East exposure sheet blog at www.asifaeast.com. The panel discussion was moderated by Linda Beck and featured Howard Beckerman, David Wachtenheim, Steve Connor, and myself.\nHoward Beckerman was his usual charming self and to record all his wisdom here would be impossible. I will say that he was a calming voice of reason, giving us example after example of how this has all happened before. He also shared some of his strategies for surviving in this fickle industry, reminding that when one door closed another always opened. In other words, when theatrical cartoons dwindled TV commercials appeared to pick up the slack.\nSteve Connor pragmatically suggested that everyone devote their efforts to making solid work on schedule and on budget and how that alone can help keep projects flowing in the Big Apple. He also suggested that even independent projects could be planned out with a better process that could be applied to making the same project with a larger crew should the project grow to a series.\nDavid Wachtenheim (of Wachtenheim/Marianetti) eloquently spoke of shrinking budgets and less commercial work floating around these days. He worried about the perception of clients, that there's a kid in his living room somewhere that can do the work cheaper and at a \"good enough\" quality.\nAfter the panel, fifty of us headed over to grab drinks at a nearby bar. While I was munching on a burger, Katie Cropper and I were discussing the evening. She told me that my message of \"make things happen, make your own luck, and work on your own projects,\" suited my personality. \"It's natural for you to do that,\" she said. And, this made me wonder just how much personality weighs in to a career. Although I would caution that what one does well often appears to others as if its effortless or simply natural.\nNo two of us are hard wired the same way. And, I think too many of us are at the mercy of our own harmful thinking. At the panel, I explained that I don't give much thought to what is going on in the economy and how it might effect NY animation. Instead, I am aware (as Howard Beckerman kept pointing out) that NY animation has always had its ups and downs. My focus is to only worry about what I can control. Therefore, I make films, I pitch shows and children's books. I look out for interesting work opportunities and am careful to nurture relationships that often lead to more work.\nDuring the panel, I told the audience that I tried to follow a smart plan as an at-home freelancer. In my current pair of freelance gigs for Sesame Workshop, I am sure to check in with the client on a regular basis to give them updates on the status of the work. Recently, they had an internal meeting to change the creative direction on one of the jobs. The producer gave me the choice of coming in for the meeting or just getting an update afterwards. For me, there was no choice. Of course I wanted to be at the meeting! Not only would attending the meeting allow me to get on the same creative page with the group, but it would also be a chance to meet with another set of folks from Sesame Workshop. I want to be more than just an anonymous freelancer uploading and downloading work. I understand that relationships are important to getting future work.\nHow much of this is based on personality and how much of this is just ol' fashioned common sense? I think it weighs heavier towards common sense. As if to provide the opposite to my story above, I heard of another animation artist who scuttled his working relationship with a new client after he came in for a meeting and then decided to bill them for it. This instantly caused a squabble and this artist was told that if he kept the charge for the meeting on his bill, they would pay it, but would not work with him again. The artist chose to be paid and kissed the relationship goodbye. Subsequently another artist got the job and worked on that particular project for almost a whole year. The industry will have its up and downs, but the greatest risk we face is making our own personal droughts.\nEach of us IS different, but better sense can be adapted by all. Personality helps and hurts in different turns and factors in to what jobs are the right and wrong fits for us. For one of my long-term flash series directing jobs, I later found out that the producers also interviewed another experienced director who had several flash series to his name, while I had none. The producers told me that they didn't hire him because he was too much of a football coach personality, while I was mellow and non-threatening. My personality helped me win that day, but this \"football coach\" director has continued on with his own great career. Clearly, he's a great fit for many employers, football coach-style and all.\nGood sense and sound judgment can be learned, but only if a person is open to learning from their own mistakes. A closed off person with an old-school \"the producers or client is always out to screw me\" attitude is not going to get far. And if they do get far, they will have had to be the most talented person in the room. That's not an option available to me, so I've always pushed other skills, learned other lessons, and kept applying them forward. The mistakes I've made can fill a book (actually, three!), which only proves that mistakes don't have to be career-killers, unless we decide that they are.\nFurthermore at the panel discussion, some wondered what will happen as India and South Korea (and others) gear up to build strong animation industries. \"They're going to take our jobs,\" many worried. I say, that's only possible if there's such a thing as \"our jobs.\" I argue that there is NOT. There are no agreed upon jobs that are ours for the taking or that can be reserved for us like a rental car. Not on an individual level, nor a city-wide level, nor a national level. We have to reach out for those jobs...to create them ourselves. There's no such thing as entitlement. Just because we decided to be journeymen animation artists doesn't mean the industry owes us squat. This can be empowering if you let it. That's how I think. Who can say I'm wrong? It's my view of the universe and it holds true in my own head, and it helps me survive and navigate this difficult industry.\nSome in the audience bemoaned NYC animation as primarily a preschool animation city. And, while many of the series have been preschool shows, there have also been older kids shows made here such as Sheep in the Big City, Codename: Kids Next Door, Kappa Mikey, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Doug, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There has also been a batch of \"adult\" or animation for tweens in the form of Beavis and Butthead, The Head, Celebrity Death Match, Daria, Downtown, Fridays, The Venture Bros., Super Jail, Assy McGee, Gary the Rat, and This Just In. This city is what we make it. If your goal is to make animation for a different audience, then the ball is in your court. If you succeed, it may not change the perception of NY animation over night, but it will be a step in a different direction. Everything is a first until it isn't. Feature animation was not a reality in this country until Disney made it happen. No British rock band had ever broken through to the American market until The Beatles. The first one through the door has a tendency to leave the door open for what comes next.\nDon't get me wrong, I don't have solid plans myself. I never have. I don't assume to know what I will be able to accomplish. I have assorted goals, but none of them have expiration dates on them. So, the only direction I have in my career is that I am going after my goals. Each day I work towards achieving them. And, I don't look at external obstacles as my problem. In my own head, the state of NY Animation is a perpetually a green traffic light.\nMonday, April 20, 2009\nWhy have I stayed in NY... instead of \"heading west young man?\" It's an interesting question to ponder, although its rare that I think about this. I never set out to be a booster of the NY animation scene. I was born here. My dad earned a terrific living as top Advertising Art director and executive (at one point he was even a vice president at Benton & Bowles), so I saw one could survive and thrive working in the commercial arts in the NY area. There was only one thing against me. No, it wasn't the anemic NY animation industry. It was my own underdeveloped talents. Spending four years at SVA didn't change that, and that was no fault to SVA. It was my own stubborn refusal to work hard enough to challenge myself. In fact, I didn't even know I had made that choice. But, choices are often made silently, aren't they?\nWhen I was privileged with the opportunity to work at Michael Sporn's studio it was both at once a rarified experience as well as typical to New York animation. Rare in that Michael's studio (then and now) tackled animation from beginning to end. No outsourcing like much of the production at MTV, Jumbo, Curious, 4Kids, Scholastic, World Leaders, (and others that have since come and gone). Here was a place to learn it all from top to bottom, because of a supportive boss like Michael and the wonderful staff that followed his lead. I soon had the opportunity to try my hand at storyboards, designs, animation, writing...all within the two year period I worked at his studio.\nWhile this would have indeed been rare to get this variety of experience at some NY studios in such a short amount of time, it WAS representative of a key an aspect of NY animation. Namely; flexibility. Getting to do different things on different projects. That's something I have never taken for granted. It still tickles me that I get to do that.\nNo, I'm not a character designer in the Phil Rynda sense (he is amazing, by the way.) Just check out http://philrynda.blogspot.com/\nBut, by being in NYC animation I get design opportunties just the same. I recently whipped out the above 3 designs after sesame workshop hired me to animate a 30 second spot. They wanted to see lots of different design approaches so I spent two or three days exploring some possible styles. They loved one particular design (not shown above) so much that they asked me to just animate that character as it was drawn. These fun little gigs, they seem very \"NYC animation\" to me. It's part of our blend of the independent and the commercial. Michael Sporn, his disciples, and those of the other NY botique-style animation studios (Buzzco, JJs, Asterisk, Wachtenheim and Marianetti, etc) are the true face of NY animation. They are the survivors that remain as the big studios come and go.\nSo, in NY animation we find ourselves with a happy problem. What to call oneself? Am I a director? A filmmaker? A designer? A writer? An author? A teacher? An animator? A jack of all trades but a master of none? To some, I'm simply the president of ASIFA-East. But, in NY animation, one doesn't have to choose one label. And, by some absurd turn of fate, this formerly raw SVA graduate is now paid to do all of these things (well, except the president of ASIFA-East thing). Why have I stayed in NY? Where else could one have such a career? And, best of all, I could list more than a hundred people just like me. Only chances are, they will be better designers.\nMonday, April 13, 2009\nI have been an adjunct teacher since 2003. That was the year that Richard O'Connor recommended me to Parsons School of Design to temporarily take over a class he was teaching. I was deep in my \"land of milk and honey\" Blue's Clue's job, which turned out to be almost 8 years of end-to-end employment. Back then, I wasn't hurting for money, and it would have been very easy to turn the teaching down. Most of my colleagues weren't teaching on the side. A small handful were. Teaching is something that had always been on my personal fear list and therefore it was something I had to do. If something is a new experience, it's probably something useful. In fact, animation producer Tina Moglia just told my career class that her only factor to stay on a job is, \"Am I learning anything?\"\nSo, how do you get an opportunity to teach? First of all, work in the industry. Local schools such as Parsons, Pratt, SVA, and NYU don't require that an adjunct teacher have a Master's degree or even a Bachelor's degree. You only need to be a working professional and that includes most of us! The next thing to do is to be an active member of the animation community. Let others see you running events, making films, and volunteering for organization's like ASIFA-East. This will grow your profile and show that you are reliable and able to juggle multiple tasks. Thirdly, tell animation teachers you know that you're interested in teaching. Current teachers are often the first ones to hear about positions opening. Usually, current teachers get a crack at the first new opportunities, but not all of them are a good fit, and many times a teacher will be able to pass the lead on to their contacts. Lastly, you can also try to set up a meeting with the head of the school's animation department and present yourself as a potential teacher.\nThe interesting thing about teaching one class is that it tends to mushroom into several classes, perhaps even spread over different schools. Just six months after taking on my first class at Parsons, Machi Tantillo recommended that I take over her Animation Career class at SVA. It was the class that inadvertently launched me as an author when my class plan spun off for the book, Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive (Allworth Press). A couple of years later, John Canemaker brought me in as temporary teacher at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, at which I will return to teach a pair of classes this year. School's like to give multiple classes to teachers that are already proven commodities, which only makes sense. But, new teachers crack through every so often, so try to make yourself one of the success stories by following the plan above.\nThe income that my first class brought in (teaching one 15-week class pays about $3,000) wasn't something I needed in 2003. But, it sure helped me in 2004 when I returned to the freelance life for 10 months, and again in 2007 to the present day when I became a full-time at-home freelancer. Income-wise, teaching has become a life-line, a guaranteed check that I can count on. It represents the very least amount of money I can make in a tough year such as 2009. The other nice thing about teaching is how it flexible it can be. Many times, the teacher can suggest a day and time that works best for them. When possible, I try to do most of my teaching at 6 PM classes, and that way when I have a full time in-house job, the class won't interfere.\nMost of all, I really appreciate the way teaching puts me into contact with the upcoming generations of animation artists. It's inspiring to see the work they do and then to see them achieving success in the industry upon graduation. Its nice to know that, as a teacher, you had some small part in that. Not all the work an animation artist takes on in a career is work we can feel proud of...but, I find teaching has always been a rewarding experience. It's become a vital part of my career cocktail. Its the lime in my gin and tonic. A small part, but one the makes a big contribution to the whole.\nMonday, April 6, 2009\n*Note: image above from Janet Perlman's film, HotSeat.\nI never know what will touch a nerve in my SVA animation career class. So, I was very pleased when a healthy debate erupted based on the \"Desktop Dilemma\" section of Chapter 7 in my book, \"Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive.\" Assuming you have the book (I can dream, can't I?), I'll give you a minute to look that section up. In short, it was a cautionary tale of how an animation artist could damage his reputation by adorning his wall space and desktop computer with swim suit models and scantily clad teen starlets.\nLook at any studio's animation cubicles and offices and you'll find personal items such as posters, toys, family photos, doodles, and other decorations at most every workstation. The stuff we surround ourselves with projects an image. Its a public display of our tastes, humor, and personality. But, how much should one share at the workplace? Even when it comes to the creative workspaces in this industry?\nIn response to the \"Desktop Dilemma\" story above, one female class member explained that if she sees pictures in the workplace that objectify woman, it feels like a personal attack. It makes her feel as if she is being looked at as a sexual object around the office.\nThe particulars of office culture comes into play when trying to understand this complicated issue. A preschool series tends to have young children, mothers, child development specialists, and female network executives walking through the office on a regular basis. Its easy to understand why it would not be desirable to have anything potentially offensive on display.\nOne male student objected and felt that the images described in \"Desktop Dilemma\" were not offensive to him... and, besides, another studio in town that animates edgy adult swim and comedy central series' had much worse on their walls. The difference, I explained, was that the edgy studio was an independent company, set up to reflect the taste and personality of its owner. For some, that might be reason enough to not want to work there. Not everyone is the right fit for every situation. And, on the male students first point (he did not understand what was offensive about swimsuit pictures), I told him the issue wasn't his personal definition of what was offensive. Instead, the point is to be sensitive that somebody else \"might\" take offense.\nI'm not sure I got this point across either. Later that night (after class), a trusted friend suggested that for men that didn't understand what could be offensive about female swimsuit pictures posted at the office,...maybe they would understand it in other terms that might be offensive to them. There's a long list of potentially offensive material that I wouldn't recommend displaying in the workplace: images that are racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, homophobic, etc. Think of the what might offend you and understand that there are some women who might be offended by your sports illustrated swim suit calendar or copies of Maxim magazine.\nThe bottom line is that the office, desk, chairs, stapler, computers, and walls, are not your property. You are only keeping the seat warm for the length of time you are on a project. You are working in someone else's home in a highly collaborative process staffed by men and women of all kinds.\nI tried one last time to reach this male student. I asked him, \"Is it worth the risk of harming your reputation to prove a point that you're entitled to express yourself no-matter-what the circumstances? Not quite sure if this was understood either, I asked, \"What are your goals on a job? Are you there to conduct a sociological experiment to determine what percent of a staff might be offended by your wall-hangings?...Or, are you there to be an animation artist working in harmony with the rest of the team?", "id": "<urn:uuid:af3f2529-c626-409a-8e68-50644b3a6d39>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://animondays.blogspot.com/2009_04_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9817075133323669, "token_count": 4288, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "This is the second article in a four-part series . . .\nI cannot emphasize this point enough, so get ready. I REALLY like it when everything goes my way. I have to admit it feels good just to see those words in print, think about what they mean, and envision instances in the past where it has happened. Living a favored life . . . seems like it would be the be-all end-all of what would end up being a truly wonderful life.\nNow there is a favored lifestyle I think any one of us could get used to. I have read of Presidents past and First Ladies too, who have noted that lifestyle as one of the greatest perks of being in that office. Everything kept spotless, great food prepared by world-class chefs, beautiful art and artifacts, wonderfully appointed rooms and furniture, and on and on and on the list goes.

How cool is all that!?!\nEverywhere you go the roads and/or the sky is cleared, and people make way. While we may not get to have that life, we do try in our own ways. We get the best house we can, the best car we can afford, and whatever else we think will make us happy in this life. We accumulate these things around us, and consider ourselves blessed with what we have. Granted, some people are of meager means and do the best they can with what they have, while others can afford quite a bit more, but in the end, we all eventually become used to whatever life we have. We content ourselves and call ourselves blessed and highly favored, and there is nothing wrong with that.\nExcept . . . we are not here to live a favored life.\nA whole lot of Christian men will have gone to church this past Sunday. Some wear really nice clothes while others simply wear the best clothes they have. They carry their Bible under their arm, a smile on their face, shake hands and make small-talk with everyone they meet, keep the kids in line, and sit with their wife. They stand up and sit down at all the right times, sing when it is time, listen attentively to the preacher, and when it is all said and done, they go home. They love their church, their pastor, and consider themselves blessed and highly favored, and there is nothing wrong with that.\nExcept . . . we are not here to live a favored life.\nAgain, let me repeat and be very clear. There is NOTHING WRONG with having things in this life. There is not a single “thou shalt not” when it comes to having a nice home, a nice car, nice clothes, and whatever else there is in this life. There is no commandment against having and living a favored life, however, when that becomes the focus and reason for living, that is when things get off-line.\nLuke 12:16 “And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. 20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?”\nThere is a time for the favored life. Where would a baby be without the favored life? However, every child must grow up. The favored life is not something we should seek to keep permanent. Understanding that all belongs to God and that everything God has given us should be used in His service, then we begin to see a greater purpose for the things we have in this life.\nClinging to the Favored Christian life is not God’s plan or purpose for your life. When things get just a little “out of favor” how do you respond? Do you find yourself asking, “What’s wrong, Lord?!” “Why me!?!” Do you try to hold on to the favored life you are living? When things go “wrong” do you try to make them “right” again according to the life you want? Is God trying to teach you or show you something? What if there is something greater than the Favored Christian life to be had?\nReposted from www.MenRising.com\nThis is the first article in a four-part series . . .\nWhen does a man truly fail? What makes a failure complete?\nI remember being a young man truly afraid of getting my report card. I was six years old and in first grade, and I had no idea how grades came to appear on the report card or what they were based on other than someone else's idea of whether or not I had \"done well in school\" for some time period. The report card came in small yellow envelopes of the kind you'd find in most offices when something official needs to be transported from here to there. I remember carrying mine home with a heavy hand.\nI suddenly recounted all the things I had been in trouble for up to that point . . . throwing rocks in the playground . . . spitting water when it was my turn for a drink at the water fountain . . . not staying in line when walking between the classroom and the playground . . . and on and on it went. When I handed my report card to my mother, she began to read down the list of topics I had only heard in the classroom, and was not sure exactly what they meant. Reading - A, Math - A, Penmanship - A (there was a ship?!) and when she came to the bottom of the list I had gotten all A's.\nGlad that was over with, I simply went on my way. The next report card, however, did not come back so good. I had a B and a C, and although I was not sure what that meant, I knew from my dad's reaction that it was not good. The third report card came back with an F on it, and that is when my dad took me into the back room for a talk.\nIs the letter \"F\" for \"Failure\", stamped anywhere on your life? Unfortunately, many Christians have this letter stamped on their life, and not by God, but either by themselves or even more unfortunately, by other Christians. The failed Christian life happens when we do what we know is wrong, but it's not merely getting out of line at the water fountain. It can be much worse.\nInfidelity in a marriage is the biggest one that springs to my mind because it seems to be the most abhorrent and prevalent in churches. However, there are other ways to get the big \"F\" stamped onto your life. For some, it is simply failing to meet expectations. Whether you set them or had them placed on your life, a broken expectation can feel so much like a broken promise that disappoints those around us. However you get it, chances are high that you may be walking around with an \"F\" stamped on your Christian life. The worst thing about it is it feels permanently engraved there.\nHow do you know a man has accepted that mark? He stops going to church. He stops reading his Bible. He may even stop trying to talk with God. \"God cannot use me\" is the message in his heart, and that message can be reinforced in cruel ways by others.\nBack to my questions: When does a man truly fail? What makes a failure complete?\nThrough the year of first grade, I was able to bring my grades back up. The lower grades turned back into B's and A's. In the end, I was no failure. I still had the marks of the past to show for the lack of performance, but it was in the past. The only mark that mattered was the one at the end of the year. The only way that mark of an \"F\" would have been my undoing is if I had ceased to try. If I had accepted the \"F\" as permanent the moment it appeared, that would have been my moment of real failure.\nToo many Christians today live the Failed Christian life, not because of the mark of Failure, but because they have accepted that mark as permanent, and have stopped trying. What is more, there are too many other Christians out there all too ready to remind them of the mark. Though life has moved on, they continue to point their finger into the past - \"Failure\" is on their lips every time they say hello, and the engraving grows a little deeper.\nWe do not have to live the Failed Christian life though. All we have to do is keep trying. Peter fell beneath the waves, cut off a man's ear, denied Christ three times, and still lived a very successful Christian life . . . because he understood . . . a man only truly fails when he fails to keep trying. Then, his failure is complete.\nReposted from www.MenRising.com\n“Humble me, Lord.” How different would your Christian walk and spiritual life be if you prayed that prayer every day and meant it? What would it look like if God were to humble you?\nTwo stories stick out in my mind when it comes to humility, and both of them have to do with tanks. The first story comes from a soldier on the battle field of World War One, called The Great War at the time (there had not yet been a World War II), tanks were just really beginning to come into their own as a tool on the battlefield. Before tanks, armies would line up on either side, and dig in with mazes of trenches with barb wire and machine gun nests. In between them was “No Man’s Land” which was a space of land neither side held, and where both sides had equal access to fire the full force of their weapons.\nWhen the tank came along, it changed all that. As a soldier recalled his first encounter with a tank, he said the experience was both terrifying and humbling. All the prepared defenses were useless. The tank rolled through No Man’s Land, through the machine gun fire, over the barbed wire, and caved in the trenches on top of the men who were underneath. Lines of soldiers followed, and his unit was in an immediate state if disarray.\nThe second story takes me back to June 4, 1989. In Beijing China, in a plaza called Tian-an-men Square, students rose up in protest, and were fired upon and killed by Chinese government forces. At one point, after much of the square has been cleared, tanks begin to roll into the square. A single column of tanks grinds to a halt, not because of overwhelming opposition, but because one single man resolved to block them or be overrun, stands in their way.\nAs he stands there, the tanks rolling directly up to him, I am the one humbled. He stands there in protest, and we can only assume because of the events preceding he is there on behalf of the Chinese students previously murdered by their own government. In my mind, he also personifies humility in the sense that he has come to the point that, in his own mind, he has given up everything. Had he any reservation within himself for himself or the things he owned on this earth, doubtless he would not have been there, yet there he stood.\nI wonder how many Christians would be willing to make such a stand. Too many times, even I admit I am too preoccupied with the things of this world, trying to hold onto the status quo of my own life, trying to do the day-to-day things that make ends meet, and sometimes I forget what my real mission in life is as a Christian. It is worth remembering these stories, because if we pray “Humble me, Lord” it may just happen that God sends a tank over the defensive lines in our lives we have so carefully prepared, so that we may hold no thing on this earth in reserve in a stand for Him.\nHow different would your life be if you sincerely prayed, “Humble me, Lord” every day?\n- reposed from www.MenRising.com\nDoes God fail? A better question might be, has God ever failed you? As Christian men, our knee jerk reaction may be something along the lines of “God never fails” or “God has never failed me.” I am not here to argue the point, because I would agree with you, however, the way we live our lives sometimes testifies differently than what we have proclaimed with our mouths.\nI do not know anyone who has not been affected by the economic turmoil these days. If you have not been personally affected, then you know someone who has. Statistically speaking, it would be impossible for you not to fall into one of those two categories because of the immensity of the problem. Does God know about it? Does God understand how it is affecting you or someone you know? Has God failed? Has God failed you?\nWho is your God?\nIs your God someone you can count on or not?\nIn times of greatest distress, I think many of us wonder if we can still count on God. It is the reality of being human. There is a circle of people out there with a very cynical view of God, but their wondering and musing can be helpful when we ask the question, “Who is your God?” I was watching TV the other night when a guy came on asking the question, “Is God in control of everything or not?” As I listened, he began to cite the many things that are attributed to the work of God, such as tsunamis and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.\nHe then assumed that, well yes, God is in control of all those things. Because God, being all powerful could have prevented any of them, yet for whatever reason, chose not to do so. Without missing a beat, he then cited God for all the other tragedies in the world, and ended with God giving aids to babies in Africa. Whatever your reaction to these accusations of God, that is the perception of God to people who refuse to believe God exists. It begs the question: who is your God?\nI am reminded by the words of a goodie but oldie hymn called “A Mighty Fortress.” For those who have never heard of it, here is the first stanza of that song:\nA mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;\nour helper he amid the flood of mortal ills prevaling.\nFor still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;\nhis craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate,\non earth is not his equal.\nWhat those who choose to not believe in God will never understand is that while Christians may never be able to prove to their satisfaction that God is real, there is great peace and power in accepting and knowing that God does exist. God does care, and while we may not understand the tragedies in the vapor of existence we call life, we know that God has never failed us, and that God never fails.\nIsaiah 14:24 “The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:”\nReposted from www.MenRising.com\nSuppose I gave you a jar of yellow gumballs with this simple instruction: you are to separate one gumball from the rest without isolating it from the others. Could you do it? As soon as you take one gumball out of the bunch, it is separated, but now it is also isolated. As soon as you put it back in, it once again becomes neither separated or isolated.\nCan something or someone be separated without being isolated? It is a question worth asking because it drives at the core of the meaning of holiness. As Christians are we to be a holy, separated people, or are we to be a holy, isolated people?\nHow you look at your Christian life through either of these two possibilities will determine how you relate to the world around you. From two different pastors I heard the following two statements: “Church is not for the saved, it is for the lost to come and hear the Gospel” and “Church is not for the lost, it is for the saved to come and learn how to live a life pleasing to God.” As I took in and thought over these two statements, I could not see anything wrong with either of them except for their exclusive stance toward a particular group. In truth, church should be for the saved AND the lost.\nThe church should be a place where the lost feel welcome and where the Gospel can be planted in their hearts, however, it should also be a place where Christians feel comfortable bringing their families because they know that the teachings will help all of them learn to live a holy life pleasing to God.\nGoing back to the example of the gumballs, what if you were to take one gumball out, change it’s color, and then place it back in the jar. Would it then be separated? Well, it would certainly be different, and it would stand out. It would also no longer be isolated.\n1Peter 2:9 “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:” John 9:5 “As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”\nIf we are in the world and no different than the world, then I propose that we are not separated, or to use another word, holy. To be holy is to be different in a way that gives honor and glory to God instead of bringing attention to ourselves. If we are so different that we isolate ourselves, and the world has no interaction with us, then they cannot see God in us in that way either. We may as well be a gumball wrapped in opaque packaging completely cut-of from any interaction, definitely separated, but also just another form of isolation.\nThere must be balance. We cannot hope to influence a lost world if we isolate ourselves from them, nor can we be the light to a world if we are no different than they are. That balance, that distinction between being separated and isolated, that characteristic that points to God instead of ourselves, that is what I believe is holiness.\nReposted from www.MenRising.com", "id": "<urn:uuid:66dea464-c1fd-4299-93fa-2bfb5f4cf633>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://annistonstar.com/pages/blogs_faithandfamily/push?per_page=5&class=&rel=prev&x_page=14&instance=gamecock", "date": "2013-05-18T08:04:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9790070056915283, "token_count": 3983, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "By Jim Hopf\nOwners of the (556 MW) Kewaunee nuclear plant in Wisconsin recently announced that they will be closing the plant, because it was losing money and they were unable to find another company willing to buy it.\nThe reason the plant is losing money is that it is in a “merchant” power market, in which the price of electricity is governed by the cost of electricity from natural gas plants (those plants being the last, highest-variable cost, incremental supplier). Due to the current very low cost of natural gas, as well as weak demand due to a sluggish economy, the market price for electricity in those regions is very low. On top of this is the fact that small, one-unit plants like Kewaunee have relatively high operating costs, since many costs (including many of those associated with regulatory compliance, site security, etc.) do not scale down with plant size.\nUnfortunately, it is possible that Kewaunee may not be the last plant to close for purely economic reasons. Many experts are saying that several other small plants in merchant power markets (including Vermont Yankee, Fitzpatrick, Nine Mile Point, Cooper, Ginna, Indian Point, and Clinton) are at risk of closing, due to weak demand and continuing low natural gas prices.\nIn addition to plants that may close for economic reasons, a few other reactors will or may close due to equipment problems. Based on estimates of $2–$3 billion to repair the Crystal River plant’s containment dome, Duke decided to close the Florida plant. Low natural gas prices almost certainly factored into that decision.\nMeanwhile, the San Onofre plant in California has been offline for over a year due to tube failures in recently-installed steam generators that were based on a new design (that turned out to be problematic). Apparently (and surprisingly) it will take 4-6 years for new stream generators “that could pass regulatory muster” to be fabricated and installed. The utility is seeking Nuclear Regulatory Commission permission to run one of the two idled reactors at 70% power, based on analyses that show additional tube wear will not occur under those conditions.\nLow gas prices likely temporary\nAlthough many voices are saying that low natural gas prices (not much higher than current levels of $3–$4 per million BTU) will last for a long time, there are many reasons why this is unlikely to be true. The four main reasons are summarized below:\n- The price of natural gas is 4-6 times lower than that of oil, on a per unit energy (BTU) basis. Given that oil and gas are interchangeable for many uses/applications, such a difference in energy-equivalent price is unsustainable. In fact, plans are underway, as we speak, to use natural gas in the transport sector, mainly for large trucks and fleet vehicles. There are also plans to build Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) refineries that convert natural gas into clean diesel fuel.\n- The price of US natural gas ($3-$4/MBTU) is a factor of 3 to 4 times lower than what gas (LNG) sells for abroad, with Europe paying over $12/MBTU and Japan/Asia currently paying over $16/MBTU for LNG imports. Plans to export US gas are being made as we speak. Such exports will even out worldwide gas prices, and lead to significantly higher US prices.\n- The price of natural gas is very sensitive to the balance between supply and demand, and demand should increase measurably in the coming years as the economy recovers.\n- Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the current price of natural gas is actually much lower than the raw cost of gas production for most US shale fields. This is clearly unsustainable. In fact, there has recently been a major shift in drilling activity (and drilling equipment) from gas to oil, since oil production is so much more profitable, given the much higher price for oil. Given the high decline rates for shale gas wells, any let up in exploration or the drilling of new wells will soon lead to declining production.\nIn addition to the above four reasons is the likelihood that increased (tightened) requirements will be placed on shale drilling operations, either by the Environmental Protection Agency or the states themselves, in order to protect groundwater and reduce air pollution. Such requirements would also result in somewhat higher production costs. Of course, if a price or limit on CO2 emissions is ever imposed, it would make existing nuclear plants more competitive vs. gas plants. Finally, it must be noted that new EPA pollution regulations are leading to a significant number of coal plant closures. Most of this coal capacity will be replaced by gas generation. The resultant increase in US gas demand will also put upward pressure on gas prices.\nGiven this, it seems likely that the unprofitability of the nuclear plants in question will be temporary; probably only a few years. For this reason, many nuclear plant owners (e.g., Exelon) have stated that they are not currently planning to close any plants. Thus, some of the plants listed earlier may not close, despite a negative short term situation. Given the likely short term nature of the situation, any such closures would be very unfortunate, and shortsighted.\nCan anything be done?\nThe closure of nuclear plants like Kewaunee and Crystal River will have a devastating effect on the local economy, due to lost local jobs and a greatly reduced local tax base. As a result, some political efforts are being made to avoid closure. In Kewaunee’s case, a local legislator is proposing that nuclear qualify under the state’s renewable (or clean energy) portfolio standard. Depending on the details, and their design, however, many such proposals may not provide the assistance that the plant needs to remain open. As stated by the Kewaunee utility, what the plant really needed was a long-term power purchase agreement at an adequate price.\nIt would seem that the best solution would be to develop a means to either support the price or reduce operating costs, over the next few years, or somehow arrange (or incentivise) a power purchase agreement that would last for at least a few years.\nPower price supports\nOne option would be for the government (federal, state, or local) to provide a minor level of price support for the plant’s power, with the understanding that such support would be only temporary (i.e., a few years). Given the current financial state of the federal government, any such support may be unlikely. However, given the negative local impacts of the plants’ closures, it may be in lower-level governments’ interest to offer some limited support, if it were enough to keep the plants open. Such governments would have to weigh the cost of any support against the permanent loss of local employment and tax base. The situation is analogous to how local areas offer economic incentives to attract large employers in the first place.\nAs for how a “price support” would work, one could take a cue from the support given to renewable energy over the years. Such government support has often taken the form of above market prices paid to renewable suppliers, or using “renewable energy certificates” to attain a renewable generation goal, and allowing renewable generators to sell those certificates (at a price determined by the market). In one way or another, the (local) government would pay off the difference between the market price for power and an agreed-upon price that the plant needs.\nAnother option would be to arrange for some type of power purchase agreement. Either the government would add some type of incentive for a private power consumer to enter into such an agreement with the plant, at least for a few years, or the government itself could enter into such a power purchase agreement with the plant. If the government’s own power demand is not large enough to use all the plant’s output, it could sell off any remaining power to private consumers at market rates (presumably at some loss to the government, that is, until gas prices go back up).\nMany may say that such measures would be too expensive, that governments can’t afford it, or that any such interventions in the free market are not justified. It seems to me that the support these plants need is smaller in both magnitude and duration than the support that has been given to many renewable energy projects, in the form of operating subsidies or mandates for their use, regardless of cost (with power consumers being forced to pay the higher costs).\nIn terms of securing cost-stable, reliable, domestic, pollution-free, CO2-free base load generation for the long term, these may be among the most cost effective measures ever taken. In addition to preserving local employment and tax base, they would reduce the region’s vulnerability to natural gas price swings/spikes in the future. Call it a (temporary) subsidy on all (new or existing) emissions-free generation. It should be easier to justify than much larger renewable generation subsidies.\nAnother option for keeping plants in operation would be measures to reduce their operating costs (or at least prevent them from increasing) for at least the next few years. Such measures could be removed in a few years, after the market price for power has recovered, and the plants can afford higher costs.\nOne example would be to delay any expensive Fukushima-related upgrades for plants that are currently barely profitable or (temporarily) unprofitable. After a several-year grace period, the plant would be required to make the upgrades. If the market price for power has still not recovered (due to gas prices not going up), then the plant would close if the upgrades would render it unprofitable.\nAs I discussed in my last post, requirements that result in the closure of nuclear plants, and their replacement by fossil-fueled generation (even gas) does not reduce public health and environmental risks; it actually increases them. Also, it’s not as though there is no precedent for such policies. After the Clean Air Act passed in 1970, the coal industry managed to get many (if not most) of its existing plants exempted (grandfathered) from the new law’s much stricter requirements. The argument was that it would not make economic sense to retrofit old plants that would only be operating for a few more years anyway. It turns out that they kept operating those older plants (whose emissions of various pollutants are many, many times that allowed by the 1970 Clean Air Act) for 40 more years, and counting….\nNote how there is no such thing as a “grandfather clause” for the nuclear industry, with respect to Fukushima upgrades or requirements in general (anything that NRC thinks is important). At a minimum, backfits are required if justified by cost-benefit analysis (something that is not required for grandfathered coal plants, where the benefits of CAA-mandated pollution controls greatly exceed any costs). Another difference is the fact that the overall public health and environmental risk/harm from the grandfathered coal plants is orders of magnitude larger than any from a nuclear plant without Fukushima upgrades (especially given the lack of earthquake and tsunami potential at all the sites in question).\nOn a more general note, with respect to Fukushima, I definitely agree that many intelligent, cost-effective measures should be taken in response to the lessons learned from the event. However, we’ve also learned that even a worst-case plant accident event (with multiple meltdowns followed by essentially a failure of containment) caused no deaths and is projected to have no measurable health impact. In other words, the public health impacts are FAR smaller than what had been previously assumed, as the basis for current regulatory policy. Given this, while I agree that some specific upgrades should be made in response to Fukushima, I’m wondering what requirements we should also consider paring back, given the much smaller potential impacts. Are any new cost-benefit analyses being performed?\nTo my knowledge, the NRC isn’t considering taking any steps in that direction. This is unfortunate, since some carefully-considered, strategic paring of certain requirements could possibly prevent plant closures, and may make nuclear more competitive in general, resulting in reduced use of (harmful) fossil fuels in the future. (Note that this would not be analogous to EPA relaxing pollution requirements so that coal plants could remain open, in that any replacement generation for old coal plants would be environmentally superior, whereas when a nuclear plant closes, its [fossil] replacement is environmentally inferior.)\nIn a similar vein, aside from Fukushima upgrades, one could explore other ways to reduce operating costs at small, vulnerable plants. Apparently, the operating cost for some of these plants (e.g., Ginna) is $40/MWh; much higher than the under $20/MWh operating cost that I was always told applies to existing nuclear plants. This must be due, in part, to their small size and single-unit nature. That said, one still has to ask why their operating costs are so high. I’m guessing that their staffing, per MW, is extremely high; higher than most nuclear plants and much higher than that of fossil plants (the 556 MW Kewaunee plant employed 655 people). In my personal opinion, the industry (e.g., INPO), Kewaunee plant operators, and the NRC should sit down and figure out why the staffing (and operating costs) are so high, and try to figure out a responsible way to reduce them. At least that much effort should be made to keep these plants open, given the impacts on the local economy and the long-term impacts on the environment, energy costs, and energy security. The industry needs to make more of an effort on this.\nThe Kewaunee plant is only ~5 miles from the larger, two-unit Point Beach nuclear plant. Both are pressurized water reactors. One question I have is why the plants could not be effectively managed and operated like a three-unit site, given the proximity. Are there any jobs/tasks at Kewaunee that could be handled by Point Beach personnel, or vice versa? I realize that this would result in staff reductions and lost jobs, but losing some jobs is better than losing them all. I also wonder if Kewaunee plant staff considered any wage/benefits concessions, or if management considered offering them before closing the plant and laying everyone off.\nOne other option for temporarily unprofitable plants would be to mothball them for a few years, then reopen them when the market price for power recovers. The problem is that, due to various requirements (regulatory, etc.), it’s expensive to maintain a shutdown nuclear plant. If the owners give up the operating license, and switch over to a (“possession only”) license that applies to a decommissioned reactor state, it would be very expensive to gain permission to restart the plant. As a result, no nuclear plant that has been formally shutdown has ever been restarted.\nThis is one more thing that seems to be unique to the nuclear industry. Restarting a coal plant is much easier. In fact, while coal’s percentage of US generation has fallen from ~50% to ~32% over the last year or so, due to very low gas prices, utilities (e.g., Southern) have stated that they will switch many of those coal plants right back on once natural gas prices recover (i.e., once it is even slightly less expensive to run the coal plant, regardless of the much greater level of pollution). Some disincentive to pollute, which would at least raise the natural gas price at which utilities would switch old, highly-polluting coal plants back on, is clearly needed.\nThis is another area where some review of current policies is in order, in my opinion. As things stand, it is far too difficult and expensive to pull a closed nuclear plant back out of mothballs, and/or to maintain a plant in a “mothballed” state. I don’t really understand why maintaining the option of restarting a nuclear plant should make it that much more expensive to maintain a plant in a shutdown state. It’s not as though the risks and potential for release (from stored spent fuel, etc..) are any greater. Reform/scrutiny in this area should be more palatable than my earlier suggestions about paring requirements for operating plants, given the lower potential risks present during the long-term shutdown state.\nAnyway, mothballing the plant is another option that should be studied by the local governments, the utility, and the NRC. If local governments want to keep the option of restarting the plant, they should try to find a way to make it happen (i.e., make it worthwhile for the utility).\nCrystal River and San Onofre\nUnlike plants like Kewaunee, the Crystal River plant is probably a lost cause given the (inexplicably) huge cost of repairing its containment dome. I still have to ask why no cost-benefit analysis is being done on the option of operating the plant in its current state. (It’s likely that the costs of repair greatly exceed any public health or economic risk reduction benefits.) I also feel compelled to point out that even if the plant were operated in its current (unrepaired) state, its overall risk to public health and the environment in the local area would be much smaller than that posed by the four coal units at the same site, that are going to continue to operate.\nAs for San Onofre, I am not sure what “that pass regulatory muster” means. Does it refer to installing generators of the old design, or does it refer to years of analysis (paralysis)? I have to ask why it will take 4–6 years to replace the steam generators (a piece of industrial heat exchange equipment). Does the replacement of large heat exchangers in any other industry take anywhere near this long?\nAlso, news reports are saying that the NRC is having some problem allowing the plant (steam generator?) to run at 70% because 100% was the design basis. I’m having trouble understanding how legal (licensing) issues could be a significant impediment. The engineering issues, i.e., the assertion that the steam generators can operate at that power level without further tube degradation, clearly need to be analyzed, but they should (expeditiously) perform the necessary engineering evaluations and move on.\nWhatever these issues are, the NRC (and the utility) need to do what it takes to resolve them, in months not years. This is especially true given that to make up for the loss of San Onofre’s generation, they are firing up two old, dirty fossil units in the area; units that had been retired due to the fact that they did not meet current air pollution requirements, among other factors. Thus, the longer they delay, the greater the (real) impacts on public health in the region (as well as CO2 emissions) from those fossil units.\nIs this beginning to sound like a theme? Going to the ends of the earth to avoid/reduce small nuclear risks, and ignoring much larger risks from fossil generation; fossil generation that is often being used to replace nuclear generation that is closed due to the relentless quest to reduce nuclear risks to zero.\nJim Hopf is a senior nuclear engineer with more than 20 years of experience in shielding and criticality analysis and design for spent fuel dry storage and transportation systems.

{"text": "Written by County Comptroller Howard S. Weitzman Thursday, 04 June 2009 15:34\nHealthcare issues have always been at the forefront of my policy initiatives, both as County Comptroller and during the 35 years spent in the healthcare field. Throughout my two terms, I have been a squeaky wheel when it comes to finding ways to trim the escalating costs of Nassau County’s health benefits. Several years ago I persuaded the County Legislature to eliminate the practice of offering two family health benefit policies to one family, to lengthen the number of years of employment required to vest lifetime retiree health benefits and to increase the health benefit buy back amount to encourage employees with other coverage options to drop County health benefits.\nLast year County Executive Tom Suozzi and I released a report showing that the New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) was over-collecting premiums from local governments and had accumulated an excessive $540 million on top of statutory reserves. The State agreed and applied some of the excessive premium to keep the 2009 rate increase to an average 1 percent, instead of the 7 percent originally forecasted by NYSHIP. This effort saved Nassau County taxpayers approximately $11 million in health insurance premiums for 2009 and approximately $116 million for local schools and governments. I will also be working to recoup a portion of the excess NYSHIP premiums charged in prior years – an amount equal to $540 million statewide and $21 million for Nassau County, that could be made as a one month premium holiday for all NYSHIP participants. The vast majority of Nassau’s schools and local governments also participate in NYSHIP.\nRecently I received an appointment to the New York State Health Insurance Program Participating Agency Advisory Council (PAAC). This is good news for taxpayers because now I will have the ear of the people who make the policies. Nassau County is the largest local government participating agency in NYSHIP and prior to my appointment, no one from Nassau County had served on the board! The Council also includes representatives from other participating agencies, such as local school districts. Nassau County Director of Risk Management John Brooks was also named to the PAAC.\nAs a member of this council I will continue my call (and the use of my squeaky wheel) for an outside review of NYSHIP because I believe there are many more opportunities for savings and I look forward to serving Nassau County.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2c4e23a0-636a-4ec2-8720-2d30e8ff4ec8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://antonnews.com/plainviewoldbethpageherald/opinion/820-comptrollers-report-june-5-2009.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:25:07Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9623841047286987, "token_count": 487, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "What's... this? A guest post?\nHello! I know most of you come to this blog to read about quilting, and stuff like that, but this time you're in store for something a little different.\nMy name is Lauren, and I'm Sarah's daughter. I'm fourteen years old, and I know next to nothing about quilting. Not nothing.... I mean, I've lived with a quilter my entire life. But certainly not enough to write a blog post on the subject. So instead, I decided to write about my mom! That's the natural thing to do... right?\nSo here goes nothing....\n14 Relatively Unknown Things About My Mom\n1.She's really crazy and funny when she wants you to take cough medicine.\nI've had a cold for about two weeks now. It's no fun. The medicine I have to take is absolutely revolting. I hate it . It's nasty stuff. It usually takes me a little while to pshych myself up to drink the stuff. One night, Mom and I were standing in the kitchen while I was trying to take my meds. It was late, it was cold, and mom didn't want to be there much longer. So, in an effort to hurry me along in the process of drinking that horrible liquid, she started to motivate me by saying : \" Up and..... BACK! Down the....... HATCH!!!\"\n2. If she hurts herself, she must show you ... repeatedly.\nNot just once or twice, oh no.\nEvery chance she gets.\nBecause she wants you to feel bad for her. And of course you do, but after being shown her injury twenty times....\n3. She sometimes yells at people when she's driving.\nYes, I realize that lots of people do this.\nMom doesn't say anything bad.\nShe says things like \" Get out of the way B-hole!\" then she turns to me,\n\" That b-hole better get outta the way!\"\nShe actually says \" B-hole\" . Not butt hole, she'd never say that.\nOkay, maybe she would.\n4. She's the only mom who stays to watch us at dance.\nMy sister and I dance quite a bit. I have dance five days a week now. Needless to say, we're at the dance studio a good amount of time. Mom's out there everyday, sitting on the bench, cross stitching in hand, watching us dance. None of the other moms are ever there. They don't watch their kids dance. I mean, sure, they're there sometimes. But no one has yet to come close to spending as much time at the dance studio as mom does.\n5. Any story from her childhood is set in third grade.\nOkay, so not any story.\nBut a good chunk of them. So much of them... almost all of them. Her stories usually go a little something like this\nMom:\" One time when I was a kid....\"\nMe: \" Was this in third grade?\"\nMom: \" ......Yes.\"\n6. She is obsessed with Thor.\nYou know ,Thor.\nThe mythical Norse god of thunder.\nShe doesn't just like Thor... she has a Thor doll, a Thor pez dispenser, and lots of other assorted Thor goodies.Of course she does.\n7. She's always watching old movies.\nAlways. It bothered me a bit when I was little... but they've started to grow on me....\n8.She HATES shopping of any kind.\nActually, she doesn't hate shopping for yarn or fabric so.....\n8A. She HATES shopping ....... unless it's for fabric or yarn.\n9.She's absolutely horrible at video games.\nThis is a big one for my little sister. She's really good at video games.\nMom.... not so much. When she's playing a game, she has a hard time maneuvering both her head and her torso at the same time....\n10. She has an irrational disdain for old fashioned police cars.\nThey make her sick.\n11. \" Can I get a few of those snacker things.... what are they called?\"\nThis was an actual conversation between my mom and the drive through lady at KFC.\n12. She loves Honey Boo Boo.\nThis is actually fairly new.\nFor those of you who aren't in the know, Honey Boo Boo is a seven year old pageant girl.\nShe was in the show \" Toddlers and Tiaras\" . Apparently, people liked her , because now she has her own spin off show.\nPersonally, I'm not that interested in the show. Sure, she's a cute and funny kid.... mom on the other hand, says she wants to adopt Honey Boo Boo.\n13. She has lots of weird dolls.\nLots of them.\nJust the other day, she got a package in the mail . The interchange between her and me went a little something like this :\nMe: \" What's in this?\"\nMom : \" It's my blue vampoodle. Did you happen to see the envelope that has my tiny elf baby?\"\n14. An often used phrase of her's : \" I cut your grapes in half!!\"\nShe says this whenever she feels the need to remind us of the kindness she did us by cutting our grapes in half when we were babies.\n\" I kept you alive!\"\nWell folks, that's my list.\nI had fun, and I hope you did as well.This list could have gone on longer, but I think this will suffice.These are some of my favorite wacky things about my mom. I love my wacky mom.\nSo in the hopes that she doesn't rebuttle by sharing embarrassing stories from my childhood, I shall bid you all adeu.\nUntil next time,\nLauren ( AKA Big sis)", "id": "<urn:uuid:45818e25-563a-40db-83f1-1dcbeeccb5bf>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://anyonecanquilt.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/10/index.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.978670060634613, "token_count": 1235, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

You've got 30 seconds and you're trying to get them refocused and they're all thinking about other things.\"\nAfter the no-call on the block/goaltend, Kris Joseph snared the crucial rebound for Syracuse but lost the ball out of bounds with 6.2 seconds left, prompting a tirade from coach Jim Boeheim and giving West Virginia one last shot.\nUnable to drive the lane as planned, Jabarie Hinds passed to Kevin Jones in the left corner as C.J. Fair stormed at him, and his desperation 3 at the buzzer fell short.\n\"We beat ourselves,\" Gary Browne said. \"We've dug ourselves in a hole where we aren't supposed to be. We feel hurt right now. This loss hurt us a lot.\"\nSyracuse won its second straight after losing at Notre Dame and did so despite being hammered 41-20 on the boards, 24-9 in the second half, and missing 16-of-20 3-point attempts. Still, there was a battle for every loose ball under the baskets and the Mountaineers only finished with a 13-8 edge on second-chance points, not much to show for a 19-5 edge on the offensive glass.\n\"This was one of those games where if you don't make shots, it's going to come down to who makes a play at the end,\" Boeheim said.\nSyracuse (22-1, 9-1 Big East) has won 13 of the past 14 games against West Virginia (15-7, 5-4). The win was the 878th for Boeheim, moving him within one of tying former North Carolina coach Dean Smith for third in Division I history.\nJoseph finished with 13 points and seven rebounds, Scoop Jardine had nine points and five assists and Dion Waiters had eight points for the Orange, who played their third game without Melo.\nThe 7-foot center, who leads the Big East in blocks, watched the game from the bench in street clothes, shouting encouragement at his teammates. After starting the first 20 games of the season and becoming a force in the paint, the big Brazilian has not played since logging 29 minutes in a home win over Pitt nearly two weeks ago. Melo is ineligible because of academic issues but has been practicing with the team, and Boeheim is hopeful he'll be able to return to the lineup.\nJones led West Virginia with 20 points and eight rebounds. Bryant had 12 points, all in the second half, and Browne scored 11.\nThe Mountaineers were coming off a 78-62 loss at St. John's on Wednesday night, a game in which the Red Storm started five freshmen, but they led most of the first half in this one and never trailed by more than three points in the final 17 minutes.\nSyracuse led by four to start the second half and made it 33-27 on Triche's steal and layup with 18:57 to go. After that, it was anybody's game. The score was tied seven times, the last when Jones hit a 3 from the left corner to knot it at 61 with 1:41 left.\n\"They do a great job of playing defense,\" Joseph said. \"We found ways around that at the end. We did what we needed to.\"\nThe Orange were hampered by fouls to their big men. Keita picked up his fourth midway through the half and 6-9 freshman Rakeem Christmas fouled out with 4:58 to go.\nSyracuse trailed most of the first half as the Mountaineers patiently attacked the 2-3 zone. Jones started the game by hitting consecutive mid-range jumpers from the heart of the Syracuse defense.\nThe Mountaineers led by six three times, the last at 22-16 after a 3-pointer by Jones from the left wing with 7:34 left, but they converted only one other basket in the closing minutes — a runner by Hinds — as Syracuse increased the defensive intensity with a press.\nThe Orange forced shot-clock violations on consecutive possessions in the final 3 minutes and Joseph's baseline drive and layup gave Syracuse a 25-24 lead with 68 seconds left, just the Orange's second lead of the half.\nWaiters fed Jardine for a wide-open 3 from the right corner with 3.2 seconds left to give Syracuse a 28-24 halftime lead. It was just the second make in 11 tries from behind the arc for the Orange, who have struggled from long range in conference play, shooting 25 percent in the last six games.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8b8d90d8-44bf-4f76-b3e5-81c1a87309bf>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2012-01-28/syracuse-beats-west-virginia-on-missed-goaltending-call?modid=recommended_2_4", "date": "2013-05-18T06:32:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9804148077964783, "token_count": 1360, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "It happens during coaching changes, one of the aspects of the business.\nThe outgoing coach assembles a recruiting class but the incoming coach has other players in mind. Butch Jones left Cincinnati for Tennessee and when Tommy Tuberville replaced Jones, he wanted to bring recruits with him, especially at quarterback.\nThat left Massillon (Ohio) native Kyle Kempt high and dry. Most quarterbacks are done with recruiting well before National Signing Day and Kempt was no exception — he picked the Bearcats nearly a year ago. This late in the recruiting cycle, there are few scholarships left for quarterbacks at BCS schools. So if the school you're committed to has a coaching change, it can leave a recruit like Kempt with few options.\nThis weekend, Kempt might have found an even better home than Cincinnati. Oregon State was nationally ranked in the 2012 season and in the Pac-12, a better conference than the Big East. Kempt got his last-second offer and committed on the spot.\nWanna thank God through all this, I'm keeping the orange and black and committing to Oregon State! Go Beavs!— Kyle Kempt (@KyleKempt) Jan. 27, 2013\nBefore picking Cincinnati, Kempt had offers from Indiana, Ole Miss, Tennessee, West Virginia, Toledo and Bowling Green — but many of those options dried up months ago after he picked the Bearcats.\nKempt broke down his strengths to Sporting News in an interview given last year.\n\"There are a couple common things colleges are impressed with when they break down my film,\" Kempt told Sporting News. \"They like that I have a strong arm, make good decisions with the football, I'm accurate with my throws and I have a good pocket presence … Being a student of the game, studying film constantly, that's a strength.

{"text": "DENVER— The Denver Broncos have parted ways with versatile but vexing linebacker D.J. Williams.\nThe Broncos released the nine-year veteran Monday on the eve of free agency, freeing up his $6 million salary in 2013 for other needs.\n\"We appreciate the contributions made by D.J. Williams during his time with the Broncos,\" John Elway, vice president of football operations, said in a statement. \"He was a solid player with this team for a number of years, showing a lot of versatility at linebacker. Our organization wishes D.J. all the best going forward.\"\nThe Broncos also have asked Pro Bowl defensive end Elvis Dumervil to take a pay cut. If not, he'll be traded or released before Saturday when his $12 million salary for 2013 becomes guaranteed. Dumervil is also due $10 million in 2014 and $8 million in 2015.\nWilliams missed nine games while serving a pair of NFL-mandated suspensions last season and was deemed expendable after Wesley Woodyard had a breakout season at weakside linebacker in Jack Del Rio's defense.\nThe Broncos also released third quarterback Caleb Hanie, a former Colorado State star who didn't take a single snap in his one season in Denver following four years as the backup in Chicago.\nThe Broncos were busy on many fronts Monday, finalizing a three-year deal to keep backup safety David Bruton, their top special teams player, and working to keep defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson in navy and orange before the start of free agency Tuesday.\nWilliams' departure is notable because he and cornerback Champ Bailey were the longest-tenured Broncos, their careers in Denver dating back to Mike Shanahan's time as coach.\nWilliams was a first-round draft pick (17th overall) out of the University of Miami in 2004 and played four different linebacker positions during his nine seasons in Denver, where he led the team in tackles five times.\n\"It's the nature of the business,\" Bruton said about Williams' release. \"Guys change, things change. D.J. is still a young player. He was a great teammate. He'll definitely make it somewhere and he'll continue to make plays because whenever he stepped on the field here, he made plays. Best of luck to him. He's been a great player and a good teammate. Just, his time was up here.\"\nWilliams is one of only five NFL players during the last nine seasons to post at least 800 tackles and 20 sacks, and he displayed his versatility by starting at the weakside, middle, strongside and inside positions for a revolving door of defensive coordinators and schemes in Denver.\nHe turns 31 this summer and is sure to draw interest on the open market but he is coming off a season in which he collected just 14 tackles in seven games and only made one start because of his two suspensions that cost him about $4 million in salary and relegated him to playing on special teams and in sub packages upon his return in November.\nWilliams was suspended six games for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs and three games for an alcohol-related arrest in 2010 that led to a conviction last August.\nHe was originally charged with driving under the influence, but a jury convicted him of the lesser charge of driving while impaired. He was also convicted of driving without headlights, the offense that prompted police to stop him near downtown Denver in the early morning hours on Nov. 12, 2010, before taking him to a detox facility.\nThe Broncos stripped Williams of his captaincy shortly after his arrest — the second time he'd been detained for suspicion of drunken driving. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to impaired driving.\nA judge last fall sentenced him to 30 days of house arrest and two years' probation.\nWilliams also made news last summer by tweeting a picture of his new digital playbook and saying his coaches were asking him to switch positions yet again.\nIf Dumervil follows Williams out the door, the Broncos will have some big shoes to fill on a defense that was one of the NFL's stingiest last season.\n\"It's always important to keep a defense together,\" Bruton said. \"This is the first time having the same defensive coordinator in my career here. So I feel like that's a great step in the right direction. But teams change, players change. We just don't want to change that mentality no matter who we bring in.\n\"As far as me worrying, I don't have to worry as much anymore. You still worry who they bring in, because the NFL is a revolving door. Guys come in, guys come out. It's just the nature of the business.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:77943aaf-7acc-4b62-8f7f-78d8d3169bc5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2013-03-11/dj-williams-released-by-denver-broncos", "date": "2013-05-18T06:30:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9858317971229553, "token_count": 953, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Monday, January 25, 2010, 05:30 pm\nNotes of interest from Apple's Q1 2010 conference callThe first quarter of Apple's 2010 fiscal year was another record breaking three-month frame for the company, which sold more Macs and iPhones than ever before. Monday, the company conducted a financial conference call with analysts and the press, and notes of interest follow.\nOn Monday, Apple revealed the results of its fiscal 2010 first quarter, which ended Dec. 26, 2009. The company posted revenue of $15.68 billion and a net quarterly profit of $3.38 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. That's an increase from revenue of $11.88 billion and net quarterly profit of $2.26 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago frame.\nApple's blowout quarter surpassed its previous quarterly record by almost $3.5 billion.\nParticipating on Monday's call were Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer and Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook.\nApple's regional business segments\nThe real standout in Apple's worldwide business breakdown was the fact that international sales accounted for 58 percent of the company's revenue. The largest overseas slice came from Europe, which accounted for $5.024 billion in revenue, partially from sales of 1.068 million Macs.\nMac sales in Italy, France, Switzerland and Spain all grew more than 40 percent. Australia up over 70 percent, China up almost 100 percent.\nApple Americas garnered $6.092 billion in total from the U.S., including sales of 1.187 million Macs. In all, 3.362 million Macs were sold in the quarter.\nAsia Pacific accounted for $1.183 billion, including sales of 313,000 Macs. And Japan was $783 million, selling 105,000 computers.\nApple's \"Other Music Related Products and Services\" segment was responsible for $1.164 billion in revenue. Apple's \"Peripherals and Other Hardware\" added $469 million in revenue.\nThe company's \"iPhone and related products and services\" accounted for $5.578 billion in revenue, based on sales of 8.737 million units. Apple's \"Software, Service and Other Sales\" segment produced $631 million.\n$39.8B in cash at the end of the Dec. quarter, an increase of 5 billion from the previous quarter.\nApple's Mac business\nMac sales were broken down into 2.128 million portables, and 1.234 million desktops. Desktop sales were up 70 percent year-over-year, and saw a 60 percent increase in revenue. They also spiked 57 percent in sales from the previous quarter. Customers are thrilled with the new iMacs, officials said.\nPortable sales were also up 18 percent in sales year over year, and 9 percent in revenue. However, the notebook market was down 6 percent in units and 5 percent in revenue from the previous quarter. Mac and MacBook sales were up 16 percent year over year in education. New December records for K-12 and high-ed channels.\nCook said that represented the best growth rate for education since before the recession began.\n\"Our whole education business is based on we really understand teaching and learning and student achievement at a deep level, we think we're the only company that really gets it, we do more than sell boxes like other companies do,\" he said. \"I think we can continue to do well and was thrilled to see the results from last quarter.\"\nPrevious Mac record was set in September quarter, Apple beat it this quarter by almost 300K. Grew more than 30 percent year over year.\n\"We are extremely proud of this result and believe our Mac hardware and software are providing outstanding software and innovation that our customers really love,\" Oppenheimer said.\nApple's iPhone and Apple TV businesses\nRecord 8.7 million iPhones sold Revenue for iPhone handset sales, accessories, and carrier payments was $5.58 billion.\nAverage Selling Price of about $620 for the iPhone during the quarter.

However, Cook declined to comment on whether the \"halo\" effect applied to iPod use in the consumer markets could lead to Mac adoption in the corporate world.\nMore than 200,000 iPhones have been sold in China with carrier China Unicom. Cook said Apple is concentrating now on the customer experience and point of sales.\n\"We would prefer to move slow because we're building the brand for the long term and we're very much focused on the long-term of the market, because we think there is significant potential there,\" Cook said. He declined to forecast where sales could go.\nCook also defended the company's approval process for the App Store, noting that more than 90 percent of software submitted is approved within 14 days of submission. He said some rejections are to prevent inappropriate content, like pornography.\n\"Most of the rejections, however, are actually bugs in the code itself,\" Cook said. \"This is protecting the customer and the developer to a great extent, because they don't want customers who are unhappy with the app.\"\nApple's iPod business\nSold almost 21 million iPods. iPod average selling price increased 9 percent, revenue increased 1 percent. Share remains at almost 70 percent. iPod is the top-selling MP3 player, and gains share internationally.

As noted by Bloomberg, the nature of the complaint was not revealed in the notice, and the document is not yet available to view.\nThe new complaint, numbered 2828, is categorized with \"Portable Electronic Devices and Related Software.\" Named as proposed respondents are HTC Corp., of China., HTC America Inc. of Bellevue, Wash.\nAsking the ITC to ban the import of devices is standard practice when a lawsuit is filed. Similar motions were made in legal spats Apple has had with Nokia and Samsung.\nApple first sued HTC in the ITC in March of 2010, and accused the Taiwanese company of infringing on 20 patents related to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. In a statement, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said though competition is \"healthy,\" competitors should not \"steal\" Apple's technology.\nThough the suit was directed at HTC, the complaint specifically targeted a number of phones that run Google's Android mobile operating system, leading many to believe the real purpose of the complaint was to serve as a warning shot toward Google. For its part, HTC fired back with its own lawsuit, accusing Apple of infringing on five patents.\nThe first complaint filed by Apple against HTC is set to be decided on by a judge on Aug. 5. The findings will the be subject to review by the full commission.\nHTC saw an early victory in the case in April, when the ITC staff voiced it support for the company as the trial began. The staff made the non-binding recommendation in favor of HTC, but the actual ruling will be made by ITC Administrative Law Judge Carl Charneski next month, and will then be reviewed by the six-member commission.\nOn Topic: patents\n- Apple's iPhone e-wallet concept suggests payment options based on context\n- Apple's 'social camera flash' connects multiple iPhones, iPads to light a scene\n- Apple patent lets users control a device with taps, thumps and scratches\n- Apple wins utility patent for MacBook's trackpad design\n- Judge orders Google to hand over search documents in Samsung patent case", "id": "<urn:uuid:5ba41725-74c0-4832-b611-e16863cc8c4c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/07/11/apple_asks_itc_to_block_import_of_htc_handsets_in_latest_patent_complaint.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:02:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9594846963882446, "token_count": 515, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

View the audio archives.\n- Created 15 October 2010; Published 1 November 2010Convocation: R. Dale Guthrie\nProfessor emeritus at the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, R. Dale Guthrie is a renowned paleobiologist and artist. His many books and papers have covered a wide range of interests, including evolutionary dwarfing, social anatomy, causes of extinctions, climatic change and human evolution. In the past few decades his lifelong hunting experience and hobbies of painting and sculpting have dovetailed with his scientific interests, leading to his landmark study, The Natural History of Paleolithic Art.\nPrior to Guthrie's book there was no widespread practice of using information and ideas from natural history and studies of human universals in approaching the thousands of art images made by members of Eurasian Ice Age bands. The cave paintings and other preserved remnants of Paleolithic peoples shed light on a world little known to us. With a natural historian's keen eye for observation, and as one who has spent a lifetime using bones and other excavated materials to piece together past human behavior and environments, Guthrie demonstrates that Paleolithic art is a mode of expression we can comprehend to a remarkable degree and that the perspective of natural history is integral to that comprehension. He employs a mix of ethology, evolutionary biology, and human universals, along with innovative forensic techniques, to access these distant cultures and their art and artifacts.\nThe title of Dr. Guthrie's presentation was \"Evolution of Art, Morality, and Romantic Love in the Ice Age Human Band.\"\n- Created 1 October 2010; Published 6 October 2010Convocation: Rudolph Byrd\nThe Goodrich C.

She grew up a self-hating young woman, entering one abusive relationship after another. She became a heroin user, went to prison for possession of the drug and was raped and beaten before she began her long contemplative journey to change. She later began her journalism career at the Miami News, and worked for sixteen years as a reporter with the Washington Post, where she carved a niche for herself focusing on human-interest stories that reflected current issues. During this time she spent six years researching a notorious Washington, D.C. murder for which eight young men remain incarcerated. Her work on the story raised serious doubts about the guilt of the youths and showed readers the absolute power wielded by police and prosecutors. This story plus her own experience with the judicial and penal systems sparked her to begin speaking on the states of those systems today, including the high rate of incarceration among minorities and the poor, questionable police practices, prosecutors with too much power, and the weeding out of bad lawyers.

{"text": "Late Night Trivia\nWhat is LNT?\nLate Night Trivia is a four-hour student-organized trivia and activity-based competition broadcast on KRLX 88.1 FM on the first day of Reading Days each winter term. The format is the same from year to year but changes minute to minute.\nLNT will be held on Tuesday, March 12th, 2013 from 7:00PM to 11:00PM this year!\nHere's what happens:\n- A trivia question is asked over the radio, and then a song is played.\n- Teams have until the end of that song to answer the question asked before the song and identify the song and artist.\n- Fourish \"Action Trivias\" are announced throughout the night; they involve sending a contingent from (or all of) your team to a specified location and performing a specified task, usually involve acting something out, building something, or consuming something.\n- Fourish \"Medleys\" (a series of sounds spliced together) are also played throughout the competition; your job is to identify the correct elements from these compilations, elements that can range from who's talking, who's singing, or what's happening.\n- The Stumper is the crème de la crème of LNT; a series of clues (usually with a relatively simple answer) which gradually decreases in difficultly. The Stumper is worth major points but its worth scales down with each team that gets it right. Translation: the first team to get The Stumper gets the most points, the 2nd team to get it gets the 2nd most points, 3rd team 3rd most points, and so on.\n- The headquarters of LNT this year is Sayles 251.\nHow do you win?\n- The first team to correctly answer each question gets a prize as does the first team to identify the song and artist.\n- Each question, song, \"Action Trivia,\" \"Medley,\" The Stumper, and bribe is worth points and at the end of the night top teams win mediocre / absurdly thrilling prizes.\n- The most spirited team according to The Gods wins the privilege to sign their team name on the LNT Spirit Trophy.\n- Bribes will be requested by The Gods over the air throughout the competition in Sayles 251; the teams who can deliver the desired item(s) to them will receive bonus points.\n- To see the official scoring rules go here.\nHave some important phone numbers:\n- To register and find out your very important team number in the hour before LNT starts, call x5622\n- During LNT, to answer a question or identify a song or artist, call x4127\n- During LNT, to answer The Stumper or a \"Medley,\" call x5622\nA note about competitive spirit:\n- While the Gods have no way to control how you choose to identify and discover the songs that we play, in the spirit of LNT, we encourage you to partake in the thrill of the hunt and work actively with your own knowledge and with the tools that can aid that knowledge instead of letting some device or program steal the fun from you.\n- Teams can be any size.\n- Teams can be any combination of students. Floor teams tend to do well but so do clubs that play together or just a group of friends.\n- You must register your team during the hour (6 P.M - 7 P.M) before LNT begins by calling the phone number above and giving your team name and a contact phone number in order to get your official team number. This official team number must be used to identify your team when calling in answers, performing \"Action Trivias,\" giving The Gods gifts, or answering The Stumper so make sure your whole team knows this official team number.\nEmail holewind for more information.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f10d69d3-9dee-4d79-80d0-bcdb8969b238>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://apps.carleton.edu/student/orgs/latenighttrivia/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:02:07Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9434384107589722, "token_count": 800, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "July 13, 2012\nThe Lord is coming soon.\nUnmarked helicopters, hovering.\nThey said it was a weather balloon.\nNote: Today’s episode of Archie Kobain was filmed on a closed track using professional drivers. Do not attempt this on your own.\nAnd speaking of strippers…\nMy gig is up. That’s right – my true identity has been revealed. I must admit, I am a little ashamed of not having come clean earlier. After all, so many have said to me, “you look so familiar – where do I know you from?” But… No. I maintained my silence. Well, now it’s all out there in the open.\nUndoubtedly, you’ve all recognized me from my younger days when I worked in the adult entertainment industry. On screen, of course. That’s right. It’s me. It turns out that I am not locked away in a Ukrainian prison and, despite the rumors, I was not killed in a bizarre New York fetish club accident involving three chickens, Scott Stapp (the guy from Creed), and Krysten Ritter.\nTruth is, I started that rumor.\nBesides, there were only two chickens. But I digress…\nThe bottom line is that, my identity has been revealed and that’s OK. Instead of hiding, I have decided to embrace who I really am. Therefore, from this moment on, I will only answer to my official porn-star name, Loco Helicopter.\nI know. That’s the first thing that people ask…\n“Loco, just what did you have to do to earn that name?”\nAll I am aloud to say is – rent one of my films.\nJesus, Barry & Joe…\nOK, so I came across the strangest thing the other day. Someone had taken a piece of poster-board, some magic markers and made themselves a sign that said, “Jesus + Obama + Biden = Jobs”. Then they took this sign and affixed it to the trunk lid of their car using duct tape.\nI know. I can’t believe I didn’t get a photo, either…\nSo, what is one to do with this great information. My first thought was make up my own sign and park next to them. My sign was going to contain some similarly arbitrary information like, “Krishna + Mandela + Gore = Gates”.\nName of a (somewhat) prominent religious figure + the names of two random politicians = the last name of a prominent technology figurehead. Of course, they went with Jobs, who is dead and I went with Gates, who is believed to still be alive.\nNext, since Jesus didn’t really have a last name and we just knew him as - Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph, of the family of David – don’t you think they should have gone with all first names? Like “Jesus + Barack + Joe = Steve” …or in the case that they were actually talking about jobs, as in creating jobs or otherwise performing work, ”Jesus + Barack + Joe = Jobs”.\n…but that leads to an entirely different set of issues. First of all, I think we can all agree that, if Jesus were here today, he’d be a republican. Don’t you think? How awkward would it be if he wasn’t?\nIn any case, I don’t think Jesus is looking for a job. He has a job. He’s been doing that same gig for a few thousand years. He’s locked into that job worse than The Pope. Obama and Biden on the other hand, I think they’re headed for the unemployment line (personally) but maybe that’s just me.\nIsn’t someone supposed to throw a net over me if I seem to be headed off on a tangent with no point? Barnsley?\nMusical Guest? Sure. We have time.\nSo you think you can dance…\nYou know how every once in a while, I put you onto a song or an artist and then you just can’t get enough of them? C’mon! You know it happens. Remember Yacht? …or Robyn? Well, get ready for Butterfly.\nButterfly Boucher that is – and that is her real name. Yes, really. And I’m totally addicted to her stuff. All her stuff… her music, her look. Oh, yeah baby. I likes me some Butterfly and I think you will too. Please enjoy…\nFrom her recently released, self-titled album…here’s Butterfly Boucher and 5678!\nUh, huh? What’d you think? I know. She’s awesome.\nSo, get this. She co-produced Missy Higgins’ new album. True dat.\nAnd if you’re like me. You want some more, don’t cha? Well, go buy her stuff.\nIn the meantime, here’s a little fun with Butterfly & Missy…\nI know, right? I want strawberries and champagne. How is that gay?\nWhat was your favorite part?\nI can’t decide but I think it was Missy’s dancing.\nGet your mind out of the gutter. B-man. Barnsley’s favorite part was, “two hot chicks on a bed with instruments, making noise”. Of course, he said it with his British accent, which somehow makes it seem less inappropriate.\nAnd speaking of redheads…\nOne of my readers came up with a brilliant idea. He said, “Hey Arch (He didn’t know to call me Loco, at the time), Why don’t you have a Redhead of the Week”. I know. The guy is a genius. At first I thought it was a little too Mariachi Static but then I thought, isn’t everything?\nWe’ll be starting that next week. I was going to start it this week but today we’re going to feature Super Girl and I didn’t want her taking away any of the glam & glory from our very first Redhead of the Week. So, for now, enjoy this photo of what will mostly likely be our one and only ever, Super Girl of the Week…\nSupergirl – everyone should have one.\n…then, be sure to tune in next week for the launch of our exciting new segment.\nAnyway, it’s time to wrap this thing up. We’re ending a another broadcast day. You’ve been a lovely crowd. You don’t have to go home but… well… on second thought, YES. Yes you do… Go home!\nJune 29, 2012\nWelcome back my friends.\nThis installement of Archie Kobain is brought to you by…\nAnd by that I mean that I had to have several shots of this fine Vulcan nectar, in order to write this week’s installment. By the way, if you haven’t had Don Julio 70, their Limited Edition 70th Anniversary tequila, you REALLY should. It’s magically delicious. It kicks Lucky Charms’ ass on being magically delicious.\nNot that there’s anything wrong with that…\nOK, so… At the risk of being ostracized by the G&L community, as a journalist, I feel that I have the responsibility to report the facts (or fiction) as I see them. Agreed?\nSo, not too long ago, I’m talking to a friend of mine who got himself into one of those awkward situations that most of us only dream of being in…or not. Somehow, he manages to be find himself at Disney’s EPCOT center, sometime near the end of May or early June during what they call, “Gay Days”. It is important to note that, my friend is not gay.\nNevertheless, there he is and completely unaware of the situation. Also, he is wearing a red shirt, which (apparently) is one of the outward symbols of comradery or general, uh, gayness….supposedly.\nWell, next thing you know, he’s at one of the drinking establishments, uh – drinking – most likely at the Rose & Crown in the United Kingdom – and he strikes up a conversation with a couple of good looking ladies. Of course, they were there together. Yes, together like that.\nNevertheless, one of them is trying to pick up my friend. She tells him that she is gay, the other girl is her girl friend, but – get this – she has been thinking of “experimenting”. OK, that’s fine. But she’s hitting on my friend, thinking that he’s gay. That doesn’t even make any sense. If you wanted to experiment, you need a straight guy. Otherwise, you are trying to convert a gay guy, to experiment with – that’s not a very good experiment. That’s like trying to convert ham back into pork because you don’t feel like driving to your local BBQ joint… What???\nAbout this time, my friend has figured out what’s going on. Now he’s trying to convince everyone that he’s not gay…but they aren’t buying this. After all, he’s there, wearing the red shirt, and talking to the lesbians. All the while he’s thinking – and I have to quote him…\n“Trying to pickup lesbians, how is that gay?”\nThere are so many things wrong with that statement.\nBut at the end of the day, my friend believes that he has discovered a secret society, a subculture of closet heterosexuals within the gay and lesbian community. Think about it.\nOK now stop thinking about it.\nI’m going to stop before readers turn haters, turn lynch mob on me.\nBut speaking of people with unclear sexual preferences, if you’ve been with me for a while, you know I love Missy Higgins but I bet you didn’t know this… She had taken a few years off from making music. The articles I’ve read seem to indicate that she was suffering from depression and had even given up on music all together, in spite of her international success. Well, she’s back, and…\nOur little girl is all grown up…\nMissy has a new album locked, loaded and ready to go, “The Ol’ Razzle Dazzle”. It releases in the US on July 17th, with an album launch party at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. See you there, Missy. Although, maybe I’ll catch you in Nashville or at Red Rocks.\nHey that’s pretty cool.\nI called someone Missy, and that was actually her name.\nOK, so… Be prepared to be blown away.\nI promised not to talk about this song anymore, so I won’t say it, but…\nGuess who Missy is touring with? Guess? And guess who she fills in for sometimes?\nDid you guess?\nYeah… I’m definitely going to Red Rocks.\nAnd yeah, that was Missy. Is she looking hot or what?\nAnd just so we all agree, this Gotye guy, he’s getting laid a lot, right?\nBut enough about him and that damned song that I’m not supposed to be talking about. Let’s talk more about Missy. After all, this week’s musical guest is Melissa Morrison Higgins.

{"text": "One of the problems with life is dealing with change. Nothing is static. Everything is constantly changing. While that has always been true, the pace of change has accelerated in modern times. The volume of changes that seem to have some impact on us has gone up, and the awareness of change has intensified. We are constantly told that newer and better stuff is now available, to replace the stuff we just bought yesterday, which we may not have had a chance to use yet. We live in an era where we now measure things in internet time. Stability and constancy are old-fashioned virtues. This is a hallmark of technology and is particularly true when dealing with computers and software. Open source software is no exception; in fact, quite the opposite is true. Drupal and WordPress have different schemes for how they drive change into their user communities and offer different facilities to their users to comprehend and administration change. These differences are not inconsequential.\nIn this post I’m going to discuss a new viewpoint on requirements that I haven’t mentioned before: architecturally significant requirements (ASRs); and I’m going to cover a few hot button elements on my evaluation of Drupal and WordPress for architectedfutures.net.\nWhat Are Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs)?\nArchitecturally significant requirements are those requirements that play an important role in determining the architecture of the system. Such requirements require special attention. Not all requirements have equal significance with regards to the architecture.\nASRs are either functional or non-functional requirements (see part 1). What makes them significant is the impact they have on the architectural solution. If the ASRs aren’t satisfied the customer, the user, isn’t just inconvenienced, the solution doesn’t work; it doesn’t do the job. The architecture is wrong for the problem. It doesn’t provide a solid and stable solution, or it fails to please the user in how it achieves its function. Deciding what is architecturally significant is a matter of skill and judgment. Determining how well a particular solution fills requirements, especially before the fact (a priori), is again a matter of skill and judgment.\nASRs are typically defined in terms of key requirements that are the motivating factors in the design of the architecture for the system. Some of these requirements are functional. A lot of these requirements are qualitative. But what does that mean? In the architecture of buildings there is a significant difference between a church, an office building and an airplane manufacturing facility. That’s functional. But the difference between a church, a chapel and a cathedral isn’t so much functional (putting aside the aspect of scale), it’s qualitative. Or compare the differences between a half-dozen major office buildings, or compare a half-dozen architect designed 3 bedroom, 3 bath, two car garage houses. The differences in the architecture of the office buildings, or the houses, isn’t functional so much as qualitative. The same is true of other systems, including software systems and social systems. “What is it?” tends to be about function. The way it gets done, the style, the attitude, tends to be qualitative. And quality matters. Quality can drive durability. Quality can drive satisfaction.\nArchitected Futures Community of Practice ASRs\nFor my evaluation of Drupal versus WordPress (versus whatever) as the technology platform for the Architected Futures Community of Practice (AFCoP), the object being architected is AFCoP, not WordPress or Drupal. I am not writing the specifications for, nor am I designing, Drupal or WordPress. So, I am not trying to define, nor am I overly concerned with WordPress or Drupal ASRs. I am concerned and focused with AFCoP ASRs.\nWhat I’m saying is that things exist in layered, compositional hierarchies. At some point we draw a line around something and that becomes the object of focus. The architected object. The environment it exists in is outside of the object. It may have interactions with other things in that environment, but they are external to the object of concern. You don’t really design your environment. You come to grips with it; you learn to deal with it. As you look at what is inside you decompose the object into parts. If the parts are novel, you may need to design (architect) them. As you do that, you decompose those parts into other parts. If the parts aren’t novel, you can either design new parts, if you feel the need, or you can obtain pre-fabricated parts from a catalog; or you can do a little of each by making adjustments to catalog parts. This is the internal mechanics of the object. However, at some point, you become unconcerned with the details of how the remaining parts work. It stops being a primary issue with respect to operation of the object you are concerned with. The parts just need to do a job. Catalog parts are fine. You don’t want to design how they do that job, as long as the job gets done. If one part doesn’t work to your satisfaction, you swap it out and get another part.\nThere are two layers of architected entities that I am primarily concerned about in the creation of my community of practice.\n- The first, outer layer, is AFCoP – the community of interacting people. This is essentially the architecture of a social system, a Community of Practice. That community will exist in an environment of planet Earth, human beings, the internet, etc. The components involve topics, interaction policies, the involved people, groups and sub-groups, technology for communicating, etc.\n- The inner layer of concern to me is the architecture of the technology platform to support the Community of Practice. The technology platform architecture is a part of the Community of Practice architecture. The platform will be architectedfutures.net. The environment for architectedfutures.net will be the AFCoP community, a hosting service, the internet, external support services, etc. The components of architectedfutures.net will include a lower level (nested) technology platform (WordPress or Drupal), a particular set of add-on modules, etc.\nThe AFCoP technology platform, architectedfutures.net, is an ASR for AFCoP. How well the community is able to interact is critically dependent on the facilities provided by the technology platform. To meet that ASR architectedfutures.net is being designed specifically to meet the needs of AFCoP. This won’t be a social network site for a church group or a book club. It has special requirements to support the mission and focal interest of the Architected Futures™ community. If certain features, some functional, some qualitative, aren’t there, then the success of the community will be jeopardized. In a similar way, the choice of base platform (Drupal, WordPress, some other package, custom code, etc.) is an ASR for architectedfutures.net. The structure, the support requirements and the way the functional capabilities are provided by the infrastructure is a critical factor in the success of architectedfutures.net. But it isn’t all or nothing. The Drupal and WordPress platforms are being evaluated as candidate components to provide the base for architectedfutures.net‘s architecture. Some tasks can be done with either platform, although they may vary somewhat in how they are done. Other tasks or functions aren’t so benign. Their presence or absence may be critical to the community, or the way they are achieved may have a major effect on the community. That impact makes those qualities of the infrastructure architecturally significant to the community of practice. Those are the key qualities I want to focus on in terms of my decision.", "id": "<urn:uuid:884fe6d2-38fb-4304-a44f-da6b118dfed3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://architectedfutures.info/2011/09/21/part-3-asrs-and-riding-the-wave-of-change/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9396666884422302, "token_count": 1635, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "1. Why is extremism an issue in prisons?\nExtremist groups often pose special security risks in prisons. They may encourage the overthrow of the government, and prison officials can be targeted as agents of \"illegal\" government authority. Further, their literature often encourages ethnic hatred, promoting a violent and racially charged prison atmosphere.\nSince the 1980s, white supremacist organizations have spread throughout the American prison system, beginning with the growth of Aryan Brotherhood.1 Aryan Nations, although not permitting inmates to become members, has engaged in \"prison outreach\" since 1979. In 1987, it began publishing a \"prison outreach newsletter\" called The Way to facilitate recruitment. Aryan Nations also disseminates its literature and letters to inmates. The World Church of the Creator and some Identity Church groups engage in similar outreach activity, as do other racist groups, such as Nation of Islam. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nonideological criminal prison gangs are often organized based on race, which increases racial polarization.\nImprisoned extremists also pose a security threat by continuing their activities while incarcerated. They recruit inmates, and teach other inmates extremist tactics. Some imprisoned extremists also have attempted to continue to influence adherents outside of prison by, for instance, publishing newsletters from the prison to maintain their outside following.\nPrison officials have responded in various ways, reflecting the fact that each state has its own prison system (as do cities, counties and the federal government), and that prisons have varying populations. At times, prison officials have tried to limit access to extremist literature, and these responses have occasionally given rise to litigation because they potentially impinge upon inmates' First Amendment rights. The questions are especially complicated when the censored material comes from a group that claims to be religious.\n1 Aryan Brotherhood, at one time associated with Aryan Nations, began as a virulent racist and anti-Semitic prison gang, and has since developed into a crime gang associated with extortion, drug operations and prison violence.\n2. Do inmates have the same First Amendment rights as everybody else?\nThe United States Supreme Court has said that \"prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.\" Nevertheless, inmates' First Amendment rights are less extensive than other citizens' and their rights can be limited due to security or other penological concerns. Because of the particular challenges administrators face running prisons, the Supreme Court has acknowledged there is a compelling government interest which warrants limiting prisoners' rights. Courts have been deferential to prison officials' assessments of security threats, and sensitive to their related regulatory decisions, even if such decisions impact inmates' First Amendment rights.\nA prison regulation that impinges on an inmate's constitutional rights will be upheld in court if that regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. This means that, generally, prison officials can ban extremist materials from prisons because of concerns that the distribution of such material will undermine prison security. Extremist books, leaflets, and magazines have been forbidden to prisoners on this basis. Such material has not been allowed through the mail and has not been kept in the prison library.\nHowever, prisons have less discretion to limit inmates' religious practices than other First Amendment rights due to a new federal law. Because of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), prison officials' discretion in limiting access to extremist material may depend in part on whether such material is related to an inmate's religious exercise. Therefore, prison regulations that affect religious exercise, including access to religious literature, will be reviewed carefully if challenged in court.\n3. What legal standard is used to determine the constitutionality of prison regulations?\nThe Supreme Court announced the standard under which it would review the constitutionality of prison regulations in Turner v. Safley, a case involving a challenge to a complete prohibition on inmate marriage. As noted earlier, a prison regulation is constitutional if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. Under this standard, courts have upheld regulations based on the consideration of certain factors:\n- Is there a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\ninterest put forward to justify it?\n- Are there alternative means of exercising the assert- ed right that remain open to inmates?\n- How great a negative impact will accommodating the inmates' rights have on guards, other inmates,a\nnd on the allocation of prison resources?\nCourts will consider the existence of obvious and easy alternatives to a challenged regulation as evidence of a regulation's arbitrariness.\n4. Is the same legal standard used to determine the constitutionality of prison regulations that implicate an inmate's right to free exercise of religion?\nNo, the same standard is not applicable to determining the constitutionality of prison regulations alleged to violate inmates' free exercise rights. The constitutionality of such regulations is determined under the more stringent standard set forth in RLUIPA. RLUIPA says that the government cannot impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of an inmate, even if the inmate's religious exercise is being limited by a generally applicable rule. However, an inmate's religious practices can be limited if the prison official demonstrates that the regulations in question (i) further a compelling interest and (ii) the same interest cannot be served in a manner that is less restrictive of the inmate's free exercise rights.\nSince RLUIPA was enacted in September 2000, it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. Therefore, how this statute will impact prison regulations that affect inmates' religious exercise remains unclear.\n5. How should prison officials evaluate whether particular material can be withheld from inmates?\nGenerally, the First Amendment does not allow speech to be censored by the government because of the content of that speech. The government can only limit the time, place, and manner of speech. However, because inmates have more limited First Amendment rights than other citizens, some content-based discrimination is allowed for security reasons. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld a prison official's decision to withhold entire issues of the magazine, Muhammad Speaks, because certain articles in the magazine created a danger of violence by advocating racial, religious, or national hatred. This decision was prior to the passage of RLUIPA, and therefore the Court's analysis might be somewhat different today. Under current law, if having the entire magazine withheld was determined to be a substantial burden on inmates' free exercise rights, the Court might require that the offending material be removed rather than the entire issue being withheld.\nRegulations that exclude publications from a prison because of security concerns have been found constitutional when the regulations have required individualized review of any material before it is banned, notification to inmates that the material has been denied, and the possibility of review of such decisions. Courts have tended to find prison regulations that ban all literature from particular groups unconstitutional. However, the determination of the constitutionality of a given regulation or the implementation of the regulation has tended to be very fact-specific. Courts look not only at the regulation at issue but also consider the nature of the prison (high, medium, or low security) and the particular administrative challenges faced by the prison (such as crowding and quantity of incoming mail) in determining reasonableness, or the practical existence of less restrictive alternative measures.\n6. Can prison officials apply the same restrictions to outgoing prison material?\nThe Supreme Court does not allow content regulation with respect to outgoing mail from inmates. While outgoing mail can be searched for contraband,2 content regulation of outgoing mail is also more restricted because it implicates the First Amendment rights of non-prisoner addressees.3 In addition, outgoing material does not pose a threat to internal prison security; therefore content limitations have been considered less urgent. However, regulations can limit the content of outgoing mail categorically. For example, escape plans, threats, running a business, and blackmail are categories that have been disallowed. Therefore, correspondence from prisoners to extremist groups cannot be banned outright because of its content. However, inmates can be prevented from distributing a newsletter from prison when doing so constitutes running a business.\n2 Special rules exist with respect to attorney-client correspondence or mail that implicates an inmate's right to access the courts that are beyond the scope of this discussion.\n3 However, prison officials can forbid all correspondence between incarcerated individuals.\n7. Can extremist \"missionaries\" be prevented from visiting prisons?\nPrison officials can ban categories of prison visitors, such as former inmates or visitors who have previously broken visiting rules. An extremist \"missionary\" can be barred from a prison because of generally applicable rules. In addition, prisons can create procedures for requesting visiting ministers, and impose conditions on the selection of the ministers, such as sponsorship by an outside religious organization. Prison officials can also exclude prison \"missionaries\" if they are advocating violence or otherwise fomenting prison unrest by encouraging racial tension. However, under RLUIPA, the prison would have to show that any restrictions on visiting clergy are the least restrictive means of achieving its end.\nPrison officials do not have a responsibility to hire a minister for each religious denomination represented in the prison population. However, if visiting ministers of one denomination are compensated, visiting ministers of other denominations must be equally compensated. Security limitations can be placed on inmate-led prayer or services, but again, under RLUIPA, the prison would have to show that any restrictions on such gatherings is the least restrictive means of achieving its end. For example, it is more likely that the prison could limit the frequency of such meetings, the number of attendees and require supervision than that such gatherings could be banned outright.\n8. Under what circumstances must prisons accommodate prisoners' religious dietary requirements?\nAccommodating religiously based dietary rules has become an issue when dealing with extremists because incidents have raised concern that extremists \"adopt\" religious practices that are not based on sincere beliefs in order to obtain special privileges, such as specialized diets. Generally, if an inmate's request for a special diet is because of a sincerely held belief and religious in nature, the inmate has a constitutionally protected interest. Under RLUIPA, a request for a special religious diet can only be refused based on a compelling prison interest and if it is the least restrictive means possible for the prison protecting that interest. Prisons may offer more limited food selection to prisoners with religious dietary limitations, such as providing only cold kosher meals rather than hot food. In the past, when determining whether a prison was required to provided a special diet for a prisoner, courts have considered whether the dietary restrictions were central to the prisoner's religious observance. Under RLUIPA, such a determination would probably not be relevant. The threshold question in evaluating the prison's obligation to accommodate a request would still be whether the inmate's dietary request arose out of sincerely held beliefs that were religious in nature.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4b29297a-7223-4dae-a9fc-a294677b62b3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://archive.adl.org/civil_rights/prison_ex.asp", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9501674175262451, "token_count": 2202, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "SIR,—As, a regular reader for nearly five years, I must congratulate you on your far-sighted leading asticle of May I. It came to me as a breeze of sanity, courage and hope after the heavy and almost stifling hothouse atmosphere created, alas, by the endless medieval platitudes about the \" guild system,\" the \" abolition of usury,\" the \" just price \" (whatever that may mean to-day), and all the stock-intrade of the doctrinaire Catholic writers on socio-economic questions.\nExcept for one or two passages that indicate some understanding of the technical approach to the central problem of industrial reconstruction, I fear that even Mr. Stanley James lucid series of articles strike one as hut an honest yet unconvincing attempt to put \" old wine into new bottles.\" To anyone familiar with the machinery of industrial administration, and its possibilities as an instrument of self-government in modern industry as a whole, neither Mr. James nor Mr. Benvenisti (with his over-insistence on the financial problem), nor the really \" Long \" answer to \" What is the Social Policy of the Catholic Church?\" given in 3 recent issue, give any indication as to how the vital problem of reconstruct' ins our industrial politico-economic system is to be tackled as a post-war fact.\nI am therefore more than glad to see that you yourself arc aware that planning has come to stay ; and that you for one realise that a planned economy is \" the obvious and inevitable solution to the social problems of the day.\" To my knowledge you are the first Catholic writer to accept this situation fearlessly and to acknowledge it as a necessary historical fact of social evolution. Since returning from the forty-fifth Oxford Management Conference I have been more than ever appalled by the guff which needlessly separates the usual run of academic Catholic thought on this subject from the eminently practical Christian thinking (of which your leading article is a grand example) of those directly concerned with the relations between employer and employee.\nHow many Catholic writers have ever seriously considered the implications of Works Councils or of Joint Production Committees? Have they ever contributed one particle of constructive thought to the basis and functioning of these instruments of co-operation as between employers and workers on the things that really matter to-day? In fact I often wonder whether Catholics are really alive to social problems. Of the 200 or so managers and managing directors of industrial concerns, ranging from the huge combine like I.C.I. to the small family-owned business, who were present at the Oxford Conference there was not one who was a Catholic.\nNow surely there are some Catholics represented in management circles in this country? If so, it was their duty to attend a conference of this nature, devoted as it was to the general theme of \" co-operation between employers and labour,\" in order that the Catholic viewpoint could be expressed. Believe me, there were opportunities galore. For example, at one of the early sessions of the conference, the chairman, a delightful, popular and typically agnostic personality, voiced his scepticism as to whether \" industry has within itself the spiritual power to create cooperation.\" Please note that even he recognised it as a spiritual problem.\nHis view was, however, that \" what industry needed now was a great leader, like Mr. Churchill after Dunkirk.\" (Shades of Main!) On the other hand, the chairman at a subsequent session, when Jack Tanner gave us the trade union point of view on industrial cooperation and the planned society of the future, emphasised that this spiritual problem could he solved by the delegates present if they would only make up their minds to put their backs into solving it. Far from confessing a disbelief in any of the great religions as a source of industrial inspiration (as the other chairman did to me privately afterwards), he spoke as a practical Christian and laid grim stress on the spiritual values underlying all human nature.\nThe point I am getting at. is this. Here were gathered together a body of industrial administrators representative of all manners and sizes of manufacturing and distributive organisations, all of whom were in agreement with Tanner that the problem they had come to discuss was,a human one—not merely one of industrial organisation as such. As a result they discussed things not in any doctrinaire fashion, but with a practical grasp coupled with vision that was impressive, to say the least. I must confess that I left Oxford feeling that this vital social problem can be left safely in the capable, sympathetic and really experienced hands of industrial management—which, after all, lies midway between shareholder and worker.\nAll of us at the Conference felt the urgency of this problem. As Sir Frederielt Leggett, the Government's Chief Industrial Commissioner, put it (amplified by a wealth of sober and convincing argument): \" Unless we solve this problem of industrial cooperation now, during the war, we shall be faced with a workers' revolution at the end of it.\" Sir Frederick made it painfully clear, moreover, that although the Government was quite neutral in the matter of co-operative machinery and its erection, yet its sympathies lay with the worker rather than with the employer.\nIt seems to me that Catholics as a whole are doing little to further the cause of true industrial democracy, either in their writings or their actions. Why should the impetus for the creation of Joint Production Committees have been left to the Communist Party?, Why could it not have come/from the ,Y.C.W. or the S.O.S. movement? How many Catholics, I wonder, could have written such a revolutionary and far-reaching article as that of Samuel Courtauld in the April issue of the Economic Journal? This great capitalist and industrialist evidently moves with the times. No doubt he has been \"converted\" by his former personnel manager, Dr. Marsden Jones, now Director of Factories under the Ministry of Supply, and one of the pioneers in the field of practical industrial so-operation. Would that there were one or two Catholics of his calibre in industry to-day!\n88. Napier Court, Hurlingham, S.W.6.\n[We think our correspondent underestimates the importance from the Christian point of view of the general framework within which practical cooperation should proceed. It is possible to make useful progress in tackling detailed problems, and yet wake up to find that the whole system has been allowed to drift into a totalitarianism. That is why the insistence on a Guild ideal, no atelier how much modified to suit present needs, remains important.— EDITOR, C.H.1", "id": "<urn:uuid:6a509af1-54bf-452c-a3cf-a908e3450ef8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/29th-may-1942/2/catholics-and-a-new-order", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9711897373199463, "token_count": 1346, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Michigan could end 'spoiled' elections with instant runoff voting\nBy Douglas Campbell\nPublished November 14th 2006 in The Detroit News\n'Tis November. Leaves are falling, Lucy snatched the football away from Charlie Brown, and Democrats are whining that the Green Party spoiled an election.\nIn the election for the Michigan Senate, Republican John Pappageorge, Democrat Andy Levin and Green Kyle McBee each received a minority of the vote in District 13, which covers part of Oakland County. Pappageorge received a plurality -- more votes than anybody else -- and will be the district's senator. Democrats say that because Levin and McBee, combined, received more votes than Pappageorge, Levin should get the Senate seat.\nI understand their disappointment, after spending close to a $1 million campaigning for this one Senate seat, including $364,600 of soft money from the Senate Democratic Fund, a similar amount from political action committees and much of the remainder from lawyers and chief executives (for a job that pays $79,650 a year).\nMinority votes don't win\nCorrect me if I'm clueless here: Which part of receiving a minority of the vote entitles you to expect to win? Some are howling that the election was \"spoiled\" because \"the left\" was divided between Democrats and Greens, and \"the right\" won the Senate seat.\nI don't see it as spoiled so much as the inevitable outcome of our first-past-the-post style of elections. Somebody wins, everybody else loses. If you earn a minority of the vote, you should expect to lose.\nOur system doesn't allocate 3 percent of the seats in Congress to parties that receive 3 percent of the vote, or there would be three Green senators and 13 Green representatives in Washington, D.C.\nMcBee accepted no soft money, corporate contributions or PAC money. It's the Green Party way - we have unilaterally implemented campaign finance reform and remain 100-percent lobbyist-free. Almost everyone wants to see obscene sums of money out of political campaigning and we have formed a new political party that does precisely that.\nBut because McBee spent less than 1 percent of what Levin did advertising in media outlets, he encountered a near-perfect news blackout from those media outlets.\nGreen's campaign reforms\nYes, the Green Party has a plan for campaign finance reform. We may be best known for protecting and restoring the natural environment, but becoming active in politics is necessary to achieve that. Wangari Maathai, recipient of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize and the founder of the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, probably says it best:\n\"It is very, very important for the world to recognize the linkage between good management of the environment, sustainable and efficient management of our environment and resources, and equitable distribution of these resources on one side, and democratic space and peace. If we are going to manage our resources sustainability, efficiently, if we are going to share them equitably, we need democratic space. It is impossible to manage resources responsibly and sustainably in a dictatorship, because in such a situation you have a few people controlling the resources at the expense of the many, and therefore, you cannot have peace. Sooner or later, you have conflict.\"\nTry new voting system\nThe United States may not be a dictatorship, but we do have a few people controlling the resources at the expense of the many.\nWe have a plan for eliminating spoiled elections, too: Instant Runoff Voting, which we've been promoting since day one. Under this system, you mark both your first and second choices. It makes it unnecessary to choose the lesser of two weasels, enables you to mark both your true preference and your fallback choice, mathematically eliminates the possibility of spoiled elections, eliminates the need for primary elections and assures no candidate is elected without a majority.\nWe just haven't found anybody in the Legislature who's interested in preventing spoiled elections.\nThe Green party is not going away, and we're not giving up.

{"text": "Erica first noticed him when they were five.\nStiles was the rowdy little five-year-old, always bouncing from one foot to the other, he was the one who brought an extra pack of crayons in case anyone forgot theirs, who would hug their teacher's legs before leaving everyday after school--and Erica knew this, because the only father who came after Stiles' to pick their kid up was her own. He was the one to split a sandwich that was already split in half in case any of the other child mentioned they were hungry and didn't have enough money for lunch. He was nice, and he may have been a little restless, but not in the way most boys were at that age. He was different.\nSomething most kids weren't.\nHe had been great, and Erica had immediately been captivated by him.\nThey'd never talked, not really, not because Erica was scared he'd give her cooties but because she was scared of rejection. Stiles didn't seem like a jerk, but Erica was only five and the thought of someone cooler than her not wanting to be her friend hurt more than the (admittedly low) possibility of him saying yes ever happening could make her happy. So she stayed away, admired from afar.\nShe'd stay like that for years.\nShe didn't mind, though, because Stiles made her happy just because he was happy.\nThe summer she turned twelve is when the seizures started happening.\nShe started to miss school more, sat in the back of the classroom when she actually went instead of sitting in the front like she used to, would sink back so she'd go unnoticed. It's not that Erica wanted it to be this way, she wanted to go out with friends and experiment with boys and be that girl that every boy wanted--the girl that Stiles wanted, but she couldn't do that when she was the poster child of a liability. She could never go out with boys, because what if she had a seizure while they were at the movies holding hands? Or worse--when they were kissing. She was already mortified enough that she had the condition, she didn't want it to relfect on her worse than it already did.\nSo, she stayed away from boys, told herself that she was saving herself the embarrassment, and them the realization that their date was a total loser. Maybe they'd find their own little personal Lydia Martin--she'd be better for them. Boys didn't want someone like Erica, someone who was sickly and weak, a girl that was so terrifed of what her condition was capable of that she could barely control herself enough not to cry in class. They needed someone like Lydia. Someone who was brave, brilliant, and beautiful.\nNo one would ever notice Erica. She wasn't a Lydia. She'd never be a Lydia.\nAnd sure, Stiles was understanding, he was too nice for his own good and had grown up with a father figure that had taught him right from wrong--explicitly--and he'd grown up as a pretty accepting person, too, but Erica didn't think Stiles would be friends with that-girl-who-seizes-because-she-has-a-disease-or-something. She wasn't so sure that his nice-guy-streak would extend as far as that.\nStiles didn't have to accept it. He didn't have to accept Erica or her condition or anything about her, really. Erica was nothing to him, had always been nothing to him--hell, Erica had never even been sure that he'd ever noticed her, let alone wanted anything to do with her.\nThe most embarrassing thing about it, though, was that she always went to Mrs. Riley in the clinic to take her medication so she wouldn't have seizures in class, and she knew that it shouldn’t be something she should be ashamed of, because it was keeping her alive and that was the best thing, for her, and for her family. But it made her feel different from other kids. It made her feel like an outsider.\nErica didn’t need another reason to be an outsider; she’d already had enough.\nBut then Stiles started coming a few months later, after his mom died.\n\"You're Erica, right?\" He asked, one afternoon when Mrs. Riley was in the other room tending to a sick kid, with some sort of flu. Erica was forced to stay in a different room, almost always, because she had a shitty immune system.\nNot that she wanted to see puke or anything, but it just felt like one more kick in the direction of invisibility. She was only twelve, and everything was melodramatic and the world was always ending, but it didn't make things easier, or better, or any of the things that her doctors and her parents had promised her.\nIt just made it more difficult, made kids stare at her in the halls and whisper about her, made some kids push her into lockers and call her Epileptic Erica, Never-Get-a-Date Erica, Earthquake-Make-the-Ground-Shake Erica--really, she’d heard them all.\nKids were assholes, but Erica eventually had just understood that it was who she was.\nBut anyway, her heart got caught in her throat and her fingers started to get clammy, kind of\nhow she sometimes felt before she had a seizure, and she almost was afraid she was about to have one before she realized it was just Stiles . Stiles made her crazy inside, made her think about things that a twelve-year-old girl shouldn't be thinking about, like first kisses and the 7th grade dance coming up, and how Stiles had always looked ridiculously good in red.\n\"Yeah,\" She whispered, voice cracking, but Stiles didn't seem to notice, and if he did--which he probably did, because sometimes Erica was convinced that Stiles noticed everything, except for her, never did he notice her--he was nice enough not to say anything--\nStiles was just--nice. Too nice, almost.\nStiles was bouncing his leg up and down, a habit that Erica knew he got when he was too tired of sitting in one place for too long, and it should've been annoying, but it was Stiles so she just found it adorable.\n\"Nice to meet you,\" he said, and then kind of flushed, like he was embarrassed about something. Probably that he was talking to her, Erica thought. \"I'm Stiles. I don't think--I've ever introduced myself to you. Sorry, about that. I wasn't--avoiding you, or anything, I just don't know what to say. I'm bad with words,\" he blabbered.\nErica bit her lip on a smile. \"That's okay. No one ever does.\"\nStiles kind of looked conflicted at that, hurt in a way that she'd never seen before, but she shrugged it off--mentally, of course, because Stiles already thought she was crazy, probably, he didn't need another reason.\nHe looked like he was about to say something, but then Mrs. Riley walked in with both of their medication bottles in hand, and handed them both theirs respectively, along with some water.\n\"Come back before the day's end, Erica, we have to talk about the new medication your doctor's putting you on,\" Mrs. Riley said, because she obviously wanted to ruin Erica's life forever .\n\"Okay,\" she answered, quietly, glancing over at Stiles, who was smiling at her slightly.\n\"That's annoying, isn't it? My doctor's always changing my ADD medication on me too.\" He grabbed his backpack after swallowing his pills, strapping it over both shoulders before waving at her slightly. \"See you around, Erica. It was nice to meet you!\"\nEveryday after that, she'd find a piece of notebook paper on her desk in Mr. Greene's class, a simple piece of notebook paper, folded and tattered around the edges like it'd been folded over and over again.\nIt was a simple piece of notebook paper and it'd always have a \"Have a great day, Erica :-) - G.\"\nShe treausred them so much she eventually had to get a box for them, had stuck them under her bed and even though they were always the same, when she was feeling especially shitty on the worst nights, she'd stay up for hours to read them all, because someone actually cared.\nAnd for Erica, that meant everything.\nTwo days into sophomore year, the letters stopped.\nTwo days into sophomore year, Stiles started to skip classes more, his grades started to slip a little, and he was perpetually sweaty.\nFour days into sophomore year, Erica realized that the letters were done for good.\nSix days into sophomore year, Erica had a seizure in class for the first time in months.\nThen Derek happened, Derek happened and he promised he’d make everything better for her, that he’d make the seizures stop and he’d make everything change and the one thing in life that Erica had ever wanted was change.\nErica wanted to stop feeling helpless and useless. She wanted to stop being the laughing stock of the school. She wanted to stop being second to Lydia Martin, she wanted to be noticed, by Stiles, by everyone.\nErica wanted what Derek could give her, and even if she wasn’t completely sure that Derek was telling the truth, she bared her throat and whispered, “yes.”\nThe morning after the bite, Erica knew the seizures wouldn’t return.\nShe felt strong in a way that she never had, strong and powerful and different.\nDerek was there, lurking in the corner of her hospital room, and she almost screamed at him, asking what he was doing here, but she didn’t, she sank back to the sheets, before looking up at him curiously.\n“What am I now?” She whispered.\nHe grinned, feral and promising, eyes flashing red. “You’re a werewolf.”\nShe almost laughed at the absurdity of it, because werewolves were the nightmares you told your stupid kid brother at night so he wouldn’t be able to sleep, they weren’t real, they were fantasy. But Erica knew Derek wasn’t lying, and it should’ve made her terrified, to think that she was the monster she used to be afraid of when she was younger, what all kids were afraid of, but it only made her swell up, with something that resembled pride.\nAnd maybe a little fear.\nBut mostly pride.\n“Will I kill anyone?” She asked.\nShe didn’t want to kill anyone.\n“No,” Derek answered, more of a snort than anything, and made the move to leave.\n“But you could,” he paused at the door, glancing at her over his shoulder, before leaving.\nShe won’t kill anyone.\nBut she could.\nIt made her feel more safe than she’d ever felt in years.\n“I need you to distract him.”\nErica rose an eyebrow in Derek’s general direction. “Pardon?”\nDerek growled, eyes flashing red, and a part of her wanted to turn belly-down on the floor. She didn't, of course, but she wanted to. “I need you to distract Stiles for a while.”\nHer heart thudded in her chest, and by the look that Derek gave her, she knew that Derek had heard it--of course he’d heard it, he heard everything, he heard how Erica had spent the first few nights in her room, hissing and shaking out on the bed, clawing at the sheets, not because she had any reason to, but because she could. Because she had control, something she hadn't had since it was ripped away from her when she was twelve, lying on the hospital bed sweating through sheets after sheets.\nDerek shrugged. “You need to hold him off and point him in a different direction. Tie him to a chair. Lock him in a closet. Just make sure he doesn’t get to that ice rink tonight.”\n“Okay,” She whispered, because she was still young, she still hadn’t realized that she’d have enough room to wiggle around with Derek, that she could poke at him and prod him and anger him without any serious repercussions.\nWhen Derek found out she wrecked Stiles’ car and knocked him out, Derek had shoved her up against a wall and had told her that taking initiative was careless and stupid and that she shouldn’t rough up a human, much less the sheriff’s son.\nShe’d pushed back, had stared at him with glowing eyes, and hissed, “you wouldn’t understand,” because he didn’t, and he never would.\nErica didn’t mean to hurt Stiles.\nShe didn’t mean to hurt him at all.\nDerek gave her protection, Derek gave her strength. Derek gave her pride and happiness and things she’d never experienced before--well, things she hadn’t experienced in a long time. So yeah, Erica may have kissed him, may have used it more as a tactic to throw him off, but she’d kissed him, with enough confidence to know that there’d been a 90% chance he’d kiss her back. It was reckless and would probably end in nothing but a pissed off Alpha and her leaving with her tail in between her legs, but Erica--\nShe wanted control, now. She wanted to stop taking orders and she wanted to shout them.\nShe wanted it and Derek was the one that she could milk it out of, at least for a couple of seconds.\nAnd it wasn’t like Erica was stupid, she wasn’t unaware, she knew how attractive she was now.\nAnd Derek had never told her, had never told her or Isaac or Boyd, but Erica knew--\nShe knew Derek had a type, and she was achingly certain blondes were included.\n(She was right; even if it only lasted a few seconds, she was right.)\nThe day in the hallway, when Stiles had cornered her to ask about Jackson’s parents, she couldn’t hide her attraction anymore.\nShe couldn’t hide how she had spent years yearning for his affection and attention without ever getting it. She couldn’t hide that because maybe she thought that there was a chance that Stiles would want it. She couldn’t pick up scents like Derek or Scott could, because Derek hadn’t taught them that, had barely taught them anything besides basic combat skills, but she could see Stiles’ mouth open in surprise whenever she came around, like he still wasn’t used to how she looked now.\nHow she would’ve looked if she had never had epilepsy.\n“I used to have the worst crush in the world on you ,” Erica says, voice cracking like it hadn’t since before she’d been turned. Stiles had simply blinked at her, like he didn’t believe her. “Yes, you, Stiles.”\nAnd for a moment, for a moment she let herself believe that she’d gotten through to him, that he had seen her for her , for what she’d been trying to to show him all along.\n“And you never noticed me,” Erica laughed, after Stiles made no move to say anything, but it was humorless, falling dry in her throat. “Like how you’re not noticing me now.”\nAfter Jackson attacked her, when they brought her to Derek, Erica focused on how Stiles’ heart was beating like a hummingbird’s in his chest, how Erica might even be inclined to call it out of fear, fear for her safety, for her life .\nShe’d finally gotten his attention.\nAnd it was because she was dying .\n“Is she dying?” Stiles asked, sounding panicked and on-edge and Erica would’ve smiled if she could have.\nBecause he cared.\nHe showed something for her.\nHe didn’t want her to die.\n“Stiles, you'd make a good batman,” she said, reaching up with a hand to grasp his flannel shirt sleeve.\nShe didn’t have to look to notice Derek’s glare.\nShe didn’t have to have a superior senses to smell how angry Derek was.\nShe didn’t know how she knew, but in that moment, she knew Stiles would never be hers.\nHe already belonged to someone else.\nEighty-three days into sophomore year, she found a letter on her desk, again.\n\"Batman always needs some backup. - G\"\nErica, despite herself, smiled.", "id": "<urn:uuid:062c3496-aec6-4845-a1b3-42e8db05134d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://archiveofourown.org/works/456027", "date": "2013-05-18T08:03:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.992565393447876, "token_count": 3635, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "ACLU fights residency law for hiring\nA lawsuit says the state should not limit employees to current or former residents\nA law that requires applicants for most public-sector jobs to be current or former Hawaii residents at the time of application is adversely affecting both non-residents seeking employment and the state government, a civil rights group contends.\n\"Damage from the pre-employment residency requirement runs not just to plaintiffs ... but also to the public interest of Hawaii's residents because (agencies) are unable to fill positions that are necessary for a well-equipped government,\" the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii said in a court motion filed yesterday. The motion seeks a preliminary injunction to stop enforcement of the residency requirements until the issue can be decided by the courts.\nIn July the ACLU sued the state and the City and County of Honolulu on behalf of two Florida men who said their applications for various state and county jobs were rejected solely because of the residency requirements. The federal lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, contends the residency requirements are unconstitutional and penalize nonresidents.\nAttorney General Mark Bennett has said he believes the state law, upon which county hiring policies are based, is constitutional and that he will defend it, but he acknowledges the issue is an \"open question\" that never has been definitively decided by the courts.\nCity officials have declined comment on the lawsuit.\nThe ACLU contends plaintiffs Blane M. Wilson of Pensacola and Kevin R. Walsh of Tallahassee have suffered irreparable harm, not being able to apply for work in Hawaii.

Catholic has received more and more offers to add to his list that has now exceeded twenty; with USC and Clemson among his most recent offers.\nAnother program that liked what they saw in the No. 18 overall prospect in the country was the Oklahoma Sooners who offered as well a little over a week ago.\nThe majority of the 2012 class that the Sooners signed haven't even stepped foot on campus but that doesn't mean they aren't already recruiting for the Crimson and Cream. The thing is the Sooner signee that's been talking with Isaac plays the same position as the Joliet Catholic product.\n\"Obviously they are winners, they have won a lot. I've talked to one of their running backs that they got for 2012, David Smith. Obviously we are from the same general area. He said it was pretty nice out there and to definitely check it out. I take his word, if I can I can,\" Isaac said.\nOklahoma's running backs coach, Cale Gundy is responsible for recruiting Isaac. Though they have not met in person Isaac says Gundy has made a good first impression.\n\"He's been real straight up about everything. He seems like a good guy. Obviously meeting someone in person is what you want to do but good first impression for sure,\" he said.\nAcademically Isaac is doing well with a 3.1 GPA and says he has not taken the SAT yet. Last season on the gridiron Isaac had a monster year finishing with 203 carries for 2629 yards, and 51 touchdowns.\nBeing as big and fast as Isaac is and playing running back some might say he has an advantage at the high school level. That may be true but Isaac hasn't allowed himself to think his size and speed alone will get the job done, which is especially true when at the next level.\n\"Obviously I have some weight behind me to do some things. When we are playing the game I'm not thinking I've got to play like a big back, I know something that I have really tried to get myself to do is get low especially when you are playing in crowded areas is get low,\" he said. \"So, it wouldn't necessarily be like oh he's running straight up you know I get down low, get behind my pads and just run hard and do whatever is necessary to get wherever I need to.\"\nWith all the prestigious programs that have offered Isaac the talented running back is aware that each will have impressive facilities on their campus but he is looking for more than that.\n\"At this point all these big programs have all got great facilities, and good things about them. Definitely, the people will set apart a school and just a general feel when on campus.\"\nIsaac says he would like to play in a pro-style offense at the next level.\nArizona State NEWS", "id": "<urn:uuid:4831f6e2-a4f0-4898-8563-c1b0f08101c8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://arizonastate.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1339165", "date": "2013-05-18T05:31:47Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9851552844047546, "token_count": 666, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

(The full list of those products is listed in the Official Rules.) The announcement states:\n“This contest, launched in 2007, is a way for promising start-ups to get noticed and compete for an opportunity to win some great rewards for your start-up. This year’s challenge offers prizes such as $100K in combined cash and credits for multiple winners, VC introductions, PR support, and more. If your start-up is built using AWS, we want you to apply!”\nThe write up goes on to give some specifics on the rewards Amazon will shower upon the winning contestant. You can see the entire list here, but opportunity and publicity are perhaps the most promising. The announcement mentions:\n“Meet Tier One Investors: At last year’s event, finalists met 1:1 with representatives from top VCs such as Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, NEA, Accel and Madrona Venture Group.

E de fato, era assim:\nParticle physics is a branch of physics that studies the elementary particle|elementary subatomic constituents of matter and radiation, and their interactions. The field is also called high energy physics, because many elementary particles do not occur under ambient conditions on Earth. They can only be created artificially during high energy collisions with other particles in particle accelerators.\nParticle physics has evolved out of its parent field of nuclear physics and is typically still taught in close association with it. Scientific research in this area has produced a long list of particles.\nMas hein? Partículas que só podem ser criadas em aceleradores? Física de partículas é ensinada junto com física nuclear? A pesquisa produz partículas (essa é ótima!)?\nEm que mundo essa pessoa vive? Reescrevi:\nParticle Physics is a branch of physics that studies the existence and interactions of particles, which are the constituents of what is usually referred as matter or radiation. In our current understanding, particles are excitations of quantum fields and interact following their dynamics. Most of the interest in this area is in fundamental fields, those that cannot be described as a bound state of other fields.

{"text": "- published: 19 Mar 2013\n- views: 42\n- author: T.A. B\npossibly testing on weans, that worries me http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21849808.\nA vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and \"remember\" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated; see cancer vaccine).\nThe term vaccine derives from Edward Jenner's 1796 use of cow pox (Latin variola vaccinia, adapted from the Latin vaccīn-us, from vacca, cow), to inoculate humans, providing them protection against smallpox.\nVaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease. Sometimes, this is because the host's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all. This may be due to a lowered immunity in general (diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection, age) or because the host's immune system does not have a B cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen.\nEven if the host develops antibodies, the human immune system is not perfect and in any case the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection immediately. In this case, the infection will be less severe and heal faster.\nAdjuvants are typically used to boost immune response. Most often aluminium adjuvants are used, but adjuvants like squalene are also used in some vaccines and more vaccines with squalene and phosphate adjuvants are being tested. Larger doses are used in some cases for older people (50–75 years and up), whose immune response to a given vaccine is not as strong.\nThe efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on a number of factors:\nWhen a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against, the disease is likely to be milder than without vaccination.\nThe following are important considerations in the effectiveness of a vaccination program:\nIn 1958 there were 763,094 cases of measles and 552 deaths in the United States. With the help of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56). In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. 54 out of 64 infections were associated with importation from another country, although only 13% were actually acquired outside of the United States; 63 of these 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles, or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.\nVaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them.\nThere are several types of vaccines in use. These represent different strategies used to try to reduce risk of illness, while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response.\nSome vaccines contain killed, but previously virulent, micro-organisms that have been destroyed with chemicals, heat, radioactivity or antibiotics. Examples are the influenza vaccine, cholera vaccine, bubonic plague vaccine, polio vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, and rabies vaccine.\nSome vaccines contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many of these are live viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or which use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps and the bacterial disease typhoid. The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a contagious strain, but contains a virulently modified strain called \"BCG\" used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain Yersinia pestis EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They have the capacity of transient growth so they give prolonged protection, and no booster dose is required. But they may get reverted to the virulent form and cause the disease.\nToxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. Toxoid vaccines are known for their efficacy. Not all toxoids are for micro-organisms; for example, Crotalus atrox toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites.\nProtein subunit – rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated micro-organism to an immune system (which would constitute a \"whole-agent\" vaccine), a fragment of it can create an immune response. Examples include the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients, but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast), the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) that is composed of the viral major capsid protein, and the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus. Subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization.\nConjugate – certain bacteria have polysaccharide outer coats that are poorly immunogenic. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g. toxins), the immune system can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen. This approach is used in the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine.\nA number of innovative vaccines are also in development and in use:\nWhile most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from micro-organisms, synthetic vaccines are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates or antigens.\nVaccines may be monovalent (also called univalent) or multivalent (also called polyvalent). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism. A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms. In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.\nThe immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the virulent version of an agent comes along the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) by recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.\nWhen two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin polio vaccine, where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the \"take\" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine. This phenomenon has also been found to be a problem with the dengue vaccines currently being researched,[when?] where the DEN-3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN-1, -2 and -4 serotypes.\nVaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases known to man. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of four countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan). The difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings, however, have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.\nIn order to provide best protection, children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional \"booster\" shots often required to achieve \"full immunity\". This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia. The large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.\nBesides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters, many specific vaccines are recommended at other ages or for repeated injections throughout life—most commonly for measles, tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia. Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended in the U.S. (as of 2011) and UK (as of 2009). Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza, which are more deadly to that group. In 2006, a vaccine was introduced against shingles, a disease caused by the chickenpox virus, which usually affects the elderly.\nSometime during the 1770s Edward Jenner heard a milkmaid boast that she would never have the often-fatal or disfiguring disease smallpox, because she had already had cowpox, which has a very mild effect in humans. In 1796, Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, inoculated an 8-year-old boy with it, and six weeks later variolated the boy's arm with smallpox, afterwards observing that the boy did not catch smallpox. Further experimentation demonstrated the efficacy of the procedure on an infant. Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation, the latter, though still widely practiced in England, was banned in 1840. Louis Pasteur generalized Jenner's idea by developing what he called a rabies vaccine, and in the nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.\nThe twentieth century saw the introduction of several successful vaccines, including those against diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s. Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century. As vaccines became more common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including malaria and HIV.\n||The neutrality of this section is disputed. Please see the discussion on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved. (October 2011)|\n||This article is missing information about Scientific rebuttal to the attacks. This concern has been noted on the talk page where whether or not to include such information may be discussed. (October 2011)|\nOpposition to vaccination, from a wide array of vaccine critics, has existed since the earliest vaccination campaigns. Although the benefits of preventing suffering and death from serious infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following immunization, disputes have arisen over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, and safety of vaccination. Some vaccination critics say that vaccines are ineffective against disease or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate. Some religious groups do not allow vaccination, and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty. In response, concern has been raised that spreading unfounded information about the medical risks of vaccines increases rates of life-threatening infections, not only in the children whose parents refused vaccinations, but also in other children, perhaps too young for vaccines, who could contract infections from unvaccinated carriers (see herd immunity).\nOne challenge in vaccine development is economic: many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases, because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.\nMost vaccine development to date has relied on \"push\" funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations. Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health. The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades.[when?] This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support, rather than economic incentive.\nThe filing of patents on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines. Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product, the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used on the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy.\nVaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza), or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Alternatively, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.\nVaccine production techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.\nIn 2010, India produced 60 percent of world's vaccine worth about $900 million.\nMany vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection that, in one 1928 incident, killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Several preservatives are available, including thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, has better shelf life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety, but in the U.S., the European Union, and a few other affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content. Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims.\nThere are several new delivery systems in development[when?] that will hopefully make vaccines more efficient to deliver. Possible methods include liposomes and ISCOM (immune stimulating complex).\nThe latest developments[when?] in vaccine delivery technologies have resulted in oral vaccines. A polio vaccine was developed and tested by volunteer vaccinations with no formal training; the results were positive in that the ease of the vaccines increased. With an oral vaccine, there is no risk of blood contamination. Oral vaccines are likely to be solid which have proven to be more stable and less likely to freeze; this stability reduces the need for a \"cold chain\": the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines. A microneedle approach, which is still in stages of development, uses \"pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin\".\nA nanopatch is a needle free vaccine delivery system which is under development. A stamp-sized patch similar to an adhesive bandage contains about 20,000 microscopic projections per square inch. When worn on the skin, it will deliver vaccine directly to the skin, which has a higher concentration of immune cells than that in the muscles, where needles and syringes deliver. It thus increases the effectiveness of the vaccination using a lower amount of vaccine used in traditional syringe delivery system.\nThe use of plasmids has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.\nVaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans. Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated. In some instances, wild populations may be vaccinated. This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine-laced food spread in a disease-prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons.\nWhere rabies occurs, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease among others.\nVaccine development has several trends:\nPrinciples that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure. Factors that have impact on the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine, demographics, regulatory science, political, cultural, and social responses.\n|Modern Vaccine and Adjuvant Production and Characterization, Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News|\nThe World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy.

{"text": "WASHINGTON -- As the House begins to debate a major overhaul of the campaign finance system, special-interest groups are opening the floodgates and spending big money to try to preserve their right to spend big money on campaigns.\nFrom the National Right to Life Committee to the American Civil Liberties Union to huge corporations, Capitol Hill has been blitzed by phone calls, letters, advertisements and faxes arguing that the legislation would infringe on their right to express political opinions.\n\"We're open, and we're loud, and we're very clear how we feel about this,\" said Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. \"What's at stake is what type of political society we live under in the 21st century -- whether we live in a society where men and women can get together and express a point of view or whether we're going to turn over the keys to the national media conglomerates.\"\nRelenting to pressure from more than 200 members who signed a petition supporting campaign finance legislation, House Republican leaders will bring to the House floor tomorrow up to 16 campaign finance bills.\nThe debate will turn on the two most prominent bills, both of which are designed to curtail \"soft money,\" the unregulated and unlimited contributions to political parties from unions, corporations and wealthy individuals.\nThe tougher of the two bills, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, and Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, would ban soft money to both state and national parties. The other bill, sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of first-term representatives, would restrict donations only to national party organizations; soft money could still go to state parties, which could then funnel the money to federal candidates.\nThe Shays-Meehan bill, identical to a Senate version sponsored by John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, would also ban political ads paid for by independent interest groups in the last 60 days of a campaign, if the ad mentioned a candidate by name. Groups that paid for such ads would have to disclose their donors.\n\"It's not a matter of their voices being denied,\" Shays said. \"It's a matter of disclosure. The truth is, right now, they can say outrageous things about anybody, and they have no accountability.\"\nA final vote will likely come in June. In the Senate, Republican leaders have said resolutely that they do not plan to revisit the campaign finance issue this year.\nHouse Republican leaders have also made clear that they will oppose new limits on campaign donations, making passage a long shot. The way they have structured the debate also presents a significant new hurdle. Members can split their votes among any number of competing versions, allowing them all to fail for lack of a majority, and still claim they supported reform. Even Shays concedes that fewer than half the House members back real reform.\nOpponents of the bills are as united as ever. The Christian Coalition, for example, has made campaign finance reform one of its \"key issues.\" It has listed a candidate's position on campaign reform on the coalition's congressional score cards, which are stuffed into church pews and sent to nearly 2 million people.\n\"What's going on here is first and foremost an attack on the First Amendment free-speech rights of people to organize into interest groups and express themselves,\" said Arne Owens, a Christian Coalition spokesman.\nThe National Association of Broadcasters has written to every member of Congress and mobilized its member companies to oppose any free or reduced-rate air time for candidates. That proposal, which some lawmakers plan to introduce as an amendment, is intended to lower the cost of campaigns and make aggressive fund-raising less necessary.\nThe National Association of Business Political Action Committees has asked the 20 million Americans who donate to PACs to write or call their representatives. The group also plans to launch an advertising campaign this week opposing reform bills.\n\"We're spending money to protect the right of 20 million Americans to participate in the political process in the way they choose,\" said Steve Stockmeyer, the group's chief lobbyist.\nAnd the National Rifle Association is rustling up its considerable grass roots, denouncing reform bills on radio talk shows and sending lobbyists to Capitol Hill.\nYet even as they fight to preserve the campaign finance system, some donors are quietly growing tired of a process that is extracting more and more of their money to finance political campaigns. General Motors, Monsanto, AlliedSignal and Tenneco have halted donations of soft money. Charles S. Mack, president of the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, said other companies are exploring the option. If the trend catches on, the groundswell may do more to change the political system than any legislation out of Washington.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a17606ca-cad2-4b84-9179-bc6775488413>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-05-20/news/1998140068_1_campaign-finance-soft-money-house-republican-leaders", "date": "2013-05-18T06:47:09Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.96440190076828, "token_count": 966, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Wars have given us the Jeep, the computer and even the microwave.\nWill the war in Iraq give us the Tiger?\nMilitary scientists at Edgewood Chemical Biological Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground hope so. The machine - its full name is the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery - combines a chute, an engine, chemical tanks and other components, giving it the appearance of a lunar rover. It's designed to turn food and waste into fuel. If it works, it could save scores of American and Iraqi lives.\nAmong the biggest threats that soldiers face in the war in Iraq are the roadside bombs that have killed or maimed thousands since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Because some military bases lack a landfill, transporting garbage to dumps miles away in the desert has become a potentially fatal routine for U.S. troops and military contractors.\nThe Tiger would attempt to solve two problems at once: It would sharply reduce those trash hauls and provide the military with an alternative source of fuel.\nIt is the latest in a long line of wartime innovations, from can openers to desert boots. The conflict in Iraq has produced innovations such as \"warlocks,\" which jam electronic signals from cell phones, garage door openers and other electronic devices that insurgents use to detonate roadside bombs, according to Inventors Digest.\n\"In wartime, you're not worried about making a profit necessarily. You're worried about getting the latest technology on the street,\" said Peter Kindsvatter, a military historian at Aberdeen Proving Ground, who added that money is spent more freely for research when a nation is at war. \"Basically, you find yourself in a technology race with your enemy.\"\nThe Tiger, now being tested in Baghdad, would not be the first device to turn garbage into energy - a large incinerator near Baltimore's downtown stadiums does it. But it would be among the first to attempt to do it on a small scale. Its creators say it could one day become widely used in civilian life, following the lead of other wartime innovations.\nDuring World War II, contractors developed the Jeep to meet the military's desire for a light, all-purpose vehicle that could transport supplies.\nThe development of radar technology to spot Nazi planes led to the microwave, according to historians.\nThe World War II era also gave birth to the first electronic digital computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC. Funded by the Defense Department, the machine was built to compute ballistics tables that soldiers used to mechanically aim large guns. For years it was located at Aberdeen Proving Ground.\nThis decade, the Pentagon determined that garbage on military bases poses a serious logistical problem.\n\"When you're over in a combat area and people are shooting at you, you still have to deal with your trash,\" said John Spiller, project officer with the Army's Rapid Equipping Force, which is funding the Tiger project. \"How would you feel if somebody was shooting at you every other time you pushed it down the curb?\"\nHe and other Army officials said they could not recall any specific attacks against troops or contractors heading to dumpsites.For years, large incinerators have burned trash to generate power. Baltimore Refuse Energy Systems Co., the waste-to-energy plant near the stadiums, consumes up to 2,250 tons of refuse a day while producing steam and electricity.\nThe process is so expensive that it has only made sense to do it on a large scale, scientists say.\nThe military has spent almost $3 million on two Tiger prototypes, each weighing nearly 5 tons and small enough to fit into a 20- to 40-foot wide container. The project is being developed by scientists from the Edgewood, Va.-based Defense Life Sciences LLC and Indiana's Purdue University.\nThe biggest challenge was getting the parts to work together, said Donald Kennedy, an Edgewood spokesman. Because the Tiger is a hybrid consisting of a gasifier, bioreactor and generator, much of it is built with off-the-shelf items, including a grinder.\nAnother big challenge: expectations.\n\"When we would initially talk to people about the Tiger system, a large percentage would refuse to believe it could actually work,\" Kennedy wrote in an e-mail. \"Alternatively, a similar percentage would be so intrigued by the idea that they would demand to know when they could buy one for their neighborhood.\"\nThe Tiger works like this: A shredder rips up waste and soaks it in water. A bioreactor metabolizes the sludge into ethanol. A pelletizer compresses undigested waste into pellets that are fed into a gasification unit, which produces composite gas.\nThe ethanol, composite gas and a 10-percent diesel drip are injected into a diesel generator to produce electricity, according to scientists. It takes about six hours for the Tiger to power up. When it works, the device can power a 60-kilowatt generator.\nThe prototypes are being tested at Camp Victory in Baghdad\nInitial runs proved successful. The prototypes have been used to power an office trailer. At their peak, they could power two to three trailers.\nIn recent weeks, the scientists suffered a setback: The above-100 degree temperatures caused a chiller device to overheat and shut off occasionally. A new chiller from Edgewood just arrived at the site, Kennedy said.\nAfter the 90-day testing phase that ends Aug. 10, the Army will decide whether to fund the project further.\nIts developers envision the device being used to respond to crises such as Hurricane Katrina, when there is no lack of garbage but a great need for electricity.\nSpiller, of the Army's Rapid Equipping Force, said he is optimistic.\n\"The mere fact we wrote a check means we think it's got a high chance of success,\" Spiller said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:749f4f2e-01bf-42ab-ac03-1dfa84af34dc>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-07-21/news/0807200131_1_garbage-aberdeen-proving-ground-war-in-iraq", "date": "2013-05-18T07:16:57Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9598866701126099, "token_count": 1205, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Then and now, there is ample proof that Americans do take Supreme Court nominations seriously. With good reason.\nSooner or later, the nation's most vexing disagreements over our most vital issues wind up before the Supreme Court. None quite penetrates to the core of our democratic being more than those involving First Amendment rights and values.\nEach term, the nine justices must grapple with profound questions involving freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom to participate in political discourse: Just how free is freedom of speech? What is the role of religion in public life? Does national security trump the public's right to know?\nDuring the Court's last three terms, the First Amendment has not fared well. The high court has accepted for review far fewer free-expression-related cases than usual and it has been unusually stingy in recognizing First Amendment claims. In only two of the 15 decisions rendered in free-expression cases did the Court sustain those claims.\nHow the First Amendment will fare in the future depends on how Chief Justice John Roberts differs from his predecessor, William Rehnquist, and how Miers, if confirmed, differs from O'Connor.\nDuring his 33 years on the Court as an associate justice and chief justice, Rehnquist consistently voted against free-speech and free-press claims. O'Connor, however, played a pivotal role during her time as justice, frequently casting the decisive fifth vote in religion cases and occasionally in expression cases.\nThe justices over the next 12 months will hear arguments, review briefs and render opinions in several cases that have direct bearing on whether we have full or constricted freedoms when we wish to play a role in the crucial political, cultural or religious issues that confront us.\nIn five cases, the Court will once more take up the question of whether state laws regulating campaign contributions and expenditures pose an unconstitutional threat to political expression: Is money speech?\nThe issues of compelled speech and government funding of speech are raised in another case. A coalition of university law schools which object to the military's ban against acknowledged homosexuals contends that requiring them to allow military recruiters on campus violates their rights.\nAnother case tests the limits of the free exercise of religion. The justices will decide whether the federal government can prohibit a small group of followers of a Brazilian religious sect in New Mexico from importing a banned substance, a hallucinogenic tea, for use in its ceremonies.\nIn a case involving anti-abortion protests appearing before the Court for the third time since 1986, the justices' ruling could affect protest and picketing rights and practices.\nAnd a Los Angeles deputy district attorney wants the Court to declare that his free-speech rights were violated when he was disciplined for informing a defense attorney about ethical problems in a pending case.\nThe confirmation process for Miers should be complete by the end of the year. At present, chances seem good that she will be confirmed. Since 1789, the Senate has rejected only 34 of 155 nominations to the Supreme Court.\nNot much is known about Roberts' views on these issues; even less about Miers'. First Amendment advocates, of course, hope they set the new Court on a new course as far as free expression is concerned. In that regard, Justice Brandeis set a great example as a First Amendment champion during his 23 years on the Supreme Court.\n\"Those who won our independence,\" he wrote in 1927, \"believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.\"\nThe cause of liberty would be better served if this Court's future rulings transcend individual temperament and ideology to embrace the freedom for speech and the tolerance for belief that define a vital democracy.\nEditor's note: Paul K.

{"text": "Radisson Hotel Corp. is negotiating the purchase of a Near North Side site for a luxury hotel to open in early 1987, it was learned Monday.\nIf negotiations are successful and the hotel is built, it would be Radisson`s first downtown since it terminated a management agreement in late 1982 for the Radisson Chicago Hotel, now the Hotel Continental, 505 N. Michigan Ave.\nWilliam Hanley, vice president of marketing for the Minneapolis-based innkeeper, said Radisson hopes to begin construction this summer and open the hotel in early 1987. He declined to say exactly where the hotel may be built.\nThe new hotel is expected to have approximately 300 rooms, a health club, specialty restaurant and premium-priced concierge floors that would offer a higher level of service than elsewhere in the building, Hanley said.\nRadisson is returning to Chicago as part of long-range plans to expand nationwide to 139 hotels totaling 36,000 rooms by 1989 from 41 hotels with 12,100 rooms currently, Hanley said.\nThe firm`s plans locally call for the downtown facility; an all-suite hotel in west suburban Downers Grove, which would open ahead of the Near North hotel as Radisson`s first newly built property in the metropolitan area; the acquisition of an existing suburban property to be operated as a conventional hotel; and construction of two more hotels in the suburbs, he said.\nThe five facilities would contain 1,300 to 1,500 rooms, Hanley said.\nThe Downers Grove facility will be a 256-unit, $28 million ``Radisson Suites`` hotel at Wood Creek Drive and Butterfield Road in the Wood Creek Office Park, according to Walden Investment Corp. of Schaumburg.\nWalden Investment has started construction and expects to open the facility in the summer of 1986, said Herman S. Hefler, director of hotel operations for Walden. Walden`s Entrust Hotel Management Corp. affiliate will operate it under a franchise agreement with Radisson.\nThe 7-story building, designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, will have six floors of suites overlooking a skylighted, interior atrium; an indoor pool; exercise room; game room; sauna; valet and room service; and meeting facilities, Hefler said.\nEach suite will average 500 square feet, ``approximately double that of a conventional hotel room,`` and have a separate living room with microwave oven, refrigerator, wet bar, sofa-bed, dining-conference table, television and telephone, Hefler said.\nHefler said his firm also hopes to obtain franchises to build and operate Radisson Suites in north suburban Glenview and near O`Hare International Airport.\nHefler and Hanley declined to say exactly where in the suburbs the new hotels would be built, nor would Hanley identify the existing hotel now under negotiation.\nRadisson`s new all-suite line is patterned after its 96-unit Radisson Henley Park Hotel in Washington and the 126-unit Radisson Suite Hotel in Ogden, Utah, both of which officially opened in January, Hanley said.\n``We`ll probably have about five (all-suite hotels) totaling about 1,100 rooms in operation nationally by the beginning of 1986,`` he said.\nThe facilities will open in areas containing concentrations of high-technology companies and national and regional corporate headquarters, ``where you`d experience a fair amount of training programs and people coming in for longer stays,`` Hanley said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:89b3d430-8ea0-4fea-b8ca-f559f50993a6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-03-12/business/8501140340_1_conventional-hotel-all-suite-two-more-hotels", "date": "2013-05-18T07:27:19Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9442341923713684, "token_count": 736, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "LENINGRAD — Imagine George Washington as hateful.\nImagine a campaign to rename Washington, D.C., as the most cherished political hope of residents in the nation`s capital.\nImagine the Founding Fathers discredited and in disgrace, blamed rather than praised for the American Revolution, while the new president and his Congress scurry to rewrite the Constitution and the history books to keep the country from disintegrating into 50 independent states. Imagine National Guard tanks already on patrol in several state capitals to keep the peace.\nThen imagine trying to grow up in this atmosphere of shattered ideology and faith, and you might just be able to understand why I see a crisis in Soviet youth.\nIt is a quiet crisis, because its manifestation is apathy and studied indifference toward everything but the most personal concerns.\nLiving in Leningrad for the past half-year, I have spent a great deal of time with teenagers and young adults, going to school with them, hanging out after school with them, and talking, talking, talking with them.\nThey are the Soviet ``Lost Generation.``\nAt a Leningrad high school, I was talking about belief with a 16-year-old who immediately responded that her age group ``could best be described as nihilists.``\nHer parents` generation grew up with a comforting belief that dictator Joseph Stalin saved the nation from the Nazis and rebuilt its economy. But youth raised during glasnost know the truth about his labor camps, show trials and mass executions.\n``For us, there was no way we could believe in Stalin, since I, for instance, began hearing the truth about Stalin when I was 7-my father told me,`` she said.\nIndifference is the primary characteristic of contemporary teenagers, as one parent related to me. This indifference is selective, protective, directed at Soviet society, politics and economics, which have never evinced any interest in improving young people`s lives, but only in complicating them.\nThus, young Leningraders` indifference toward their own society is paired with a thirst not only for information about the West but also for the life there. Nearly without exception, Soviets aged 16 to 26 hate politics and only want a better life.\nOne variation of this attitude manifests itself in a desire to emigrate, mostly seen in those over 18 and out of school. They distrust their political system and its politicians, and thus have no desire to participate. Recent bloodshed in the Baltics and the insulting monetary reform, in which people`s life`s savings were wiped out overnight, only reinforced this distrust.\nThose who do participate in political life are a small minority. They join such fringe groups as the Monarchists-who call for the return of the czarist autocracy-or Anarchists-who believe that having no system is better than having one.\nThere are several preservationist movements, with more wholesome platforms, in which young people participate, one dedicated to the\narchitectural renaissance of Leningrad and another whose politics parallel the West European Greens Party.\nThe Komsomol, or Young Communist League, like an ideological Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, has a dwindling cadre. Participation once was a prerequisite for future professional standing, but today its members remain more from inertia than interest.\nA 16-year-old told me she is still a komsomolka, but only because she retains a membership card. There are rarely meetings these days, and she never attends.\nSteps toward a market economy and private property also brought changes in Soviet youth. Some young Leningraders doubt the value of finishing their higher education at technical or professional institutes, or of ever working officially at all if they have obtained their decrees.\nThanks to the current inflation, they have seen their parents` salaries becoming laughably insufficient, and realize they would be better off at semi- legal biznes-or even plying the illegal black market-than trusting the system that betrayed their parents.\nYoung speculators who bribe their way into possession of scarce consumer goods at government prices resell them at a price 10 times higher, netting in one day more than an honest worker makes in a month. One 25-year-old told me he dropped out of an engineering institute because he can earn more as a private car mechanic in the shadow economy. And black marketeers, who often earn their profits in Western currencies, live the most golden life of all, even if it is totally illegal.\nThese are the new hero-workers of Soviet society.\nThe cultural effects on Soviet teenagers of the current social transformations tend to be more subtle. For ethnic Russians, their identity is reinforced by joining the recently unfettered Orthodox Church; last January, the Russian Orthodox Christmas was officially celebrated for the first time in 74 years. One teen told me she even was christened last fall-at her own intitiative.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8062d160-06b6-4983-98b6-ba363d5a0361>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-26/news/9101180458_1_soviet-youth-leningrad-quiet-crisis", "date": "2013-05-18T05:31:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9697725772857666, "token_count": 1002, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "It would be a cinch for retirees to figure out how much money they can spend without running out if they could count on their investments growing at a set rate each year.\nBut as the past 18 months have reminded investors, the market is not only unpredictable, but can go down, too.\nCalculating how much money to draw out of a retirement nest egg each year is complicated. It can even be harder than saving for retirement, experts said.\n\"You have more variables to contend with,\" said Christopher L. Jones, executive vice president with Financial Engines. How much to withdraw depends on the amount saved, taxes, life expectancy, what portion is in stocks or bonds, and whether the money is in tax-deferred accounts or not, he said.\nAnd there's timing. Retire just as a bear market hits and your nest egg will shrink a lot faster than the portfolio of someone lucky enough to retire in a bull market.\nFinancial planners say people often assume that they can safely withdraw 8 percent to 10 percent a year from invested assets throughout retirement, excluding what they receive from pensions and Social Security. That's about twice the rate generally recommended.\nChristine Fahlund, a senior financial planner with T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, said she's often greeted with skepticism at seminars when she suggests a 4 percent or 5 percent initial withdrawal rate from a portfolio, with slight increases thereafter to keep up with inflation.\nHer audience tends to become more accepting when she explains the huge hit that their portfolios will take if they withdraw 8 percent from a portfolio that's fallen 3 percent. \"We are getting a lot of believers now that the market is down,\" she said.\nSo, how does a retiree figure a realistic withdrawal rate?\nFortunately, planning in recent years has become more sophisticated than just basing withdrawals on a projected average annual return and average inflation rate.\nComputers now run portfolios and withdrawals through hundreds and thousands of economic scenarios and tell retirees the likelihood of their money lasting in retirement.\nPrice offers its free online version, the Retirement Income Calculator, at www.troweprice.com. Financial Engines next year will launch technology that shows retirees how much to invest, how much to draw down and from what accounts based on assets and income, including Social Security and pensions.\nIf you are trying to determine a withdrawal rate, here are some factors to consider:\n- Life expectancy. This depends on a person's health, gender and family history of longevity. Generally, people are living longer and need to plan for that.\nRockville, Md., financial planner Marvin Burt said a decade ago that he would use a life expectancy of 85 when developing retirement plans. He later upped that to 90 and recently started using 95. Couples must factor in the life expectancy of each partner, especially if one is much younger than the other, he said.\n- Asset allocation. Retirees should have at least 25 percent of their portfolio invested in stocks to help keep up with inflation, but probably no more than 70 percent in equities, Fahlund said.\nStocks add volatility to a portfolio, and investing too heavily in them can exacerbate the effects of a down market.\n\"You'll find the volatility can work against you over time,\" Fahlund said. \"You might have to withdraw a little less than you can if you are well-balanced.\"\nAlso, avoid the mistake of trying to make up for a lack of saving by aggressive investing, which can backfire, warned Jack Brod, head of Vanguard Advisory Services in Malvern, Pa.\nSome retirees with long life expectancies also may want to consider buying an annuity as part of their portfolio to provide a lifelong income stream, suggested Jones.\n- Timing. Not only how much you take out each year matters, but whether you start tapping into your nest egg in an up or down market can be critical.\n\"The worst thing is to have a big market downturn early on in your retirement. That will affect all future years,\" Jones said.\nTake the case of a retiree who assumes an annual return of 9 percent on a $500,000 portfolio and withdraws about 7 percent the first year, increasing that yearly for inflation. Based on a portfolio of 60 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 10 percent cash, the retiree would run out of money in 25 years if the market performed according to plan, according to a calculation by Price.\nBut what if that person retired in 1973, just as the market headed into two years of negative returns? Using actual market returns, Price found that the retiree would run out of money about six years ahead of schedule if no adjustment to withdrawals was made.\nHowever, if the retiree started out with a more conservative withdrawal rate or reduced withdrawals after the bear market, he or she would have wound up with a hefty portfolio balance after 23 years because of the bull market.", "id": "<urn:uuid:19b9d6c9-6af7-46b5-8a62-6b8a623b4861>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-11-20/business/0111200175_1_withdrawal-rate-thousands-of-economic-scenarios-retirement-income-calculator", "date": "2013-05-18T06:56:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9679765701293945, "token_count": 1009, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

But the exhibit -- plus the 12-year old \"Holidays of Light,\" which showcases celebrations such as Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and Diwali -- also acts as a portal to other attractions. Its location on the main floor (the museum's third floor) sits near old favorites like the coal mine and newer ones such as \"Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination.\" The trees may be better suited for older kids and adults who would enjoy the sight of pickle and spider-web ornaments, while younger kids might have more fun at the hatchery, watching baby chicks emerge from their shells.\nPrice: Included with general admission ($11 for adults, $9.50 for seniors, $7 for children ages 3-11).\nDaley Plaza and Christkindlmarket\nBest for: Multigenerational, Family-friendly, First-timers, Singles, Romantic couples, Budget, Sightseers\nFigure in: 2 hours to browse through the huts and nosh on Germany's many encased meats.\nGeography: 50 W. Washington St.; 312-494-2175. Less than 5-minute walk (.17 miles) from \"Holiday Central.\" Walk 2 blocks north.\nWhat to know: One day, the Food and Drug Administration should pay a visit to the Christkindlmarket at the Daley Plaza. They'd find the perfect cure for cold, blustery days in leberkase (topped here with mustard and served on a kaiser roll). Chase that with a cup of gluhwein (a hot spiced wine) and let the warmth envelop you like a summer day in Nuremberg. Chicago's market, started in 1995, was meant to resemble the original Christmas market held in the German city, with its red and white huts and craft-selling artisans. But don't go just for the European chocolates and lace table linens. Go for the 90-foot-tall Christmas tree adorned with thousands of lights and ornaments. Really. You know a bigger Christmas tree? Christkindlmarket runs Nov. 22-Dec. 24. The 94th annual tree lighting ceremony begins at 4:30 p.m. Nov. 23, with the lighting at 5 p.m. (this sentence as published has been corrected in this text).\nPrice: Entrance is free.\nThe Goodman Theatre's 'A Christmas Carol'\nBest for: Multigenerational, Romantic couples, Money's no object, First-timers, Sightseers\nFigure in: 2 1/2 hours for humbug, ghastly ghouls and yuletide cheer.\nGeography: 170 N.

{"text": "Military families are a key voting bloc in battleground Virginia, but one group fears its voice will be under-represented on Election Day.\nRequests for absentee ballots from members of the armed services, their spouses and dependents could be down sharply from 2008, according to statistics from the Military Voter Protection Project, which is seeking to boost voter participation among troops.\nThe blame for the anemic numbers rests with the Defense Department, which has been slow to enact reforms that make it easier to register, said Eric Eversole, founder and executive director of MVP.\n\"I see a significant amount of foot-dragging,\" Eversole said Tuesday.\nThe Pentagon takes \"strong issue\" with the MVP report, spokesman George Little said Tuesday, saying its figures are dated and doesn't take into account recent outreach efforts.\nAs of late August, 1,746 absentee ballot requests came from military families in Virginia, the group said. For all of 2008, the number was 20,738.\nEversole's group recently released an update that tracked a slightly different population: military members, their families and civilian overseas voters. There was still a shortfall. The current number of requests as of Sept. 22 from that group was nearly 13,000. That's a drop of 70 percent from 2008, when the number was 41,762.\nAlthough more requests are coming in every day, the gap between this year and 2008 is so wide in both groups that it raises serious concerns, Eversole said.\n\"The number of absentee ballots being requested is shockingly low,\" he said.\nThe group also released data that cited shortfalls compared to 2008 in Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and Illinois.\nA federal official countered Tuesday that government outreach efforts are better than ever, and warned against comparing figures from this political season with the 2008 race, because the two campaigns are different.\nPam Mitchell, acting director for the Federal Voter Assistance Program, said activity on the program's web site – which includes site visits and downloading of applications – is comparable to 2004. That was the last time an incumbent president faced off against a challenger. The 2008 race was different, she noted, because the nomination was wide open on both sides and therefore could have attracted more voter interest.\nLittle, the Pentagon spokesman, cited another reason why a 2012 and 2008 comparison isn't valid.\n\"They did a compare and contrast between this year and 2008,\" Little said. \"And it's important to remember that there -- the number of deployed service members, especially in the war zones, has declined significantly. So just as an example, the Virginia National Guard, as I understand it, has all units home for the first time in 10 years. We have ended the war in Iraq. We have drawn down in Afghanistan. And it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.\"\nAnother issue is whether the Defense Department has followed through on changes required by the 2009 Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act, or MOVE. One provision required a voter assistance office at every military installation – not necessarily a free-standing office, but a place where incoming soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines could register to vote, change address or receive other assistance when they first arrived on base.\nEversole said the department was slow to create the offices, and some offices were placed in out-of-the way locations.\nMitchell said the government is now \"fully compliant\" with the MOVE Act, with 221 voter assistance offices at bases in the U.S. and around the world.\nLangley Air Force Base in Hampton has a voter assistance office at the Bateman Library, said 1st Lt. John Cooper, a base spokesman who is also the installation's voting assistance officer. Airman can come to the office by appointment, and there is a dedicated email box for questions and concerns. Perhaps most importantly, voting assistance is available at briefings for incoming airmen, he said.\nInformation on voter assistance was not available from Fort Eustis in Newport News and Naval Station Norfolk.\nMeanwhile, Virginia officials have gotten into the act trying to promote military voter participation.\nBack on Sept. 15, state officials publicized National Military Voter Readiness Day, encouraging members of the armed forces to apply for absentee ballots well in advance of the deadline.\nIn Virginia, requests to vote absentee by mail must be received by the State Board of Elections by close of business on Oct. 30, said board spokeswoman Nikki Sheridan.\nThose in the armed services and others who live overseas are advised to mail their requests well before that day.\n\"I can't reiterate enough, the time is now,\" Sheridan said.\nVirginia voting deadlines\nOct. 15: Deadline to apply to register to vote\nOct. 30: Requests to vote absentee by mail must be received by close of business on this day.", "id": "<urn:uuid:06de4695-e05b-4d18-ab20-e676c74a6cd4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.dailypress.com/2012-10-02/news/dp-nws-military-absentee-voting-20121002_1_eric-eversole-military-voter-protection-project-absentee-ballots", "date": "2013-05-18T08:11:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9743682742118835, "token_count": 986, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "by Dan Barker\nDear Believer, — You asked me to consider Christianity as the answer for my life. I have done that. I consider it untrue, repugnant, and harmful.\nYou expect me to believe Jesus was born of a virgin impregnated by a ghost? Do you believe all the crazy tales of ancient religions? Julius Caesar was reportedly born of a virgin; Roman historian Seutonius said Augustus bodily rose to heaven when he died; and Buddha was supposedly born speaking. You don’t believe all that, do you? Why do you expect me to swallow the fables of Christianity?\nI find it incredible that you ask me to believe that the earth was created in six literal days; women come from a man’s rib; a snake, a donkey, and a burning bush spoke human language; the entire world was flooded, covering the mountains to drown evil; all animal species, millions of them, rode on one boat; language variations stem from the tower of Babel; Moses had a magic wand; the Nile turned to blood; a stick turned into a snake; witches, wizards, and sorcerers really exist; food rained from the sky for 40 years; people were cured by the sight of a brass serpent; the sun stood still to help Joshua win a battle, and it went backward for King Hezekiah; men survived unaided in a fiery furnace; a detached hand floated in the air and wrote on a wall; men followed a star which directed them to a particular house; Jesus walked on water unaided; fish and bread magically multiplied to feed the hungry; water instantly turned into wine; mental illness is caused by demons; a “devil” with wings exists who causes evil; people were healed by stepping into a pool agitated by angels; disembodied voiced spoke from the sky; Jesus vanished and later materialized from thin air; people were healed by Peter’s shadow; angels broke people out of jail; a fiery lake of eternal torment awaits unbelievers under the earth ... while there is life-after-death in a city which is 1,500 miles cubed, with mansions and food, for Christians only.\nIf you believe these stories, then you are the one with the problem, not me. These myths violate natural law, contradict science, and fail to correspond with reality or logic. If you can’t see that, then you can’t separate truth from fantasy. It doesn’t matter how many people accept delusions inflicted by “holy” men; a widely held lie is still a lie. If you are so gullible, then you are like the child who believes the older brother who says there is a monster in the hallway. But there is nothing to be afraid of; go turn on the light and look for yourself.\nIf Christianity were simply untrue I would not be too concerned. Santa is untrue, but it is a harmless myth which people outgrow. But Christianity, besides being false, is also abhorrent. It amazes me that you claim to love the god of the bible, a hateful, arrogant, sexist, cruel being who can’t tolerate criticism. I would not want to live in the same neighborhood with such a creature!\nThe biblical god is a macho male warrior. Though he said “Thou shalt not kill,” he ordered death for all opposition, wholesale drowning and mass exterminations; punishes offspring to the fourth generation (Ex. 20:5); ordered pregnant women and children to be ripped up (Hos. 13:16); demands animal and human blood to appease his angry vanity; is partial to one race of people; judges women to be inferior to men; is a sadist who created a hell to torture unbelievers; created evil (Is. 45:7); discriminated against the handicapped (Lev. 21:18-23); ordered virgins to be kept as spoils of war (Num. 31:15-18, Deut. 21:11-14); spread dung on people’s faces (Mal. 2:3); sent bears to devour 42 children who teased a prophet (II Kings 2:23-24); punishes people with snakes, dogs, dragons, drunkenness, swords, arrows, axes, fire, famine, and infanticide; and said fathers should eat their sons (Ez. 5:10). Is that nice? Would you want to live next door to such a person?\nAnd Jesus is a chip off the old block. He said, “I and my father are one,” and he upheld “every jot and tittle” of the Old Testament law. Mt. 5:18 He preached the same old judgment: vengeance and death, wrath and distress, hell and torture for all nonconformists. He believed in demons, angels and spirits. He never denounced the subjugation of slaves or women. Women were excluded as disciples and as guests at his heavenly table. Except for hell he introduced nothing new to ethics or philosophy. He was disrespectful of his mother and brothers; he said we should hate our parents and desert our families. Mt. 10:35-36, Lk. 14:26 (So much for “Christian family life.”) He denounced anger, but was often angry himself. Mt. 5:22, Mk. 3:5 He called people “fools” (Mt. 23:17,19), “serpents,” and “white sepulchers,” though he warned that such language puts you in danger of hellfire. Mt. 5:22 He said “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword.\" Mt. 10:34 (So much for “Peace on Earth.”) He irrationally cursed and withered a fig tree for being barren out of season. Mt. 21:19 He mandated burning unbelievers. Jn. 15:6 (The Church has complied with relish.) He stole a horse. Lk. 19:30-33 He told people to cut off hands, feet, eyes and sexual organs. Mt. 5:29-30, 19:12 You want me to accept Jesus, but I think I’ll pick my own friend, thank you.\nOne of Jesus’s many contradictions was saying good works should be seen, and not seen. Mt. 5:16, 6:1-4 One of his mistakes was saying that the mustard plant has the smallest seed. Mt. 13:31-32 The writers of Matthew and Luke could not even get his genealogy straight, contradicting the Old Testament, and giving Jesus two discrepant lines through Joseph, his non-father!\nI also find Christianity to be morally repugnant. The concepts of original sin, depravity, substitutionary forgiveness, intolerance, eternal punishment, and humble worship are all beneath the dignity of intelligent human beings and conflict with the values of kindness and reason. They are barbaric ideas for primitive cultures cowering in fear and ignorance.\nFinally, Christianity is harmful. More people have been killed in the name of a god than for any other reason. The Church has a shameful, bloody history of Crusades, Inquisitions, witch-burnings, heresy trials, American colonial intolerance, disrespect of indigenous traditions (such as American Indians), support of slavery, and oppression of women. Modern “fruits” of religion include the Jonestown massacre, the callous fraud of “faith healers,” recent wars and ethnic cleansing, and fighting in Northern Ireland. Religion also poses a danger to mental health, damaging self-respect, personal responsibility, and clarity of thought.\nDo you see why I do not respect the biblical message? It is an insulting bag of nonsense. You have every right to torment yourself with such insanity — but leave me out of it.

{"text": "TURTLE BAY, Hawaii — The surf rolls in with tumbling white crests over the sculptured coral on the far north coast of Oahu, capital island of Hawaii.\nKuilima Point, a finger of land reaching out into the Pacific Ocean, catches the surf and keeps a small private bay serene for quiet snorkeling. The warm sands along the beach invite sunbathing.\nOut on the point, 400 guest rooms and suites in three low-rise wings overlook the challenging surf.\nGuest cottages are nested in tropical greenery above the surf, with a tennis club in its own greenery behind the cottages. Surrounding the resort is the 18-hole Arnold Palmer golf course.\nHonolulu and Waikiki are an hour's drive away, across north Oahu's fields of sugar cane.\nIn 1972, Oahu's only North Shore resort opened as the Del Webb Kuilima Hotel on Turtle Bay, encompassing 808 acres of ocean-front land near the town of Kahuku.\nIn 1984, after a $17-million renovation, the resort reopened as the Turtle Bay Hilton & Country Club.\nNew Hotels Planned\nAsahi Jyuken, an investment and development company based in Osaka, Japan, paid about $127.5 million to buy the resort from Prudential Insurance Co., which has been the owner since the Del Webb era of the 1970s and early 1980s. Hilton Hotels will continue to operate the resort.\nThe Japanese firm intends to build another hotel on adjacent Kawela Bay, a project that had received all necessary permits before the sale. Two more hotels, another 18-hole golf course and a second equestrian center also are planned, along with 2,000 condominium units.\nWill Turtle Bay continue to seem area codes away from Honolulu and Waikiki?\nThe same kind of question was being asked by local people and environmentalists when we first came here 16 years ago, when the Kuilima Hotel was less than a month away from its grand opening.\nLater we heard that Del Webb had reached out from Las Vegas to north Oahu with the belief and hope that casino gambling would soon be legalized in Hawaii.\nIt never happened. Kuilima is no longer a destination name. The postal address is still Kahuku, but the resort area has come to be known as Turtle Bay, which is the wide bay open to the sea, not the private bay protected by the point.\nAs we arrived from Waikiki, surfers were out waiting for the big waves. Some of the best surf in the world is found at the \"Pipeline,\" just beyond Kawela Bay and off Sunset Beach.\nThe golf course is home of the Arnold Palmer Golf School and is managed by the Arnold Palmer Golf Management Co. The Arnold Palmer/Sam Snead \"Legends of Golf\" tournament is held here in January; top women pros compete in February.\nFor guests there are complimentary golf clinics Tuesday and Thursday mornings. Greens fees with carts are $45 for guests. The Turtle Bay Twosome golf package is $95 per person per night, double occupancy; it includes ocean-view accommodations and a round of golf.\nThe Peter Burwash professional tennis organization manages the tennis club and has complimentary clinics for guests three mornings a week. The Tennis Holiday package is $77.50 per person per night, double occupancy, for accommodations, court time and a private lesson.\nOther sports on the North Coast include horseback riding, windsurfing and scuba diving. Quilting, lei-making and leaf weaving are quieter options.\nDining is in the Cove restaurant and out on the Palm Terrace, with Sunday champagne brunch in the Sea Tide Room.

{"text": "Those multicultural slackers, hipper and less corn-fed than the groups gamboling across the pages of Vogue or the spiffily dressed junior execs who star in ads targeted for Forbes or GQ, will be seen in Vibe, Wired, Details and Rolling Stone. Bus shelters in a number of cities are papered with an unstudly, shirtless guy in Tommy jeans, the FIGER on his underwear waistband peeping out above his slender hip. The irresistible kindergarten-recess portrait used for Tommy Hilfiger boys ads features diverse children dressed in rolled-up khakis and polos bearing the Hilfiger lion crest. They look like they could teach world leaders how to play in the sandbox harmoniously.\nImage maintenance is just one crucial element of the strategy that helped make Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A. the No. 1 apparel firm traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Barbara Bates, president of the company, worked at Polo for 10 years before joining Hilfiger in 1991. \"Obviously, the product had to be great,\" she says. \"But the presentation, the visual merchandising, having our own shops within the department stores, having our own selling specialists, was all important. That was a formula that had worked very well at Polo. Creating the hype behind it was a formula that had worked very successfully also, so we very aggressively went after that, first in men's, then in boys, we're doing it in denim right now, and we're launching women's wear the same way.\"\nRalph Lauren, who has just inaugurated two younger, lower-priced lines to combat Hilfiger's encroachment, was an unwitting tutor. \"Ralph and I have very similar taste,\" Hilfiger says. \"We both love the classics. I think Ralph has done an incredible job, and if anybody has been an influence in America, he has.\"\nIn the 14-person Hilfiger design studio, the major collections and mini-groups that roll out every month are developed. Each is designed around a theme, a location or an activity in which form follows function. The themes impart a look and a palette and conjure visions of a fantasy lifestyle: Expedition, Alpine, Nautical, Tailgate, Bermuda, Back Bay. Lauren began working with themes in the '70s: Sun Valley, Santa Fe, Safari. A genealogical chart of traditional American style would trace a line from Brooks Brothers to Lauren to Hilfiger.\n\"I take the classic idea and mix it with a lot of different inspirations,\" Hilfiger says. \"I made my shirts oversized and I made them relaxed. I washed the cotton shirts till they were soft. I made my chinos baggy and loose. Now I'm looking at board sports and getting inspiration from what the snowboarders and surfers wear.\"\n\"Five minutes to first outfit.

{"text": "The vaunted protection that intellectually active adults get from Alzheimer’s disease has a dark downside, a study released Wednesday has found. Once dementia symptoms become evident and Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed in such patients, their mental decline can come with frightening speed.\nThat finding, published in the journal Neurology, comes from a study of 1,157 Chicago-based seniors who were followed for an average of just over 11 years. Six years after gauging the extent to which the study participants engaged in activities that challenged their mental capacities, researchers from Rush University Medical Center Alzheimer’s Disease Center made periodic assessments of the study participants’ cognitive health and traced the trajectories of their brain health.\nAll told, 148 of the participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease during the follow-up period, and 395 were found to have mild cognitive impairment—intellectual problems that are less severe than Alzheimer’s disease, but which often precede such a diagnosis.\nWhile all participants’ mental function showed yearly declines, the steepest downward trajectories belonged to those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, but who had reported high levels of mental engagement at the outset of the study. Fellow Alzheimer’s sufferers who had not sought out much intellectual stimulation at the study’s outset showed a more gradual decline in their function.\n“In effect, the results of this study suggest that the benefit of delaying the initial appearance of cognitive impairment [in Alzheimer’s disease] comes at the cost of more rapid dementia progression,” the author wrote.\nThe findings support a common observation of those who treat intellectually minded patients who go on to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease—that once diagnosed, their decline is rapid. It also underscores a growing body of evidence that the bright and mentally-active may not beat Alzheimer’s disease, but can hold off its ravages for months or years longer than those who are not so engaged.\nDr. John M. Ringman, a UCLA neurologist and assistant director of the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research, said he sees regular evidence of the phenomenonen in his clinical work, as well as in brain-imaging scans that can detect the physical signs of Alzheimer’s disease while a patient is still alive: Patients with a history of intensive mental engagement seem to develop a “cognitive reserve,” said Dr. Ringman. That mental strength frequently allows them to function almost normally, he said, even as the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallmarks of the disease have advanced upon the brain.\nBy the time such a patient comes to his office complaining that his memory and mental function are not what they used to be, the disease has progressed significantly, said Ringman. The decline from that point can be precipitous.\nIn a disease that evidence now suggests takes years, perhaps decades, to show up in everyday behavior, Ringman said “it’s hard to quantify this cognitive reserve.” The strength of the study published Wednesday is that it gathered copious evidence of participants’ mental status and activity at the outset and followed them for more than a decade, he added.\n--Melissa Healy/Los Angeles Times", "id": "<urn:uuid:5d156165-181a-4195-a926-d51850c7b599>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/01/news/la-heb-alzheimers-20100901", "date": "2013-05-18T06:22:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9584160447120667, "token_count": 679, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Belgian physicist Francois Englert, left, speaks with British physicist… (Fabrice Coffrini / AFP/Getty…)\nFor physicists, it was a moment like landing on the moon or the discovery of DNA.\nThe focus was the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that exists for a mere fraction of a second. Long theorized but never glimpsed, the so-called God particle is thought to be key to understanding the existence of all mass in the universe. The revelation Wednesday that it -- or some version of it -- had almost certainly been detected amid more than hundreds of trillions of high-speed collisions in a 17-mile track near Geneva prompted a group of normally reserved scientists to erupt with joy.\nFor The Record\nLos Angeles Times Friday, July 06, 2012 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 48 words Type of Material: Correction\nLarge Hadron Collider: In some copies of the July 5 edition, an article in Section A about the machine used by physicists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research to search for the Higgs boson referred to the $5-billion Large Hadron Collider. The correct amount is $10 billion.\nPeter Higgs, one of the scientists who first hypothesized the existence of the particle, reportedly shed tears as the data were presented in a jampacked and applause-heavy seminar at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\"It's a gigantic triumph for physics,\" said Frank Wilczek, an MIT physicist and Nobel laureate. \"It's a tremendous demonstration of a community dedicated to understanding nature.\"\nThe achievement, nearly 50 years in the making, confirms physicists' understanding of how mass -- the stuff that makes stars, planets and even people -- arose in the universe, they said.\nIt also points the way toward a new path of scientific inquiry into the mass-generating mechanism that was never before possible, said UCLA physicist Robert Cousins, a member of one of the two research teams that has been chasing the Higgs boson at CERN.\n\"I compare it to turning the corner and walking around a building -- there's a whole new set of things you can look at,\" he said. \"It is a beginning, not an end.\"\nLeaders of the two teams reported independent results that suggested the existence of a previously unseen subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 to 126 billion electron volts. Both groups got results at a \"five sigma\" level of confidence -- the statistical requirement for declaring a scientific \"discovery.\"\n\"The chance that either of the two experiments had seen a fluke is less than three parts in 10 million,\" said UC San Diego physicist Vivek Sharma, a former leader of one of the Higgs research groups. \"There is no doubt that we have found something.\"\nBut he and others stopped just shy of saying that this new particle was indeed the long-sought Higgs boson. \"All we can tell right now is that it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck,\" Sharma said.\nIn this case, quacking was enough for most.\n\"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably at least a bird,\" said Wilczek, who stayed up past 3 a.m. to watch the seminar live over the Web while vacationing in New Hampshire.\nCertainly CERN leaders in Geneva, even as they referred to their discovery simply as \"a new particle,\" didn't bother hiding their excitement.\nThe original plan had been to present the latest results on the Higgs search at the International Conference on High Energy Physics, a big scientific meeting that began Wednesday in Melbourne.\nBut as it dawned on CERN scientists that they were on the verge of \"a big announcement,\" Cousins said, officials decided to honor tradition and instead present the results on CERN's turf.\nThe small number of scientists who theorized the existence of the Higgs boson in the 1960s -- including Higgs of the University of Edinburgh -- were invited to fly to Geneva.\nFor the non-VIP set, lines to get into the auditorium began forming late Tuesday. Many spent the night in sleeping bags.\nAll the hubbub was due to the fact that the discovery of the Higgs boson is the last piece of the puzzle needed to complete the so-called Standard Model of particle physics -- the big picture that describes the subatomic particles that make up everything in the universe, and the forces that work between them.\nOver the course of the 20th century, as physicists learned more about the Standard Model, they struggled to answer one very basic question: Why does matter exist?\nHiggs and others came up with a possible explanation: that particles gain mass by traveling through an energy field. One way to think about it is that the field sticks to the particles, slowing them down and imparting mass.\nThat energy field came to be known as the Higgs field. The particle associated with the field was dubbed the Higgs boson.\nHiggs published his theory in 1964. In the 48 years since, physicists have eagerly chased the Higgs boson. Finding it would provide the experimental confirmation they needed to show that their current understanding of the Standard Model was correct.\nOn the other hand, ruling it out would mean a return to the drawing board to look for an alternative Higgs particle, or several alternative Higgs particles, or perhaps to rethink the Standard Model from the bottom up.\nEither outcome would be monumental, scientists said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:fb237ffb-9cc0-4077-99d5-56c6fce1ca5f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/05/science/la-sci-higgs-boson-new-particle-20120705", "date": "2013-05-18T08:11:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9634510278701782, "token_count": 1134, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Where to put special education students in Lehighton Area School District buildings has been a longstanding problem for district officials.\nAs with most districts throughout the area, Lehighton has an increasing number of special education students and not enough space to put them.\nAlthough the School Board ended one space problem with a move made at this week's meeting, members learned that another problem has arisen.\nAccording to acting Superintendent Robert Nagle, the district must provide three classrooms as part of a fair share program with the Carbon-Lehigh Intermediate Unit.\nThe fair share program allows Lehighton to send its special education students to another district for instruction. As part of the agreement, however, Lehighton must return the favor sometime.\nNagle said a current special education classroom at the Franklin Elementary School has been found to be substandard because it can only hold six students instead of 15.\nOne room in the high school is substandard and a resource room in the East Penn Elementary School is moved around as rooms become available, Nagle said.\nIn addition, Nagle said, the district must find two classrooms for Lehighton students presently attending classes in the Palmerton Area School District. Palmerton has informed the intermediate unit that it will need the classrooms next school term for its own students.\n\"What we're finding in the Lehighton School District is that we simply don't have the room,\" Nagle said.\nRobert J. Klucharich, director of curriculum and instruction in the Lehighton district, briefed the board on several ways of creating more classroom space.\nKlucharich said a former school building in the Packerton section of Mahoning Township could be used to house the district's administrative offices. Klucharich said the move would open up space in the Shull-David Elementary School, the present location of the administrative offices.\nPortable facilities could also be used to increase available space for classrooms, Klucharich said.\nA long-term solution to the problem, according to Klucharich, would be to integrate or mainstream special education students into regular classrooms.\nThe School Board took no action on Klucharich's suggestions, but did authorize district officials to continue a study on how to solve the problem and to make a recommendation at a future meeting.\nThe board did, however, improve the junior high special education situation by agreeing to allow nine seventh-grade students to be inte grated into regular classrooms on a full-time basis.\nJames Smith, the junior high school principal, called the move a \"compassionate alternative to isolation.\"\nThe nine students, composing an entire class, are termed self-contained, and have some degree of learning disability or are classified as mildly emotionally or mentally retarded.\nUnder the plan, the students will attend all classes with regular education students. Intermediate unit personnel and junior high teachers will meet to discuss an educational program for the students.\nEach student will receive a grade from the intermediate unit teacher, who will continue to teach English and reading to the nine students.\nSmith has said the move will have no effect on classes attended by regular students, and will help improve the self-esteem of the special education students.\n\"Children will no longer be isolated from other students and all students will have a chance to participate in experiments, view quality educational media, and socialize with all of the other students in the junior high,\" Smith said.\nThe special education students had previously been integrated or mainstreamed into classes such as art, shop and physical education. The students will now be taking course such as science, social studies, math, geography and skills for adolescence while sitting next to regular education students.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8c42f89f-3538-49cd-9283-6b4d7d994a9a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.mcall.com/1989-03-01/news/2675029_1_special-education-students-regular-classrooms-district-s-administrative-offices", "date": "2013-05-18T06:57:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.965471088886261, "token_count": 747, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Spearing for pike and musky was slow and no reports on walleye.\nBlack Lake: Was producing some nice perch but catch rates were slow. A few muskie were caught.\nGrand Lake: Is producing some perch and panfish. For pike and walleye, try tip-ups in Whiskey Bay or Black Bass Bay.\nVan Etten Lake: Ice anglers were catching a few perch.\nHiggins Lake: Smelt have been caught in the evening along the west side of the lake between Big Creek and the North State Park. The fish are suspended in 30 to 40 feet of water. Lake trout and whitefish are still in the North Bay in 80 to 100 feet of water. Try gray shiners for lake trout or wax worms and wigglers for whitefish. Those pike spearing off Sam-O-Set Park have taken fish in 15 to 18 feet of water. Perch were also caught in the same area in 20 to 40 feet of water however anglers will need to sort out the small ones. Perch can still be found off Point Detroit and Flag Point.\nHoughton Lake: Nothing on panfish yet however with the warm up, bluegill and crappie should start biting. For walleye, fish the west side of the lake.\nTawas: Fishing was slow but perch anglers were still targeting waters 15 to 20 feet deep and 20 feet for walleye. Pike spearing was slow because of muddy water.\nAu Gres: Produced a few walleye straight out in 32 feet of water and off Booth Road in 26 to 30 feet of water. Rumor has it pike spearing has picked up and so has the success rate south of the breakwall and in the bayous.", "id": "<urn:uuid:d9fd20f9-00e7-4686-8b97-2774d140f15e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.petoskeynews.com/2011-01-26/perch-fishing_27051185", "date": "2013-05-18T05:30:15Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9780257940292358, "token_count": 1013, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Actually, Caputo is referring to the male heart, because he is a very male author whose idea of a good time is to hook a marlin in the waters near his home in Key West, Fla., to fight that fish to the finish and thus experience, as he once put it, \"the pleasant pain (and) the cleansing exhaustion that come after a hard-fought battle.\" No, Caputo will never be mistaken for Alan Alda, not with his boxer's build and the slight limp in his gait, the latter courtesy of wounds suffered in Beirut 12 years ago when a sniper felled him with rounds from a Soviet rifle.\nTen years ago this spring, Caputo published a memoir, A Rumor of War, which became the first Vietnam best seller at a time when the war was a taboo topic and vets were often treated as lepers. Today, ironically, with war books flooding the market and Platoon topping the box-office charts, Caputo vows that his fourth work (and third novel), the newly released Indian Country, is his last substantive word on what happened.\nHis fans might be disappointed to learn this - Caputo is our most prominent macho man of letters, the heir to Hemingway and Conrad - but now, for the first time, he appears to have found a little peace of mind. He has actually written a happy ending; the main character, a Vietnam vet, transcends his mental prison and finds the road to redemption.\nThis is no small literary event; as Caputo puts it, \"the other books ended as horrifying downers, with no redemption in any way.\" Now 46 and twice divorced, Caputo was known as a guy who would stomp around his house, acting out (and living within) his profane, half-mad characters - men who were often eager to embrace the beasts within them because it felt good to flout the rules.\n\"I pretty much felt the need to get out of that (dark) outlook myself,\" said Caputo, during a visit last week to Bantam, his publisher. \"Maybe I needed to come to terms with something. With that constant drumbeat of despair, you start to wonder, 'Well, if there isn't much hope, and it's all kind of bleak, why don't I just kill myself?' And then you begin to see reasons why you shouldn't. You begin to see what is life-affirming.\"\nFortuitously, Caputo's tale of spiritual renewal arrives at a time when, in his words, \"there's a real subliminal hunger on the part of the American public to make some sense out of what happened (in the war) - to come to terms with it. But coming to terms means recognizing that we're just as capable of committing the kinds of moral evil as the great European colonial powers did in the past, and that we've got to transcend ourselves.\"\nBut he wonders whether Americans are learning this lesson. Right now, he says, there is too much evidence to the contrary. All he has to do is read the papers.\n\"I came out of the war with the perception that people, including myself, were capable of things that I didn't think one could be capable of doing,\" Caputo says. \"I felt certain impulses that were kind of scary. It led me to a perception that human nature was not as fundamentally sound and good as I'd thought previously. I realized that our hold on goodness was rather tenuous, that it was contingent upon the existence of some form of civilization, without which we'd tend to run amok.\"\nLooking back to his youth, he says, the irony is that \"I had a desire to escape civilization, and that's why I went (to Vietnam) - to escape its suffocating restraints. I had kind of an American frontier outlook - to go out into the wilds, because that's where man would really flourish. But that ideal of mine was just turned on its head by Vietnam.\"\nA product of a middle-class Italian family from the Chicago suburbs, Caputo reached manhood during Camelot, when the Kennedy goal was to pay any price and bear any burden. So the lover of romantic poets, the student of theology and metaphysics, the Catholic with the seemingly strong moral compass, became a gung-ho Marine.\nHe was one of the first to land in Vietnam in 1965, and before long \"a callus began to grow around our hearts.\" He became a platoon leader, \"an agent of death.\" His mission was to kill Viet Cong in quantity, to \"stack 'em like cordwood,\" because war was \"a matter of arithmetic.\"\nIn battle he felt elation as well as dread. He commanded a platoon that rampaged through villages, an \"incendiary mob\" that, at one point, murdered two innocent civilians. He was later put on trial for these murders, but a plea bargain was reached and he was reprimanded for minor offenses.\nHe was honorably discharged in 1967, wandered around Spain trying to put his war stories on paper, returned to Chicago, worked as an advertising copywriter, and then joined a suburban newspaper. He missed the \"sheer intensity\" of the war, although by this time he opposed it politically. He thought the United States should get out, although, in his civilian life, ''everything felt kind of bland and dull.\"\nThen the Chicago Tribune hired him, and, after he shared a Pulitzer Prize for a team probe of city voting fraud, the paper sent him overseas - to Rome, then to Beirut, where he was captured by Palestinian guerrillas, then to Saigon for the American debacle in 1975, and again to Beirut, where he was wounded. By this time, his proposal for a Vietnam memoir was making the rounds in New York; while confined to a wheelchair, he learned that he had a publisher.\nA Rumor of War appeared in 1977, when it was trendy for publishers to say that readers didn't care about a lost war. But Caputo's grunts-in-the-paddy perspective won an audience, and books and movies on the war became chic. Caputo quit the Tribune, moved to Key West and began writing novels. Horn of Africa took place in Ethiopia, but its themes were grounded in the war. DelCorso's Gallery featured a photographer obsessed with the horrors of\nVietnam and Beirut.\nHe has been able to live well by writing about death, but there are times when he is not sure the public is getting the right message. Take the Oscar- winning film Platoon, for example. \"The movie has been ballyhooed as an introduction to what 'really' happened, as Vietnam Experience 101,\" he says. ''But it sets up a false metaphor by dividing this platoon into the forces of darkness and the forces of light. Barnes, the bad sergeant, battles archangel Sgt. Elias. Each has his followers, bad versus good. And that's just bull. It didn't happen that way, and it should offend the intelligence of the public.\"\n\"Here was Barnes, with no single redeeming virtue, and he drank whiskey. The 'bad' guys all drank, and the 'good' guys all smoked pot. That was so stupid, just idiotic. The movie is simplistic. It doesn't confront people with the very difficult truth that good and evil exist within a single human breast, that good or evil can be made manifest depending on the circumstances.\"\nHe pauses, thinking back to his war stint. \"You could get a guy who might often be a perfectly ordinary man and suddenly, under extraordinary circumstances, he becomes a terrific hero or he performs a magnanimous act,\" he says. \"Conversely, the same guy could do something brutal and evil within that same moral and geographical wilderness.\"\nCaputo shrugs. \"But hey,\" he says, \"Oliver Stone is a filmmaker. . . . That's why the public needs literature more than ever. It's the function of literature to explore these complexities. Unfortunately, the country seems to be getting more subliterate.\"\nCaputo denies that he writes about war because he wants to relive it or to\nsomehow purge himself. \"I lived for that intensity,\" he acknowledges, \"for the camaraderie, the sheer intensity of the experience, and I do think there still is some residue of that, some impulse toward the extraordinary. But now I'm getting a little too old for that. You'd have to have a shrink interview me, to say whether there's been some therapy involved. But I don't think so. I think of myself as a professional, and that takes mental discipline.\"\nCaputo is big on personal tests. His hitch in Vietnam taught him to distrust opinionated people whose views have not been challenged, people who think and act without having searched their conscience. To Caputo, both the Iran-contra scandal and the Ivan Boesky flap on Wall Street stem from \"a cowboy mentality very much in the American character, very much rooted in the desire to escape rules and regulations, to do whatever the hell you want. People get a particular end in mind that they think is so overwhelmingly necessary that they do almost anything to further it.\"\nThe arming of the contras, he says, is symptomatic of the fact that \"we still have this image of ourselves as an idealistic and visionary people, and it's not easy for us to accept the dark side of our character. As the Soviet Union is now, can be just as true of us, because we're just as capable of doing (harm) as any other nation in the past.\"\nBut Vietnam, he says, was more than just a foreign war; it was an indictment of certain American values that Caputo deplores - the quest for success at all costs, the reliance on \"technocratic rationalism that becomes irrational.\" In Indian Country, Vietnam vet Chris Starkmann serves as a metaphor for a nation in the throes of a spiritual crisis. We are a nation of lonely people, Caputo says, isolated from one another by selfishness, by a desire to flout the rules that should bind us together.\nHe sees a need in this nation for spiritual (as opposed to religious) renewal, much like the one Chris Starkmann finally achieves - \"a return,\" he says, \"to a form of piety, a recognition that we are all creatures of God, creatures of a higher power, and we owe something to each other and to our human race. Because when we liberate ourselves from what makes us human, we become monsters.\n\"I saw a lot of that with the guys in Vietnam - a recognition that if one can commit certain acts that are utterly reprehensible, it can give you a hideous but very attractive freedom, and suddenly you can snip all the bonds to what you once were. There is this inner voice, though, that can always tell you when something is morally evil. The voice was there for me, but I just failed to listen to it. The lust for blood can become so powerful that even though something is telling you 'this is a monstrosity,' it doesn't matter.\n\"You just have to learn to listen to that inner voice.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:c9afa4d1-ce97-41eb-8d54-02810d022af5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.philly.com/1987-05-20/news/26162254_1_hemingway-and-conrad-indian-country-philip-caputo", "date": "2013-05-18T06:00:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.984187662601471, "token_count": 2308, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "In the basement studio of Crumb's home in Media (where he barricades himself away from the six household dogs), you can pick up a cylinder resembling a sawed-off mailing tube, pull the string hanging out of the bottom, and hear the sound of a cavernous exhalation. It's typical of Crumb's otherworldly ominousness, heard most famously in his settings of Garcia Lorca poems, titled Ancient Voices of Children.\nAs with his six previous songbooks, the new one builds phantasmagorical sound environments around hymns, spirituals, and folk songs, many of which he heard during his upbringing in Charleston, W.Va. His daughter, Ann Crumb, is again a featured soloist, along with baritone Patrick Mason. Though the huge battery of percussion is used with spare precision - there are only four players - the voices have to be amplified, especially in passages inspired by the flocks of crows in the composer's backyard.\nCrumb flips through the score: \"Here I use a low-pitch siren. It's in a very soft range, like a disembodied human voice. Here's the African-Brazilian berimbau,\" a stringed instrument that makes a buzzing sound. \"I knew about it long ago. A percussionist found the crazy thing and I thought of a way to use it. . . . \"\nThough Philadelphia has surprisingly extensive percussion rental agencies, baritone Mason is bringing American Indian rattles in from Boulder, Colo., where he lives. One new feature of Voices From the Heartland is the presence of Navajo and Pawnee chants, the words of which are similar in tone to the Chinese poems Gustav Mahler used in his Das Lied von der Erde.\nHow Crumb came to do this is hard to say: His process is too intuitive for self-analysis. \"I hardly know any facts about the construction of my music,\" he says. \"I'm sure there is some rational process involved. . . . \"\nCertainly, he's remarkably easygoing about how his music is reincarnated. At last year's Ojai Festival in California, director Peter Sellars staged one of Crumb's songbooks, a collection of Civil War songs titled The Winds of Destiny, with soprano Dawn Upshaw costumed as a traumatized Afghan-war veteran.\nHasn't he ever been curious to analyze what's really going on in his music? Though he was on the University of Pennsylvania faculty for more than three decades - analyzing scores by students such as Osvaldo Golijov and Jennifer Higdon - Crumb won't consider subjecting his own music to that kind of scrutiny.\n\"That's a form of suicide. If you get too analytical about your music, it becomes more like a textbook illustration. . . . something that looks good on a blackboard,\" he said, citing Paul Hindemith as an example.\nCrumb does take a certain delight in how his music looks on the page. He loves inventing new time signatures that look like hieroglyphics. In years past, his manuscripts have sometimes come in different colors of ink. An eccentricity? An aesthetic priority? Whatever the case, Crumb has turned out to be a durable survivor of the American avant-garde, perhaps because he was never really a part of it.\nSuch now-deceased contemporaries as Milton Babbitt spent the 1960s producing ever more tightly controlled music with scores that looked more like complicated blueprints. John Cage went to the extreme opposite by declaring that even silence was music. Crumb crafted a sound world of his own with what are often called \"extended techniques\" - drawing unusual sounds out of conventional instruments and then moving on to unconventional instruments.\nThe impracticalities of such pieces only temporarily deterred their performance. His string quartet Black Angels, in which players shout and play tuned water glasses, inspired the formation of the Kronos Quartet - one sign of the lasting recognition that composers often don't have until after they're dead.\nYet for a decade or so, Crumb's compositional life seemed not to survive his fame. Throughout much of the 1990s, he was silent. The rumor in new-music circles was that he had had to give up his multi-pack-a-day smoking habit, and that that had somehow derailed his intuitive gifts. Typically, Crumb won't say anything definite on the subject. But he does quote Alban Berg, who supposed asked a prospective student, \"How can you compose if you don't smoke?\"\nUltimately, nothing truly excited him until his daughter, Ann - who has starred in several Broadway shows and will head the cast of Media Theatre's production of Wings - suggested he write a piece based on folk songs. The silence was broken in 2002 with the first of his songbooks, Unto the Hills, which had her singing \"I am a poor wayfaring stranger\" amid percussive explosions that suggested the song's protagonist was navigating land mines.\nCrumb routinely claims the latest songbook is his last, but often he has a few outtakes from the \"last\" piece, and they grow into the next one. Any future pieces, he says this time, will involve returning to Lorca.\nWhen that happens, Orchestra 2001 is likely to be the first to know - since Swarthmore-based founder/music director James Freeman has been a close collaborator with Crumb (along with Bridge Records, which records the new pieces soon after the premieres). Though Crumb's orchestral works have been performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, Freeman assures the composer that he need not settle for secondhand sounds.\n\"And it's so handy,\" the composer muses. \"Only five miles down the road!\"\nOrchestra 2001 performs\nat 8 p.m. Saturday at Trinity Center in Philadelphia and at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Lang Concert Hall, Swarthmore College. www.orchestra2001.org or 215-893-1999.\nContact music critic David Patrick Stearns at firstname.lastname@example.org.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5e6f8a63-3d32-49d8-bc4b-65eed2e0f23b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.philly.com/2012-01-24/news/30659551_1_george-crumb-ancient-voices-percussion", "date": "2013-05-18T05:32:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.975483238697052, "token_count": 1264, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "SOUTH BEND -- Is there such a thing as too much Darius? The durable sophomore running back on Saturday became the first Notre Dame football player since Phil Carter in 1980 to rush for 100 yards or more in each of the first three games of a season. Darius Walker had a career-high 116 yards on 26 carries in his most recent outing, a 44-41 overtime loss to Michigan State Saturday. He also had five catches for 24 yards and a TD in that game. \"I think Darius could run the ball in a game 40 times if you wanted him to, but you have to worry about the whole season,\" said ND head coach Charlie Weis, whose 16th-ranked Irish (2-1) visit Washington (1-2) Saturday. \"I wouldn't be very smart if I gave him the ball too many times in any game, because I want the kid to last the whole season. \"I've seen too many good running backs get worn out early in the year and have no gas in their tank at the end of the year.

{"text": "Rookie Steve David has been exciting powerboat fans since June 5, when he drove Pocket Savers Plus to fourth place in the Budweiser Unlimited Hydroplane Regatta at Miami Marine Stadium.\nThree months and six races later, David is no less impressive, though he has no victories.\nFrom Miami to Madison, Ind., and from Syracuse to Seattle, he has shown he intends to be among the sport`s superstars someday. He says he is pacing himself, and his ultimate goal is to vie for Driver of the Year.\nDavid`s first-year goals are less lofty. He wants to qualify, compete in the finals and finish in the money in every race. He has been successful five of seven times.\nStardom, as he obtained during 10 years of racing smaller limited hydroplanes, can wait.\nThe two times David failed to reach the finals were not his fault. He was clipped from behind in one race, and Pocket Savers Plus blew a piston in another.\n``Steve has an upbeat personality. He also has the talent it takes to do well,`` said Don Jones, American Power Boat Association hydroplane vice president and commissioner of the Seattle-based Unlimited Racing Commission.\nJones said if the vote were today, David would be a cinch to win Rookie of the Year. And David, 34, a real estate agent from Pompano Beach, would love nothing more.\nRookie of the Year status won`t be official until David competes in the final two unlimited races at San Diego and Las Vegas. But he already has a comfortable lead over the sport`s other two rookies: Larry Lauterbach of Portsmouth, Va., and Wheeler Baker of Chester, Md.\nThrough the Budweiser Cup in Seattle, David was in sixth out of 19 places in the American Hydroplane Series URC standings with 3,330 points. David leads Lauterbach by 684 points. Baker has yet to score a point.\nIn the last two races, David will have to race aboard a different boat than the one he has used all season. The original Pocket Savers Plus sustained damage to 70 percent of its hull when the warehouse it was stored in at Owensboro, Ky., caught fire three weeks ago.\n``The funny thing about it is that we`re leasing another boat to finish out the season and it`s faster than the one we`ve been using, so we should do even better,`` David said.\nThe newer boat, leased by the Fred Leland racing team from Seattle, has two Rolls Royce engines.\nDavid`s top finishes were fourth overall in Miami and fourth at the APBA Gold Cup in Evansville, Ind., June 26.\nIn Miami, David reached the finals by default when favorites and top qualifiers Jim Kropfeld in Miss Budweiser and Scott Pierce in Mr. Pringles withdrew because of an accident.\nPierce has since resumed racing. Kropfeld sustained neck and back injuries serious enough to keep him sidelined until next summer.\nDavid paid his dues to get to the unlimited circuit. He started racing 1- and 7-liter limited hydroplanes at 24.\n``I don`t consider limited racing the minor leagues,`` David said. ``Limiteds are just a different class of boat. You need a lot of the same skills. In a lot of places they get just as much respect as the unlimiteds.``\nDavid`s record in limited races enticed owners Jim McCormick and Bob Fendler to choose him as driver for Pocket Savers Plus.\nDavid still races limited boats. On July 10, he won the 1-Liter Stock Hydroplane World Championships. Last August he placed second in the APBA 7- Liter National Championships in Miami.\n``Of course moving up to the unlimited circuit is something every driver dreams about, but I still get a kick out of driving the smaller boats,`` David said. ``There`s only a few unlimited drivers out there, so I`m happy to be among them.``\nPocket Savers Plus is seventh of 18 unlimiteds. Miss Budweiser (6,721), which Tom D`Eath drove to victory during the last three series races, is top boat, followed by Mr. Pringles (6,169).\nDavid will race this weekend in San Diego at the Miller High Life Thunderboat Regatta. The final race is the Las Vegas Silver Cup Sept. 22-24.\n``We`re doing better than we expected,`` David said. ``It`s been a fun summer.``\n-- The Marine Fisheries Commission will hold two workshops in South Florida this week to receive public testimony on a proposal to set the maximum number of tarpon tags to be issued for 1989 at 10,000, with 5,000 reserved for licensed professional guides.

{"text": "Discrimination against citizens because of their sexual orientation or their youth is just as unfair as discrimination based on race, religion or gender. Access to housing, hotels, theaters and restaurants should be equal to all, as a matter of plain fairness.\nThe Palm Beach County Commission recognized this truth in passing an ordinance protecting homosexuals, unmarried couples and young people from discrimination in renting or buying housing and in public accommodations. The ordinance also bans discrimination based on race, religion, gender, ethnic origin or disability, but it was the protection of gays that generated opposition and demands for a countywide referendum on the issue.\nNo other Florida county protects homosexuals against housing discrimination. In the 1970s, Dade County passed a similar ordinance but it was repealed in a voter referendum after a bitter fight.\nA Broward County effort to revise the human rights law to protect homosexuals is more complicated. The Broward law was adopted through the Florida Legislature, so a revision must get legislative approval and be ratified in a public referendum.\nPalm Beach County`s ordinance passed 4-1; commissioner Ron Howard dissented. The other four commissioners demonstrated courage by refusing to buckle under to opponents or to pass the buck to the public in a referendum. Commissioners were elected to make tough decisions; this time they did.\nThe ordinance provides exceptions: A landlord who lives on his property of four or fewer housing units and rents the rest won`t have to comply. Nor will a seasonal resident who rents his home to someone else part of the year and lives in it himself the rest of the time. Also exempt are religious organizations that own housing units.\nThose sensible exceptions leave the vast majority of housing covered under the new ordinance. Violators will face fines of up to $50,000, but it may be difficult to prove a violation. Early decisive action against violators by law enforcers, prosecutors and judges could make a clear statement that the county means business and won`t tolerate further discrimination in housing and public accommodations.", "id": "<urn:uuid:04a92c65-e194-4b3c-ae6e-d4a7b6b1631d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-01-19/news/9001190945_1_ordinance-public-accommodations-housing", "date": "2013-05-18T08:13:40Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9598913788795471, "token_count": 402, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Nikhil Agarwal uses his mobile phone to search Google maps more than to make calls. The 29-year-old marketing professional has to travel extensively in the course of his job and needs to find his way around strange cities and unknown towns. For Nikhil, the map in his palm is a blessing. He says this was why he upgraded to a GPS-enabled mobile. He knew it would simplify life.\nNikhil's experience illustrates a truth now universally acknowledged. A mobile phone is no longer merely a portable alternative to a landline. It can have so much more. Reasonably priced feature-rich handsets may have qwerty keypads, wider screens, touch interfaces. The mobile is increasingly becoming the multi-tasking workhorse of the 21st century:\nenabling the user to surf the net, access emails, get directions, shop or stay in touch with friends on social networking sites.\nAccording to Opera, a popular mobile web browser, page viewing on Indian mobiles has grown 322% from May 2009. It says the number of unique users has grown 324% in the same period. That's not surprising, considering Vinay Goel, Google India products' head, says, that \"the number of mobile users in India with data plans (that allow you to use the internet) has increased 10-fold, from 2.5 million to 25 million in the last two years.\"\nGoel says that almost all phones sold in India today are GPRS-enabled. GPRS or General Packet Radio Service, allows internet access at speeds of anywhere between 56 and 114 kbps. \"Besides the 25 million data plan users, there are an additional 70-80 million using GPRS-enabled phones to download operator applications like ring-tones and wallpapers,\" he says. But the phone is handy in other ways too.\nBOOK TICKETS: Thulasidaran M, a Bangalore-based tech writer, confesses he has quite forgotten the long queues he stood in for years at railway reservation counters. Today, he uses his mobile to book tickets on the Indian Railways website. \"I can even book my tickets while travelling,\" he says.\nHOME SHOPPING: Then there is the shopping. Mobile purchasing is still a nascent phenomenon, but it is undoubtedly catching on. The mall has literally come to your phone as companies tie-up with stores, allowing you to buy almost anything from the comfort of your home. There are a slew of players – Ngpay, mChek, Obopay, Atom Technologies, Paymate – that enable the purchase of airline, railway, bus and movie tickets, pay utility bills and insurance premiums and make hotel bookings.\nTUNE IN: The mobile has also put music at everyone's fingertips. Shubha C S works at Bengaluru International Airport and says FM radio is a boon. \"I spend three hours travelling daily. The only time I relax is when I shut my eyes and\nlisten to music on my mobile,\" she says.\nMOTHER'S HELP: The mobile has become an extraordinary help for the harassed mother. Geetanjali S says she regularly searches the mobile's web browser for new games to amuse her six-year-old. \"When his friends are not around to play, he throws a tantrum. He is bored of the games I have on my mobile. So I keep finding new ones,\" she explains.\nCHEAP INTERNET: Mobile internet has become fairly affordable, with costs coming down almost 300% over the last couple of years. Goel says that Aircel's monthly internet plan for Rs 95 triggered a revolution. \"India is now among the top five countries for data traffic. Data plans here are cheaper than anywhere else. And only a tiny fraction of internet traffic is through high-end phones.\"\nNow, Airtel offers internet vouchers starting at just Rs 7. \"I was surprised when the 15-year-old son of a farmer in Dharwad told me that he uses his pocket money (Rs 100) for phone internet. The cost has influenced rural penetration too,\" says Venkatesh V, CEO of mobile services for Bharti Airtel's Karnataka operations.\nBSNL has made it still more attractive. \"Customers purchasing a 3G data card from BSNL are given free data usage of 6 GB per month,\" says D M Ezhil Buddhan, director (southern region) in the Department of Telecommunications. 3G will further marginalize voice on the mobile phone, given the extremely high internet speeds it promises. Already, BSNL 3G offers TV on the cellphone. Videos will catch on too.\nUnsurprisingly, app stores have become treasure troves. There are more than 2.25 lakh apps in the iPhone store and 60,000 in Google's Android store. Some are severely useful, helping track daily calorie intake. Some are fairly barmy, reproducing, say, the moo of a cow (Hello Cow) or tricking people into believing your phone can detect smells (Smell Scanner).\nNow, Indian telecom operators are creating their own app stores. When Bharti Airtel opened its mobile application store – Airtel App Central – earlier this year, it clocked over 2.5 m downloads in just one month. \"Now, we have over 1,500 apps for downloads and these are as low as Re 1 per day,\" says Venkatesh of Bharti Airtel. The apps range across 25 categories, including business, games, books and social networking.\nThe future seems bright. Micromax has introduced phones that double up as a remote for the TV, DVD and AC. Texas Instruments has helped build what is called a DLP Pico projector into cellphones, which allows one to take a picture or a video and share them instantly on any surface that can take a big projected image.\nIn short, that little device in your hand is becoming the way to achieve almost anything and everything.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e919f8e9-b0cc-45ea-8c4e-79269c8ca389>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-22/telecom/28321253_1_mobile-phone-gprs-enabled-phones-vinay-goel", "date": "2013-05-18T06:46:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9650413990020752, "token_count": 1245, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "24/7 culture, autogenic training, befriend, brainstorming, change, condition, get worse, grieving process, heal, insomnia, lavander, patterns, recharge your battery, rhythms, shiatsu, silence, sleep tight, sleeplessness, speep problem\nIt’s funny how little things can throw us off course. Our body gets so used to its rhythms and patterns that any changes to our daily routine can have a big impact. I really noticed the phenomenon after the clocks went back at the weekend. Just the difference of an hour can affect how we sleep, and our feelings about ourselves as a result.\nSleep problems are increasingly common, thanks to the hectic pace of life today, and the 24/7 culture that expects us to be available whenever, wherever. There are some sleep problems that are largely unavoidable, such as the fatigue associated with parenting babies and small children, nighttime shift work and international travel. But many people still struggle to drop off and sleep soundly, even without intervening factors.\nIt was problems with sleeping that led me to discover Autogenic Training (AT) in 2004. Despite the severity of my insomnia, it disappeared in a few short weeks as I learned how to take my body and mind into a deeply relaxed state. About a year later I began to experience sleeping difficulties again, and was worried that I had relapsed, or that the AT had somehow ‘worn off’.\nHowever, I was reassured to discover that it was just another layer of my development, and that I had several more to go in order to help my body and mind to truly heal. A few things I learned from that experience were:\n- It takes time to develop a condition, and will take some time (but not as long) to heal it. There is no quick fix, whatever we might like to believe.\n- It can help to befriend your condition, rather than view it as an enemy. This will help you to understand what it needs.\n- Things might temporarily get worse before they get better, as if to remind you of your problem’s existence before you can let it go.\n- Your condition might flare up again from time to time, but less severely and for shorter periods. This is all part of the healing process.\nOne of my clients had suffered from insomnia for 50 years, but after five weeks of AT training could sleep for five hours instead of the usual two to three.\nAnother client admits that he does his best business brainstorming when he’s not able to sleep. He actually enjoys these creative times. I’ve observed this with other people too – we may experience a condition for years and wish to change it, but on another level we’re kind of attached to it. We actually need to go through a grieving process and say goodbye to the nights when we enjoyed the silence and mystery of the darkness.\nYou may also find you buy into the ‘romance’ of insomnia, or the competitive sleeplessness that pervades our society. People often boast about working into the small hours and still hitting the gym at 6am. Margaret Thatcher was well known not only for surviving but thriving on four hours’ sleep a night. It’s important if you do hold some positive’ associations with insomnia, that you let them go so you can truly relax.\nSleeplessness should not become a lifestyle.\nHowever you choose to treat your condition, it’s important to regularly recharge your battery. I’ve written about the importance of ‘me time’ in a previous post , and that you enjoy what you are doing. Autogenic Training (AT) has been proven to help with insomnia. If you would like to come for a trial session, please get in touch. Anyone can learn AT. It’s simple, you can practise it anywhere, and the results can be life-changing. You’ve nothing to lose but your insomnia.", "id": "<urn:uuid:13bff664-399a-41e8-b5e9-430a28bd9c19>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://artofrelaxation.org/tag/lavander/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:55:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9683902859687805, "token_count": 816, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "I apologize in advance for how long this is but I need to explain and I need help!\nSo last Monday was the first week at school for students... Wednesday morning, I get my class schedule and see that there are two teachers' names in one class slot. I kept looking at it thinking that surely I must not be understanding it correctly. I started to ask another teacher and then saw my principal. I asked him about it and he said that since we had to add another Kindergarten class this year due to a large enrollment (now 7 classes of 18 students,) the only way to fit them all in the schedule was to send two Kindergarten classes to art at once, 36 students! My jaw literally dropped for like the second time in my life. It took me a minute to process and then I asked where I was supposed to put them! (I currently have room for 24 students.) After talking with my principal and both of us trying to come up with other solutions, he said we could go to the cafeteria and he would get someone to help me. I talked to him today and one of the Paras is going to help with that section. I said that was certainly better than 36 five year olds in my classroom with just me, but I am still really stressed out about it!\nI just feel bad, like those students won't get the same experience as the others. For example, I use my classroom projector ALL THE TIME to teach the art history inspiring some of the projects that I don't have posters for.

Slowly add the buttermilk, coffee mixture, and vanilla, and mix until blended.\nIn a large bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the batter in three additions on low speed, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.\nDivide the batter among the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean, 55-65 minutes. Cool the layers for 15 in the pans, and then carefully invert them onto wire racks to cool completely.\nAnd now, you make the frosting. I chose a recipe found here, at The Way the Cookie Crumbles – recipe #2,\nVanilla Buttercream (from epicurious.com and Gourmet January 2004)\nMakes about 6 cups. (I might have made 1.5 batches for better coverage)\n4 large egg whites at room temperature for 30 minutes\nRounded ¼ teaspoon salt\n2/3 cup water\n1 1/3 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar\n4 sticks (2 cups) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon pieces and softened (next time, I might use only 3 sticks)\n2 teaspoons vanilla\nCombine whites and salt in a very large bowl. Stir together water and 1 1/3 cups sugar in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan until sugar is dissolved, then bring to a boil over moderate heat, without stirring, brushing any sugar crystals down side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in water.\nWhen syrup reaches a boil, start beating egg whites with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until frothy, then gradually add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat at medium speed until whites just hold soft peaks (looks kind of like soap foam). (Do not beat again until sugar syrup is ready.)\nMeanwhile, put thermometer into sugar syrup and continue boiling until syrup registers 238 to 242°F. Immediately remove from heat and, with mixer at high speed, slowly pour hot syrup in a thin stream down side of bowl into whites, beating constantly. Beat, scraping down side of bowl with a rubber spatula, until meringue is cool to the touch, about 10 minutes in a standing mixer or 15 with a handheld. (It is important that meringue is properly cooled before proceeding.)\nWith mixer at medium speed, gradually add butter 1 piece at a time, beating well after each addition until incorporated. (Buttercream will look soupy after some butter is added if meringue is still warm. If so, briefly chill bottom of bowl in a large bowl filled with ice water for a few seconds before continuing to beat in remaining butter.) Continue beating until buttercream is smooth. (Mixture may look curdled before all of butter is added but will come back together by the time beating is finished.) Add vanilla and beat 1 minute more.\nAt this point, if you’ve planned well, you can immediately frost the cooled layers.\nI, of course, did not plan well. It was late at night on a workday, the cake was too warm to frost, and I wasn’t about to stay up. So I put the frosting in the fridge overnight. Moderate mistake – it didn’t change the flavor, but the texture and volume changed. So. FYI.\nFrost the cake – layer cake, frosting, layer cake, frosting, layer cake, and frost everything. Another half batch of frosting would’ve covered the messiness that results from white frosting on a chocolate cake, but then everything might’ve been too rich.\nNow, you slice and eat.\nThis is a very rich cake – eat in small pieces. Freezes and refrigerates well, too. It will be made again.\nTomorrow: the best and only mac and cheese recipe you’ll ever need again.", "id": "<urn:uuid:38c8726c-5a2d-4b48-b810-ac3686f4cb51>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ashinwi.wordpress.com/2010/01/16/tims-birthday-cake-2010/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:08:26Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9207051992416382, "token_count": 1110, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "This is a quick post, not the one on leaky gut syndrome that I promised you! That is not finished yet. This is just to show how ridiculous the lives of chronically ill people can be! It is no wonder I get so little done in a day and am mentally exhausted! This stuff takes a lot of concentration…\nI have started taking digestive enzymes recently as described in my previous post. I have added a high protease (systemic) enzyme to take between meals (to allegedly reduce bodily inflammation and pain among other things). I have also started taking L-Glutamine (though I suspect it has caused diarrhea so I have paused for now to test that, but let’s assume I am taking it. I also read that drinking fluids should be avoided so as not to dilute the enzymes in their very important work, and that if you have low stomach acid the dilution is not good (I don’t know if this applies to me but it could and seems likely) so I should not drink for an hour before meals or two hours afterwards. The protease enzyme is the same rules, but only half an hour before meals is ok. I also take an anti-spasmodic and other medications not related to my digestive issues. I also have in the fridge two probiotics which I plan to start taking soon. I generally need to drink about 4 litres of fluids per day (that’s up to 4x what people usually drink unless it’s hot weather) to help with POTS symptoms.\nSo let’s see what a day looks like if I do this properly:\n8.30am wake up and take my usual medications with water (most of my glasses of water and cups of tea are 1/3 litre).\n9am Get up and have a cup of tea. Take vitamins including zinc (good for digestive/gut health). I really should take more vitamin C too – note to self – it apparently helps kill bad bugs in the gut.\nAlso put Alpha Stim electrodes on my upper back as I do every day (my pain relief machine).\n9.30am take antispasmodic and L-Glutamine\n9.45 take digestive enzyme (as it is a veggie capsule I read it needs time to dissolve so to take it a bit before eating, but other places say to take at the same time as food, so I am confused about this one. Let’s say 15 mins is ok for now.\n10am take probiotic (type one) and eat breakfast\nAlso move electrodes on Alpha Stim to anywhere else that hurts or just to another position for upper back/shoulders.\n11am change setting on Alpha Stim to CES and put earclips on\n12 midday take systemic enzyme and wait half an hour for it to get into my system (think this way round makes sense or I would drink then have to wait an hour?)\nAlpha Stim done.\n12.30 take usual medications and push fluids for half an hour, perhaps 1 litre.\n1pm stop drinking and wait an hour before food\n1.30 take antispasmodic and L-Glutamine\n1.45 take digestive enzyme assuming it takes time to dissolve\n2 – 2.30pm take probiotic (type one) and eat lunch\nGo to bed and rest/nap\n4.30 wake up and take systemic enzyme\n5-5.30pm take usual medications and drink fluids – 1 litre\n6pm take antispasmodic and L-Glutamine\n6.15 take digestive enzyme\n6.30-7pm take probiotic (type one) and eat\n9pm drink – not much as getting late and don’t want to be up all night – 1/3 litre\n10pm – take usual medications and probiotic (type two). Make way to bed.\nSo I have only managed to fit in 3 litres of fluids, plus a bit with tablets. I could take a jug and drink more before getting up. This regime also prevents me eating little and often as I prefer and forces me to make sure I have eaten enough in one sitting to last me 4 1/2 hours. This goes against advice for managing IBS and POTS symptoms. I also really like to finish a meal with a cup of tea, but I have known for a long time this is not meant to be good if you have digestive issues.\nI have tried the systemic enzyme for a few days and that was fine although my stomach seemed to be getting more sore each morning so I am resting it before starting again as is advised. I am unsure about the L-Glutamine but will try it again in a few days. My plan is to do this properly in a couple of weeks and go sugar-free for that time to see if I get any symptoms of die-off to test for a yeast overgrowth. If I feel fine (normal for me!) than it suggests that yeast is not a big issue for me. The more I read about Leaky Gut Syndrome I suspect it may be an issue, despite being quite skeptical, but I think not too extreme for me. I hope so anyway. Even if I cut out all sugars I will still have to eat the diet that I can currently digest which is not very low GI so there will be sugars present (rice/potato) but it will be reduced and that should trigger some reaction. I think taking the probiotics at this time will maximise their efficacy as the bad bugs will be dying anyway - ha ha evil laugh.\nSomeone had generously given me some Stevia to use during my sugar-free fortnight. My plan is to make some chocolate biscotti (I have found a recipe) so that I can end meals with something sweet and also sweeten my breakfast as I will have to switch to unsweetened soya milk (yuk!).\nSorry for the lack of links in this post – I really have no energy/time for it. Please leave a comment if anything is unclear – my next post on Leaky Gut Syndrome (coming in a week or two) should clarify it all anyway!\n*I do not advise anyone to undertake this strange regmen, I know not how useful it will be, only using myself as a guinea pig, as usual…", "id": "<urn:uuid:ae0a4257-9256-4a92-b78d-0ac4c66c5c17>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ashy00.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/too-many-time-constraints/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:56:37Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9687758088111877, "token_count": 1305, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "China's Africa Strategy\nChina's Africa Strategy\nChina's Rise Series\nNEW YORK - In its effort to secure oil and other resources, China has set its sights on Africa, increasingly attracting the world’s attention. While state-owned companies sought out exploration and supply contracts, Beijing courted African governments with trade, investment, debt reduction, and aid packages. There are strongly divergent viewpoints on how this economic diplomacy has impacted China’s efforts to promote a positive image abroad, and what the overall impact of China’s strategy has been on the African continent.\nOn May 5, three experts came to the Asia Society to share their thoughts on this issue. With a range of both complementary and opposing viewpoints, one thing was certain: the effects of China’s Africa strategy are not black and white.\nStephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, China and North East Asia project director at the International Crisis Group, noted that China’s role could be both positive and negative in Africa, but that “China’s investment puts the ball in Africa’s court”; in other words, it is up to African leaders and corporations to take proper advantage of China’s capital and resources. Harry Broadman, economic adviser for the Africa Region at the World Bank, concurred, admitting that a lack of national leadership in Africa made it difficult to take advantage of China’s unconditional investment strategy. Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies and a former vice president at the CNOOC, was more defensive of China’s investments and position of non-interference. At one point, he noted that the CNOOC had not invested in Africa until the Unicom deal was derailed by US protectionism, complaining that the West cannot “have your cake and eat it too.”\nDespite differences in the overall effect of China’s investment, there was consensus that China’s approach to investment—unconditional, and frequently including human capital training, infrastructure development, and worker benefits—had successfully wooed African corporations and governments. However, China may have to transform its strategy as Africa develops a stronger consumer culture and civil society.\nExcerpt: Why is China grateful to African nations?

The attic water heater started raining water into the bathroom below yesterday so we decided it was probably time to get a new one. Now the guy installing it tells me that in addition to the $299 installation fee, I also need to install flexible piping ($60) and that the water pressure coming into my house is too high and that they need to install a new water pressure valve for $199. I think they're ripping me off - I can understand the need for the new piping because the current water heater is connected with rigid copper piping, but I already bought an expansion kit to go with the water heater that I thought controlled the water pressure coming into the water heater. So do I really need to change the water pressure for the whole house?

{"text": "We've all heard it and we all love it, but what exactly is Gangnam Style and what makes it so popular in your opinion?\nThe Korean tried. He really tried to avoid the fad. He thought this was going to blow over in a few days, and everyone will feel a bit silly afterward. But no . . .\nGangnam Style just kept coming on -- 273 million views and counting, appearances on network televisions shows, continuous climb up the charts and numerous homages to the original. (The latest one: from the Ohio University marching band.) Questions about Gangnam Style just kept coming also, even though the Korean has been slower with blog updates.\nSo, FINE. Let's discuss Gangnam Style. First, what exactly is \"Gangnam Style\"? \"Gangnam\" literally means \"south of the river.\" But generally, Gangnam refers to a specific area in Seoul located south of the Han River that bisects the city. The area generally encompasses the northern half of (confusing name alert) Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu, covering neighborhoods like Apgujeong, Sinsa and (confusing name alert, again) Gangnam. It is an area with posh malls, expensive dining and swanky clubs. People who populate those areas are rich, stylish and beautiful, carrying all the appropriate status symbols like imported cars and fancy handbags. They are often celebrities or heirs of Korea's magnates.\nThe Korean was raised in Apgujeong, so he is the original Gangnam man. And it has been a little bit funny to see his old home described breathlessly as some place that \"has no real equivalent in the United States. The closest approximation would be Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Beverly Hills, Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and Miami Beach all rolled into one[,]\" according to the Wall Street Journal (quoting this clueless blogger.) Finding the U.S. equivalent of Gangnam is quite easy: it's West Hollywood / Beverly Hills. It has celebrities, style, money, and nice homes and good schools just behind those flashing lights.\n(Aside: This \"no equivalent in U.S.\" trope is really overused, and in this instance, the comparison is clearly hyperbolic and incorrect. Gangnam is obviously not a Silicon Valley, since there is no huge concentration of tech companies in Gangnam. Nor is it Wall Street -- that would be Gwanghwamun / City Hall area, north of the river, where all the major banks have their headquarters. Gangnam is not Upper East Side either, since Gangnam is decidedly nouveau riche. The old money of the kind that occupies the Upper East Side of New York is found in Yeonhee-dong of Seoul, north of the river. The Miami Beach comparison is too dumb to address.)\nSo when PSY speaks of \"Gangnam Style,\" he means to invoke the trendy, stylish image. But of course, what PSY ends up doing in the music video is a parody of such image. He is wearing a ridiculous suit and dances a ridiculous dance. He appears in decidedly un-Gangnam areas: children's playground, on a paddle boat, riverside park, a bus with a disco ball, etc. A couple of times, PSY does encounter what might be fairly close to a Gangnam-type occasion -- a man driving a fancy car (a cameo appearance by the legendary comedian Yoo Jae-seok,) and a beautiful woman (cameo by Hyuna from the girl group 4Minute) flirting. But those moments quickly dissolve into another round of ridiculous dancing.\n(Aside: If you immediately understood the relevance of the bus with a disco ball, you have a black belt in Korean culture. The \"party\" bus is usually for older Korean men and women, who would like to dance away from the public view. To release their urges to shake it, they would charter these buses with total strangers and have a mobile dancing session. By the way, those old Korean folks dance about as well as your parents. It is probably the most un-hip mobile party in the world -- which fits perfectly with Gangnam Style's aesthetics.)\nHaving said that, what made Gangnam Style so popular?\n(More after the jump)\nGot a question or a comment for the Korean?

The song is catchy, the music video is interesting and funny (and full of hot girls to boot,) and the dance is distinctive. (One recent example that replicates this pattern: Teach Me How to Dougie by Cali Swag District.)\nBut of course, there is more to it, since plenty of Korean pop music that never sees the light of the day still satisfy those criteria, even as a lot of Korean pop musicians deliberately market themselves in the U.S. So what made Gangnam Style stand out? Broadly speaking, there are two reasons.\nFirst, Korean pop music has been laying a solid groundwork for PSY to succeed. It is true that, thus far, efforts by Korea's pop stars to break into the U.S. market resulted in a flop. Top stars like Wonder Girls, Girls' Generation and 2NE1 never made a dent on America's public consciousness. Nevertheless, the groundwork that these groups laid remains important. Because Korean pop music at least got on the radar screen of the insider players of American media market, PSY's music was easily accepted by those insiders.\nThis is a crucial point that separates Korean pop music and pop music from other, non-Anglophonic countries. Through repeated contacts with American media, Korean pop music had a ready audience among American media insiders.\n|The Twitter network map that traces the connection between |\nthe first appearance of Gangnam Style and T-Pain,\nfrom a study commissioned by YG Entertainment, PSY's production company\nSecond, Gangnam Style is popular in America because Gangnam Style is familiar to Americans in multiple ways. The song's electro-pop tune fits right in with the current American music trend, in which LMFAO's Sexy and I Know It is one of the favorites. (Try listening to Gangnam Style right after Sexy and I Know It -- the similarities are enough to think that the same person composed both.) Because the tune of the song is so familiar, it matters less that most Americans have no idea what PSY is singing about.\n(Aside: But do not over-interpret this point and think that PSY was copying LMFAO. PSY has been around for 11 years, and he can be heard composing this self-satirical, electro-pop music pretty early on in his career. For example, check out PSY's 2002 song, Champion.)\nSimilarly, it is not enough to say that Gangnam Style is popular in the U.S. because Gangnam Style is hilarious; Gangnam Style is popular in the U.S. because it is hilarious in a way that is familiar to Americans. The code of humor embedded in the music video -- awkwardness punctuated by bouts of ridiculous non-sequitur (like the guy in a cowboy hat doing pelvic thrust, another cameo appearance by comedian Noh Hong-cheol) -- is very common among American comedy. Ultimately, it is the same type of humor latent in, say, Napoleon Dynamite -- an embarrassing train wreck in which the main character is somehow vindicated through sheer obliviousness and irrational self-confidence.\nThere is a dark side of this code of humor as well. In the current day American pop culture, it is ok to laugh at Asians doing strange things. (Think Ken Jeong's character in the Hangover series.) On a certain level, PSY -- a pudgy, funnily-dressed Korean man -- is a comfortable target to laugh at. This is not to say that people who enjoy Gangnam Style all have a sinister, racist motive. This is only to say that people's motives as they approach a certain phenomenon are complex and multitudinous, and not all of them are necessarily positive.\nThere are certain occasions in which such non-positive motives reveal themselves in a really ugly way. In the Creators' Project concert held in Seoul a few days ago, Korean rap legend Drunken Tiger took the stage. According to Tiger JK, leader of Drunken Tiger, the \"white people\" toward the front of the stage hollered their demands that Drunken Tiger do PSY's horse dance. This led to an angry tirade from Tiger JK: \"Just cuz I don’t dance when i spit. Don’t mean I’m frontin. I salute my homie PSY success.But I don’t have to dance for you cuz I’m Asian.\" In the hands of ignorant people, Gangnam Style will become the new \"ching chong.\"\nA few leftover thoughts about Gangnam Style, and the attention surrounding it:\n1. While the Korean is quite happy that PSY's music is receiving international attention, he cannot believe the ridiculousness of the commentary surrounding this piece. In fact, reading the commentary regarding Gangnam Style was a good way of finding out who knows what he was talking about, and who is simply full of shit.\nThe most frequent type of ridiculousness has been over-analysis. People who otherwise knew little about Korea hung onto every little bit of Gangnam Style, and interpreted every aspect of it as if Gangnam Style were the Bible. The worst offender of this was The Atlantic article on Gangnam Style, which had this gem:\nOne of the first things Hong pointed to in explaining the video's subtext was, believe it or not, South Korea's sky-high credit card debt rate. In 2010, the average household carried credit card debt worth a staggering 155 percent of their disposable income (for comparison, the U.S. average just before the sub-prime crisis was 138 percent). There are nearly five credit cards for every adult. South Koreans have been living on credit since the mid-1990s, first because their country's amazing growth made borrowing seem safe, and then in the late 1990s when the government encouraged private spending to climb out of the Asian financial crisis. The emphasis on heavy spending, coupled with the country's truly astounding, two-generation growth from agrarian poverty to economic powerhouse, have engendered the country with an emphasis on hard work and on aspirationalism, as well as the materialism that can sometimes follow.\nGangnam, Hong said, is a symbol of that aspect of South Korean culture.\n2. Another brand of over-analysis: connecting Gangnam Style to some obscure Korean tradition that has very little bearing in modern Korea. This is from the Wall Street Journal article linked earlier:\nPSY belongs to an established genre of entertainers that pop pundits there have dubbed “gwang-dae,” after a caste of performers traditionally attached to royal households. “Gwang-dae are more clown or jester-like,” says Kang. “They don’t have to be sexy idols to be popular. Their songs are either very humorous, or can sound serious, but with silly lyrics.” . . . The original gwang-dae were given a certain amount of license to critique the aristocracy, offering up satirical commentary on society through their dance, music and repartee.\nOr maybe it makes more sense to focus on Korea's robust modern pop music history. Just a suggestion.\n3. It was also refreshing to see the tired old stereotypes about Korea that get trotted out in the commentary. (The Korean tends to miss them sometimes.) Again, from The Atlantic article:\n\"Social commentary is just not really done in mainstream Korean pop music\"?? Anyone with the most basic knowledge of Korea's pop music history knows this is not true. Off the top of his head, the Korean can name several dozen songs by indisputably mainstream, chart-topping K-pop artists that explicitly made social commentaries, often in a satirical manner. As a quick example, this is how a song from 2000 called 포조리 [Pojori], by DJ Doc, begins. (Note that \"dirty bird\" [짭새] is a Korean slang for police):None of this commentary is particularly overt, which is actually what could make \"Gangnam Style\" so subversive. Social commentary is just not really done in mainstream Korean pop music, Hong explained. \"The most they'll do is poke fun at themselves a little bit. It's really been limited.\"\n새가 날아든다 왠갖 짭새가 날아든다So this song, in pretty explicit terms, criticizes Korean police. (And trust me when the Korean says -- the lyrics get worse.) Oh by the way, DJ Doc's album containing this song (which was the second headlining song) topped the sales chart for three weeks. But nooo -- let's quote the guy who clearly has no idea what he is talking about. We cannot possibly ruin the stereotype about how Koreans are these meek, subservient and humorless automatons, can we?\nBirds fly in, all kinds of dirty birds fly in\n새중에 넌 씨방새~ 날지 못하는 새 짭새\nAmong the birds you are a fuckshit bird, a flightless dirty bird\n새가 날아든다 짭새가 날아든다\nBirds fly in, the dirty birds fly in\n문제야 문제 우리나라 경제 좆같은 짭새와 꼰대가 문제\nIt's a problem, it's problem, the economy is a problem, the dickhead dirty birds and the assholes are the problem\n새가 날아든다 짭새가 날아든다\nBirds fly in, the dirty birds fly in\n짭짭짭짭짭짭 짭새가 문제\nD-d-d-d-d-dirty birds are the problem\n4. While the Korean wishes PSY well, he cannot help but wonder if PSY can achieve a sustainable success. Although the Korean laid out several factors for PSY's success, he cannot tell just how much each factor is weighed. If PSY's musical merit is the greater factor, he will find sustained success. But if catchiness plus being an easy target of laughter are the greater factors, Gangnam Style could simply be another Macarena. Although Gangnam Style is undoubtedly a huge success story for Korean pop music in general, the Korean is still waiting for the true, genuine breakthrough of Korean pop music in the United States.\n-EDIT 9/26/2012- The Korean fixed up some sentences here and there to make the post a bit cleaner. Also, this post about the term oppa might be helpful for those who are curious. Before Gangnam Style took off, that post was one of the first Google search results for \"oppa.\"\nGot a question or a comment for the Korean?

{"text": "Alright, so, I’m a fifteen-year-old girl currently doing grade ten. I eat far too much in the way of carbs, but other than that, I’m not too unhealthy. I procrastinate; I’m not the best friend to have due to my laziness; and I’ve never felt like I belonged anywhere.\nMy problem is this: why do I get so utterly furious so often? Sure — teenage girl, raging hormones, blah, blah, blah — but the tiniest things can set me off, then I’m crying and yelling, often with a mixture of utter rage and guilt boiling in my gut. If this were ‘normal’, the world would have torn itself to shreds by now.\nThere is no history of abuse of any kind in my family, no alcoholics, nothing. I can’t be myself around my family, but then again, can anyone? However, with my father sometimes the sound of his voice literally makes me want to hit him. I love him dearly, but he makes me so mad at the tiniest comment, it’s ridiculous!\nIs there anything I can do to control my rage (especially with my father!)?\nOur Clinical Psychologist’s Reply\nYou began your question by mentioning a few things: a tendency to procrastinate, a sense of not fitting in, an idea of yourself as lazy, and the sense that you cannot be yourself with your family. I understand that these are not the issues you are concerned about, but I mention them because I wonder if they contribute to the bigger picture of your mood and reactions.\nProcrastinating can create stress as the deadline approaches. And I wondered if you have gotten negative feedback from peers about being “lazy.” Conflict with peers, feeling as if you do not fit, and feeling as if you cannot be yourself with your family: these things put together seem to me to leave you with few places or people with whom you are at ease or even happy. If academic stress, a lack of satisfying social relationships, and disconnection within your family do not leave you feeling irritable and/or angry, I would be surprised! For teenagers especially, school and friends are two very important arenas that contribute to both how you feel and how you think of yourself. If you are feeling less than successful with friends, as well as with schoolwork, it would make sense to me if this was spilling over into your mood and temper.\nNow, with that said, while it could be these experiences causing you to have a short or intense temper, it may be something else. Without ruling out more concrete medical or mental health causes for your anger and rage, we would not be able to say for sure.\nYou stated that you have not been abused or had to deal with alcoholism in your family. This is good. But I wonder about other ways that your experiences and your family’s mental health history could be playing into what you are experiencing. You did not mention whether mood disorders (such as depression or bipolar disorder) or other mental health problems (such as ADHD or other impulse control disorders) run in your family.\nSo, I have mentioned circumstances as well as biological causes. However, most often it is not either/or. Typically, it is both/and. What I mean is, what is inside you (neurochemistry and hormones) and what is going on outside you (situations and relationships) interact together to cause behavior. For example, if depression runs in your family, you might be predisposed to have a low or irritable mood. This may never occur, but if you were to add in an ongoing stressful situation at school, conflict with friends, or a culture of perfectionism and criticism in your family (just as an example), you might find that depression symptoms are triggered.\nSo, regardless of the cause, you are wondering what you can do to control your temper. Sometimes it can be helpful to identify a pattern with regard to what is making you angry. For example, when your father says X, Y or Z, it really sets you off. If you can start to see how certain kinds of comments he makes or ways that he interacts with you trigger you, then you can consider speaking with him about it. Often in these situations, it is best for people to approach a sensitive topic when they are feeling calm, rather than mentioning it in a moment of anger. For example, one might say, “I’ve noticed that when you comment about X, Y, or Z, I feel really frustrated.” Often when approached calmly, people are willing to discuss ways of changing the problem together.\nHowever, sometimes they are not! Let’s imagine that your father is going to continue to say the things he says that make you mad, no matter what. There are a few strategies you can use in the moment. Deep, abdominal breathing can help your body move from the physical agitation that anger can bring, over to a more relaxed state. Breathe, filling your belly with air, as you count to three. Hold the breath for three counts, and then blow it slowly out as you count to three again. If you do this several times, you might find that you feel more calm. Another anger management technique is to “talk back” to your anger in the moment to avoid acting out in a way that will worsen the problem. For example, you might say something in your head to yourself such as, “I am feeling really angry, but I can wait to say what I need to say.” You can also search online for additional information about anger management for teens.\nIt is absolutely normal to have feelings of irritation, anger, even rage at times. However, if these feelings are beginning to feel like the norm instead of the exception, you might find that speaking to an adult and obtaining help is a next step. For some kids, parents are the first people in whom they want to confide. If you are not comfortable talking to your parents or other family members, your pediatrician or school counselor might be a neutral, safe adult who can offer ideas or point you in a direction to get some help.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f812d5fd-e2d6-4ffc-a808-ad64b2a1c75e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://askthepsych.com/atp/2012/08/01/a-15-year-old-girl-how-can-i-control-my-rage/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:02:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9704811573028564, "token_count": 1291, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Namely:\n- I've tried installing a newer kernel (3.3+), since some people have reported success with it. That didn't seem to fix the resolution problem.\n- I've tried installing an older version of Ubuntu (10.04), since someone suggested there's an older driver that should provide basic support for the card, but the liveCD image wouldn't boot.\n- I've tried using this ppa. On first reboot, the screen resolution was correct. Subsequent reboots lead to a blank screen immediately after grub.\n- I've tried passing the kernel option\nvideo=1024x600with the above PPA, to no avail.\n- I've tried installing a daily build of Quantal. The live image boots with the correct resolution. The installed system boots to a blank screen. The\nvideo=1024x600option doesn't work here either.\n- On Quantal I've blacklisted the\ngma500_gfxdriver to force the use of\nvesa.

{"text": "By Elaine Orr\nFew studies about labor force growth and change have captured the nation’s attention as did the Hudson Institute’s1987 report, Workforce 2000. Part of it was the fascination of a new millennium and our need to examine where we were and where we are going — witness books such as Megatrends and its sequel– and part was the style of Workforce 2000. There was no need for a degree in labor economics to understand it.\nBut the media’s misinterpretation (or at least mis-presentation) of parts of the report also catapulted it to prominence. Headlines blared that by 2000, white men would make up only fifteen percent of the American workforce. In fact, the report said that the number of white men in the workforce would grow more slowly than women or nonwhite men, and white men would comprise approximately fifteen percent of new entrants to the workforce by 2000. This was a big change from the 1950s-1970s, but not unexpected given that society had become less biased about women and African Americans or Hispanics going to college, and baby-boomers were not going to inhabit the one wage-earner world of their parents.\nGovernment and private companies sought a more diverse workforce, and while some complained that there was reverse discrimination, over time the workplace ultimately did what it has always done — employers tried to get the talent needed for the best price. Lately, employers have had quite the pickings.\nIn 2004, the RAND Corporation (for the U.S. Department of Labor) examined what it saw as three major factors that were “expected to shape the world of work in the coming decades: shifting demographic patterns, the pace of technological change, and the path of economic globalization.” It concluded, among other things, that technological advances would continue to increase demand for a highly skilled workforce. The report saw this as one factor that would support higher productivity growth and change the organization of business and the nature of employment relationships.”\nThe Hudson Institute’s Workforce 2020 addressed how companies needed to adapt to an aging workforce and change jobs to accommodate technology changes, and how trends such as telecommuting, temporary staffing, and employee leasing affect the workplace. Boston College’s Sloan Center on Aging and Work issued Engaging the 21st Century Multi-generational Workforce (prepared for Met Life), which examined levels of “employee engagement” and how it might vary by age.\nThe themes of technological change and age were everywhere. College students looked at those studies (or at least articles about them) and considered them as they picked majors. While technology and aging baby boomers continue to resonate in reports about the workforce and potential careers, what no one could have predicted even five years ago was that the Great Recession would make many reports outmoded before they had time to accumulate dust on a library shelf. (A shelf? Don’t you mean the digital files would be corrupted?)\nBaby boomers, who were expected to retire in such droves that there would be excruciating talent shortages, have watched retirement nest eggs shrink and many remained at work — at least those who have kept pace with newer workplace technologies. However, those same boomers paid for the education of their children and grandchildren and now must open their doors to let them back in when the economy did not seem to want the skills of recent graduates — or the jobs just plain end. Grandparents and parents don’t like that anymore than the unemployed graduates.\nThose who find work relatively quickly are graduates of specialized programs whose curricula relate directly to specific skills employers need. Many nursing and laser manufacturing programs at community colleges turn away students by the bushel.\nThe Great Recession may have done us one favor. We appreciate our jobs more, and more people consider two-year degrees that lead to profitable careers. This hardly makes a master’s degree in public administration obsolete, but the skills used after graduation may be those that deal with budgeting more than public policy. The economy seems to have enough thinkers, it’s looking to doers to set the pace for the next decade.\nThere is not truly a dichotomy between graduates who are thinkers or doers, of course, and not everyone needs to be a database manager, pharmacist, or physical therapist (gotta love those aging baby boomers). If graduates with a public sector management perspective cannot find a job quickly there are some strategies that may help.\n- Take a tip from young actors. No one will think less of you for doing part-time or volunteer work in your field while you make a living doing something outside of your hoped-for career field. And yes, it can be typing, table waiting, or sales.\n- Acquire more skills. Can you build a web page or maintain a small network? As web design or management moves beyond a discipline to a skill, if you can spend five hours a week updating a web page you will be a more attractive candidate than the job-seeker who still sees web work as a separate field. Community college courses are reasonably priced, and your Internet provider may provide free hosting, so practice is free.\n- Learn the ins and outs of public sector budgeting. Emphasis now is on making cuts, but even as tax revenues increase again, states and municipalities will continue to confront rising costs to maintain infrastructure or pay for employee pensions. See if you can be an intern for a local city or county as it prepares its budget. There is a major crunch (and no more staff) to draft the annual budget for a city council or county board of supervisors to approve, and even in a small town the city manager or budget director could appreciate your time. Even if you don’t go into public budgeting, what you learn will be useful throughout a career.\n- Ask currently employed workers in your hoped-for field to give you a fifteen-minute interview to describe what they do and the skills needed. You will learn something and it gives a potential employer a chance to know you without having to tell you there is no job.\n- Start a blog that deals with the area in which you want to work. You can write some, but you can also ask others in the field to write guest posts. You learn more and you are known as committed to your field.\n- Keep reading. Who would have thought Workforce 2020 would be read on a Kindle?\n- If all else fails, ask your parents or grandparents to stop postponing retirement. You may not get their job, but a friend might. Let the older generation stay home and start a blog.", "id": "<urn:uuid:72ec42ef-f9ce-45e1-8463-bdb5e6ec4832>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aspanational.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/changing-workforce-changing-job-hunting-skills/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:08:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9696837663650513, "token_count": 1359, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Aaand here we go to one more post of Assassin's Creed goodies ^^\nToday we go over Assassin's Creed Revelations revelations! XD\nFirst we have this awesome list of news gathered by User:Stormbeast on a blog of his, one which I am now reposting here for everyone to see ^^ I believe he will keep updating it, and when he does, I'll relay the info to all as always =]\nSince it has a truckload of spoilers, I'm listing it under the spoiler tag, click the \"show\" button to unveil the known features and reveal the truth!\n- If you get close enough to a person, e.g. following Yusuf at the beginning of the game, Ezio will go into autopilot and walk with him.\n- All memories concerning the Keys in Constantinople will be accessed through Sofia. The Altair memories within the Keys will be relatively short, but engaging. You do not have to activate the Key as soon as you touch it, leading to possible replay-ability of Altair memories as well.\n- There is an achievement/trophy for reaching the top of Hagia Sophia in under 30 seconds.\n- You can take a break from playing Ezio and return to Animus Island with Desmond through the menu. Doing so, Desmond can talk to Subject 16 and even hear the voices of Bill, Shaun, and Rebecca from the outside world. It is noted that Bill trained both Desmond and Lucy at a very young age.\n- Ezio can control his speed whilst zip-lining. (the faster option will attract a guard's attention)\n- You can test out bombs while crafting them to see their effect.\n- The 'random quests' can be anything, including moving 5 boxes across a street.\n- While disguised as a minstrel, the face buttons (X,B,Y,A on Xbox) has Ezio use different songs, mostly about Cesare. Pressing the right control stick activates Eagle Sense.\n- Ezio will aquire the Armor of Ishak Pasha, the Revelations counterpart of the Armors of Altair and Brutus.\n- Ottoman guards are marked on the mini-map with a yellow dot.\n- Ezio will fill the new HQ with books in place of paintings.\n- Ezio has all his old gear (including parachutes and the crossbow) from the beginning. Tunnel Booths have also returned.\n- Assassin recruiting will be more diverse than just saving civilians from guards. Some can be done through quests, e.g. catching a counterfeit thief or winning a race. The new Recruits will be categorized, involving the weapon they are most skilled in. In order to reach the level of Assassin and Master Assassin, your Recruit and you will have to track down a Templar Agent.\n- There are Animus Data Fragments throughout the city for Ezio to collect. These appear to look similar to the AC2 loading symbol.\n- The second Key is under Galata Tower. The only video we have is of Ezio almost falling to his doom.\n- The second Altair memory will take place directly after Al Mualim's death, leading to a fight with Abbas Sofian's followers and climbing to reach Abbas Sofian to retrieve the Apple. (Be careful of the Apple's pulses while climbing)\n- The third Key is housed in the Forum of Ox. In order to get there, Ezio must use Eagle Sense while perched on a view point to pick up hidden symbols leading him there. The Forum of Ox features a chase with Templars in a boat as riflemen shoot at Ezio.\n- The third Altair memory takes place after Altair's son, Sef, is killed. Not much is known other than Altair having to fight fellow Assassins to escape Masyaf.\n- So far the confirmed Templar Agents are the Crusader, Renegade, and Vanguard. (Multiplayer related)\n- There will be 5 new maps (Galata, Antioch, Knights Hospital, Souk, and Ippokratous) as well as 4 returning maps from Brotherhood. (Mont St. Michel, Rome, Castel Gandolfo, and Venice) \"Training Ground\" as seen in the Beta is now confirmed to be a 'noncompetitive, untimed mode' allowing you to 'explore the map, practice your abilities, and kill assigned target VIP' NPCs. (Multiplayer related)\nSources for the info listed above can be found on his blog post.\nSo that is all for today! Post your comments below – me and the staff want to hear your opinions! Safety and peace, folks.\n\"Give what you have.

{"text": "21 Lower Freeborn\nThe Pantry project is a direct response to the growing need among the UC Davis student population for more aid and resources to help offset the Financial burden of the current economic climate in combination with rising fees, textbook costs, and living expenses. It is becoming increasingly difficult for students to juggle the costs of living while working to obtain a University degree, and thus many students are finding themselves choosing between basic essentials such as food and toilet paper and the required costs of college. It is for this reason that The Pantry has been established to help offset these financial burdens and ensure that students may continue on to successfully complete and obtain their degrees from the University of California, Davis.\nThe Pantry is the result of a campus-wide collaboration between the Associated Students of the University of California, Davis (ASUCD), the Community Advising Network under the umbrella of Counseling and Psychological Services, and the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.

{"text": "\"Helplessness\" and \"confusion\" are words that easily come to mind when the issue of sick building syndrome is mentioned. It is a problem that does not have a regulatory solution, and is bound with engineering, medicine and emotions that will challenge the best of school administrators.\nA careful management style and knowledgeable use of technologies in medicine, toxicology and property maintenance are a school administrator's best allies in preparing to deal with or prevent this new generation of health and safety challenges.\nDefining sick building syndrome There is no regulatory definition for sick building syndrome. Although it often relates to indoor-air-quality problems, it simply means that the environment of a building is inspiring complaints of discomfort and/or disease.\nFundamentally, the causes of sick buildings relate to architecture and engineering patterns institutionalized in school construction following World War II. Schools of glass, rock and wood, with high ceilings, cross-ventilation via a transom over the door, and windows and radiators that could be adjusted by teachers no longer were built. These schools were being replaced with new, factory-like buildings featuring a temperamental, eccentric system of master controls for indoor environment. Buildings were constructed with no regard to the environment around them or to people within the property. Today, allowing for the ambiguity in defining sick buildings, somewhere between 1-in-5 and 1-in-15 school facilities are in a situation where discomfort and disease can be attributed to operations of the building.\nHealth symptoms in a sick building are highly variable, but generally split into three categories:\n-Radical reaction--a number of people clearly and suddenly ill. This usually involves limited air exchange combined with a \"smoking gun,\" which can include a new chemical cleaner, misbatched chlorine in a pool area, a weather inversion preventing a kiln from venting properly or a failure of a mechanical air-exchange system.\n-Unhealthy atmosphere--many people experiencing ongoing subtle illness or discomfort. The most common symptoms involve the dehydration of sensitive tissue, including sore eyes, throat or nasal membranes; a feeling of lethargy; a higher incidence of upper-respiratory infection; asthmatic reactions; low-grade headaches; and a continuum of muscle pain and general discomfort among building occupants. Much of this relates to oxygen deprivation typically caused by oxygen being displaced by other compounds, and occasionally by infestation of microbes as a result of excessive moisture remaining within the property.\n-Hypersensitive reaction or multiple chemical sensitivity reaction--one or two individuals extremely ill. This can result if even tiny exposures occur to anyone that has a highly sensitive reaction to certain chemicals. Typically, these complaints should be viewed as warnings that some low-level toxin is in the area.\nAlthough sick building syndrome usually relates to the general nature of the building itself, there are some specifics that account for most indoor-air problems:\n*Combustibles; any possible introduction of carbon monoxide. *Moisture as it may relate to mold (look for growths on drywall). *Moisture as it may relate to airborne infectious agents (standing water and consequent growths). *Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), usually cleaning agents or building materials, which may give off unpleasant, sometimes toxic gases. *Formaldehydes in new carpet, pressed wood or other building products. *Any new or newly exposed particleboard. *Applied poisons (pesticides, insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides).\nA proactive approach Administrators are dealing with a generation of post-World War II properties prone to indoor-air-quality problems, particularly buildings constructed or remodeled during the 1970s energy crisis. A school district should take several steps before a problem strikes. First, initiate patterns for preventing air-quality problems. Second, establish baseline information that will profile the building to facilitate an efficient, inexpensive and confidence-inspiring response. Building occupants and the community need to see a clear and confident administrative approach should a problem arise in the future.\nThe proactive investigation of the building should involve a limited amount of basic testing, particularly a professional review of the microbial matrix within the building--the number of colony-forming units or what kinds of microbes presently are nesting in the building. Understanding what is living in the ambient air can help administrators understand if there is a problem or, more importantly, can help to quickly isolate the exact nature of a problem.\nSimilarly, administrators should consider hiring an outside contractor to review how air-handling and mechanical-engineering systems are managed. A knowledgeable person should walk the area and observe the mechanical systems to see how the filtering system, the air-dispersion system and the air-dilution patterns of the building are operating. Finally, a reliable epidemiological profile of comparative absenteeism should be archived.\nAdministrators also need to be ready to implement a smooth, confidence-building reporting system for occupants regarding air-quality or sick-building concerns. How fast and capably the district responds can be the key to getting the issue under control. The costs for responding to indoor-air problems decrease dramatically if there is baseline data and a plan in place.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f673350f-8b06-4580-b54b-a3217aacfede>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://asumag.com/mag/university_prescribing_cure", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9389723539352417, "token_count": 1048, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "McLouth makes impact with homer, leaping grab\nRunning into wall, O's left fielder starts key double play to end Yanks' threat\nNEW YORK -- Hot for more than a month, Nate McLouth saw red for an entire inning Thursday night.\nLeading off the fifth, the Orioles left fielder drilled a fastball out to right at Yankee Stadium. Then, in the bottom of the inning, he made a leaping catch at the wall as he crashed into an electronic red sign he said was blindingly bright. That saved a run and started an inning-ending double play.\n\"I mean, it almost blinded me,\" McLouth said of the State Farm sign.\nBefore the O's took Game 4 of the American League Division Series, 2-1, over the Yankees in 13 innings, McLouth's homer was Baltimore's only run for 12 innings.\nThe O's leadoff man has been their best hitter this series, and he homered on a 1-2 pitch from Yanks starter Phil Hughes that got too much of the plate. That put Baltimore up, 1-0, and came after McLouth had walked and doubled in his first two plate appearances.\n\"It was obviously a mistake,\" said McLouth, who's hitting .333 (6-for-18) with two runs scored and three RBIs in the series. \"I think [Hughes] was trying to come in and didn't get it there. But you know, to get us on the board there, to get a lead there, it was the fifth inning, it was nice. I put a pretty good swing on it.\"\nMcLouth has hits in all four games of the series, coming off his hottest month of the season, September, when he posted a .298/.372/.491 line. At an opportune time like this, he said he's feeling as good as he has all year.\n\"I really do,\" McLouth said. \"It's funny, when you feel good, and you get good pitches, you don't miss 'em. When you're struggling, you'll foul those pitches back. I just, yeah, I've been able to slow things down at the plate, and I think that's kind of what any hitter will tell you when they're feeling pretty good. They're able to stay under control.\"\nThe catch in the bottom of the inning was remarkable in itself. The 7-6-3 double play he started with a relay to J.J. Hardy made it that much sweeter.\nThe Yankees had a runner on first base with one out, and Jayson Nix, starting at shortstop in place of Derek Jeter, hit a deep drive to left. McLouth raced back to the left-field wall, leapt and came up with it as his left side hit against the sign. His jump was well-timed, so he didn't hit the wall with overwhelming force.\n\"That's that deep part out there,\" McLouth said. \"I went back, I knew it was going to be close to the wall. And I took my eye off the ball for a second and it was kind of weird, because when I took my off the ball, I looked right into -- there's like a bright red State Farm [sign] out there -- and I mean it almost blinded me. Because I wanted to check where the wall was, but I just happened to look right at that bright sign, and it kind of threw me off for a second. But I was able to pick up the ball again when I looked back.\"\nEssentially, McLouth preserved the shutdown inning, and all the momentum he himself had created with the home run.\nFrom his vantage point, catcher Matt Wieters wasn't sure McLouth had a chance at the ball, but he wasn't surprised by the play. To Wieters, the O's have two center fielders: one playing that position, Adam Jones, and the other playing left, McLouth.\n\"I didn't know he had it, but I knew if he had a chance, Nate was going to come down with the ball,\" Wieters said. \"He ran a long way for that ball, and was able to get it and make a good throw to J.J. to get a double play. That was a huge out in the game, and something that gave us a little bit of relief, to get back in the dugout with the lead.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:ec0c647d-051b-48d6-a486-b8c106f4aff2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121011&content_id=39730740&vkey=news_bal&c_id=bal", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:29Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9906680583953857, "token_count": 919, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Ethiopian kids hack Zoom tablets in five months.\nThe One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project recently tried a new approach to distributing computers to developing countries, by leaving boxes of tablets in remote Ethiopian villages with no instructions. The Motorola Zoom tablets had a custom English language OS, a solar charger, and tracking software to monitor how they were used.\nTo the surprise of the organization, not only could the kids who started using the tablets easily figure out how to switch on and use them, but they also learnt to hack into the OS and enable features - amazing especially seeing as most of the kids had never seen a printed word before, let alone in English.\n“We left the boxes in the village. Closed. Taped shut. No instruction, no human being. I thought, the kids will play with the boxes! Within four minutes, one kid not only opened the box, but found the on/off switch. He’d never seen an on/off switch. He powered it up. Within five days, they were using 47 apps per child per day. Within two weeks, they were singing ABC songs [in English] in the village. And within five months, they had hacked Android. Some idiot in our organization or in the Media Lab had disabled the camera! And they figured out it had a camera, and they hacked Android.”\nOLPC used the experiment to see whether kids can teach themselves to read and write English. Research shows that 100,000,000 kids worldwide don’t even make to to first grade, often because there are no schools or teachers available. For the cost of a tablet, that could all change. Previous OLPC studies have also shown that the kids will also teach their parents to read and write as well.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9dc0e204-f56c-43cf-b426-74e04dd58130>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://augustobre.tumblr.com/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:44:01Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9698531031608582, "token_count": 364, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "May 7, 2012 § 2 Comments\nThe Last of a Half-breed / on The Death of Jim Loney by James Welch\nWelch’s sad book is set in mid-70’s rural Montana somewhere on the outskirts of the Fort Belknap Indian reservation. In this tragic story, cheap alcohol fuels a prevailing sense of alienation and longing for an imagined elsewhere—life should be better somewhere else. A perennial overgrowth of American Indian under-education, alcoholism and infighting captures the reader in a depressive continuity of life’s potential for hopelessness. Welch gives us a masterful retelling of boredom amidst the desolation of failed dreams. This is an American Indian story of existential angst that goes far beyond a clichéd and ghettoized other. Welch leaves us with a narrative that calls into question the very real confrontation with Jim Loney’s identity as a so-called half breed (Gros Ventre/Anglo), his broken family, his restless love life, and his hard-to-place value as a fallible man. James Welch’s The Death of Jim Loney soberly regards the plight of the American Indian, troubled personal identity, and the existential problems that arise from filial neglect and societal estrangement.\nWe always have to be cautious when confronting racial issues and how they are addressed, especially with regard to the personal bias we bring to such matters. Although Welch does write about an American-Indian, he tells the story from the uneasy perspective of Jim Loney and his immediate relationships. This story is one of human identity, an identity that’s become displaced, and then broken. We already come to the novel knowing that American-Indians have been displaced in their own land, but in The Death of Jim Loney existential problems of belonging lie underneath the poverty of Loney’s day to day circumstances. If any American-Indian issues are politicized in the book, they are carefully implied and are not overt. In fact, such issues of displaced identity are suggested by Welch with graceful subtlety. For example, when Welch writes about Loney’s half-breed status, he has Loney’s girlfriend Rhea suggest to him that to be a half-breed is to be lucky to choose from one set of ancestors or the other: “Oh, you’re so lucky to have two sets of ancestors. Just think, you can be Indian on one day and white the next. Whichever suits you” (2008, p. 13). The naïve irony of his girlfriend’s comment does little to comfort us (and him) since we know that society doesn’t give us this choice. Here in America, if you are born half white and your other ethnic half is a minority group, you must identify as that minority group, if you don’t, you’re flatly dismissed as being in a state of self-hating denial.\nIf you happen to belong to a minority group, any resulting problems of racial and personal identity are left for you to sort through openly, or not. If you don’t have the tenacity to deal with it, this can lead to strong feelings of displacement and a general sense of not belonging. But is this is somehow a uniquely American-Indian dilemma? We already know that it’s not; we don’t have to be American-Indian to question our place in the world. One doesn’t need to be a minority to contemplate one’s existence. However, with this said, we’ll have to acknowledge that a minority status can lead to feelings of alienation. Displacement from the larger group can lead one to feel like an outsider.\nThis takes us to the philosophy of Existentialism. The general focus of Existentialism is on the existence of the individual and the choices he makes from there, if he is able to recognize that his existence relies on his own self-determinism and not on an external morality, or objective standards of living. In the strictest sense, he always has the freedom to choose one way or another. Let us be sure to make the point that Welch’s Loney never tries to philosophically solve his existential dilemma, we’re only left with his broken family life, his semi-romantic love life, his tenuous friendships, his alcoholism, his violence, and his eventual demise. We are matter-of-factly presented with all these unresolved problems of his existence that lead Loney to a self manipulated death. In Colin Wilson’s first book The Outsider he covers the Existentialism of the alienated outsider from the philosophical perspective of many authors and thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche wrote at length about overcoming the status quo, about questioning existence and the power of the individual to forge a new path above and beyond the prevailing norms. Welch’s Jim Loney is precariously at the precipice of this kind of rejection of the way things are—he is on the very edge of transcendence—yet he never gets there, he just doesn’t know how. “He [Loney] tried to think of all the little things that added up to a man sitting at a table drinking wine. […] all the people and events were hopelessly tangled as a bird’s nest is his mind” (Welch, 2008, p. 18). Loney inadvertently shows us that personal growth can’t flourish if we absent-mindedly drink away our thoughts. In The Outsider, Wilson speaks of the way Nietzsche had to reject the complacency of traditional values in a society that stifles free thinking: “Unless he can evolve a set of values that will correspond to his higher intensity of purpose, he may as well throw himself under a bus, for he will always be an outcast and a misfit” (1956, p.142). Loney never gets to a higher purpose. His goal is not to challenge tradition. Loney’s choices are (self) limited.\nLoney’s existence awkwardly stares at him, and by extension we try to think of how this reflects our own lives. It’s only by his inability to squarely lift himself up from his plight, do we confront a desire to do this for ourselves. This problem of Loney’s is carefully expressed by Welch when Loney watches a neighbor hanging her laundry. He does this while contemplating where his life should lead from here. “He wasn’t ready to do anything but sit on his step and think, and so he watched the two shirts twist and knot around each other and he thought, not of Seattle, but of the blue veins on the backs of his neighbor’s legs” (2008, p.42). This kind of contemplation with the bare facts of reality recall Jean Paul Sartre’s character Antoine Roquentin in the book Nausea, and his famous existential epiphany with a chestnut tree, yet with one critical distinction: Loney can’t see a way to transcend his basic choices. He can’t grasp his own basic existential freedom. In Nausea Sartre writes: “Existence is not something which lets itself be thought of at a distance: it must invade you suddenly, master you, weigh heavily on your heart like a great motionless beast—or else there is nothing more at all” (1964, p. 177). For Sartre man’s very confrontation with nothing and of existence impels him to grow into what he wants to be. Loney doesn’t know he can change, therefore Sartre would say he was acting in ‘bad faith.’ When we’re acting in bad faith we are not acknowledging our freedom to choose another way, we’ve blindly accepted our so-called fate. In bad faith we are the victims of circumstantial fatalism.\nWelch’s Loney is opaque and inaccessible to himself, he “…couldn’t sleep because if he slept he would dream, so he stared into the blackness of the small bedroom” (2008, p. 94). A few lines later, Loney thinks of the next day where he’ll be hunting bear with his sometime friend Myron Pretty Weasel, where he blankly thinks: “After tomorrow’s slim purpose I will simply exist” (Welch, 2008, p. 95). These are frightening thoughts when we learn later that Loney will shoot the curiously named Pretty Weasel, presumably mistaking him for a bear in the cattails. In Julia Kristeva’s psychoanalytic/philosohical work Strangers to Ourselves, she details the complex ways an outsider is perceived and how they perceive themselves. It’s made clear that the foreigner internalizes much of their perceived self-identity and hatred, as much as society imposes these insecurities onto the other. We’ll be safe to suggest that American-Indians have been a kind of native foreigner, sadly thought of as foreigners on their own homeland. This becomes a kind of self-exile enacted by Loney’s futile escape from belonging to his family or anywhere else as he eventually runs headlong unto his death at Mission Canyon. Kristeva writes: “…according to the utmost logic of exile, all aims should waste away and self-destruct in the wonderer’s insane stride toward an elsewhere that is always pushed back, unfulfilled, out of reach” (1991, p. 6). Although Kristeva is not an Existentialist, her views on foreigners, the stranger, the other do coincide with Loney’s lack of belonging that leads to a feeling of being exiled within his own family and community. Loney is never ‘at home’ in the world.\nWe never really understand where Loney’s going except down. The rambling intensity of his actions are magnified by the coldness of his estranged father Ike, especially when Loney suggests that their situation could’ve been better. Ike ignorantly questions this: “Shit, what would we have done but drink ourselves to death?” (Welch, 2008, p. 132). After this, Loney walks away from his dad’s trailer and shoots into one of the windows with the shotgun his dad gave him minutes earlier.\nIf we return to the very first page of the story, we find Loney recounting an odd Biblical passage that sticks itself in us because of its bald pessimism. “Turn away from man in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?” (Welch, 2008, p. 1). We’re not told that this is from Isaiah 2:22, but that doesn’t matter when we think of what it means, and what it might mean for Loney. Turn away from a breathing man, because there is not accounting for him because he’s mortal. This has to be a Biblical way to emphasize the fallibility of man against an all perfect God. Yet, for our secular use here, the haunting phrase speaks to a darker message: no one living is to be trusted. Loney came from the chaos of a broken home. As we witness his confused adult life, his options are few. Loney in his depressive complacency barely trusts anyone. Midway in the book, a little boy named Amos After Buffalo watches Loney cut his dead dog from the frozen mud on Thanksgiving day—a day that’s not really an American-Indian holiday. This little boy is recalled before Loney dies where Loney talks to a stray black dog in Mission Canyon. “You tell Amos that Jim Loney passed through town while he was dreaming. Don’t tell him you saw me with a bottle and a gun. That wouldn’t do. Tell him you saw me carrying a dog and that I was taking that dog to higher ground. He will know” (Welch, 2008, p. 147).\nJames Welch’s The Death of Jim Loney carries us over to a deep sense of sadness. This in-depth sadness is brought about by Loney’s inability to maneuver his circumstance to even a slightly better place. His displaced existence glares at him and it hurts us to have read about it. It is in this liquor-fuelled alienation that we can learn to empathize with people, as we can recognize such tendencies in ourselves. It is as the philosophers show us, that it is our choice to blindly accept fatalism, the status quo, the norms, the way-it-should-be, or not. If we can’t do this hard work of liberating ourselves nobody else can do it for us. This ultimately reveals how James Welch has helped us, by showing what life looks like when we refuse to see ourselves as full of potential, and when we fail to see ourselves as living with pure possibility.\nKristeva, Julia.

{"text": "These wise words from Tolstoy seem even more relevant 100 years on.\nMatt Ridley has published a great essay in WIRED SCIENCE today. Ridley nails an issue that has plagued humanity since time immemorial. Some supposedly intelligent human beings become so convinced that Doomsday is upon them that nothing will persuade them to the contrary. Ridley’s essay is a must read for everyone interested in Doomsday predictions that have failed to materialise and why we should dump the Climate Scare in the same basket.\nWhen the sun rises on December 22, as it surely will, do not expect apologies or even a rethink. No matter how often apocalyptic predictions fail to come true, another one soon arrives. And the prophets of apocalypse always draw a following—from the 100,000 Millerites who took to the hills in 1843, awaiting the end of the world, to the thousands who believed in Harold Camping, the Christian radio broadcaster who forecast the final rapture in both 1994 and 2011.\nReligious zealots hardly have a monopoly on apocalyptic thinking. Consider some of the environmental cataclysms that so many experts promised were inevitable. Best-selling economist Robert Heilbroner in 1974: “The outlook for man, I believe, is painful, difficult, perhaps desperate, and the hope that can be held out for his future prospects seem to be very slim indeed.” Or best-selling ecologist Paul Ehrlich in 1968: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s [\"and 1980s\" was added in a later edition] the world will undergo famines—hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked on now … nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.” Or Jimmy Carter in a televised speech in 1977: “We could use up all of the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade.”\nPredictions of global famine and the end of oil in the 1970s proved just as wrong as end-of-the-world forecasts from millennialist priests. Yet there is no sign that experts are becoming more cautious about apocalyptic promises. If anything, the rhetoric has ramped up in recent years. Echoing the Mayan calendar folk, theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock one minute closer to midnight at the start of 2012, commenting: “The global community may be near a point of no return in efforts to prevent catastrophe from changes in Earth’s atmosphere.”\nAPOCOHOLISM IS GROWING\nOver the five decades since the success of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 and the four decades since the success of the Club of Rome’s The Limits to Growth in 1972, prophecies of doom on a colossal scale have become routine. Indeed, we seem to crave ever-more-frightening predictions—we are now, in writer Gary Alexander’s word, apocaholic. The past half century has brought us warnings of population explosions, global famines, plagues, water wars, oil exhaustion, mineral shortages, falling sperm counts, thinning ozone, acidifying rain, nuclear winters, Y2K bugs, mad cow epidemics, killer bees, sex-change fish, cell-phone-induced brain-cancer epidemics, and climate catastrophes.\nSo far all of these specters have turned out to be exaggerated. True, we have encountered obstacles, public-health emergencies, and even mass tragedies. But the promised Armageddons—the thresholds that cannot be uncrossed, the tipping points that cannot be untipped, the existential threats to Life as We Know It—have consistently failed to materialize. To see the full depth of our apocaholism, and to understand why we keep getting it so wrong, we need to consult the past 50 years of history.\nRidley takes the reader through a modern day analogy of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.\nThe classic apocalypse has four horsemen, and our modern version follows that pattern, with the four riders being chemicals (DDT, CFCs, acid rain), diseases (bird flu, swine flu, SARS, AIDS, Ebola, mad cow disease), people (population, famine), and resources (oil, metals).

{"text": "The Independent Jane\nFor all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.\nElizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.\nThe freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.\nAlthough Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.\nWhen accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,\n“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”\n“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”\n“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”\nThat same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.\n“Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”\nI find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.\nJohn Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.\nComparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.\nJefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers.

ISSN 0022-460X http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20101213-104516314\n- Published Version\nRestricted to Caltech community only\nSee Usage Policy.\nUse this Persistent URL to link to this item: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20101213-104516314\nThe one-dimensional response of a subsonic nozzle flow to small pressure and entropy disturbances is calculated. The response is expressed in terms of transmitted acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle in the same direction as the disturbance wave) and reflected acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle in the direction opposite to that of the disturbance wave) for three independent disturbances: a downstreampropagating acoustic wave impinging upon the nozzle inlet, an upstream-propagating wave impinging upon the nozzle exit, and an entropy wave convecting through the nozzle. The solution for high frequency disturbances is discussed and used with the compact (long wavelength disturbance) solution to normalize several numerical calculations. The normalization shows that the transmitted waves created by the two acoustic disturbances may be represented by the same function offrequency for a given inlet and exit nozzle Mach number. The same is seen to be true for the reflected waves created by the two acoustic disturbances. The normalization allows results for a wide range of nozzle Mach number distributions and disturbance frequencies to be presented concisely.\n|Additional Information:||© 1977 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(April 2013)|\nThe Hindenburgdamm Rail Causeway across the Wadden Sea to the island of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany\n|Ancestor||None. (See Ford (crossing))|\n|Related||None. (See step-stone bridge)|\n|Descendant||None. (See viaduct)|\n|Material||Concrete, masonry, Earth-fill|\nA causeway is a road or railway route across a broad body of water or wetland raised up on an embankment. Some causeways may only be usable at low tide and the distinction between causeways and viaducts can become blurred when flood-relief culverts are incorporated in the structure; a causeway is however primarily supported on earth or stone, whereas a bridge or viaduct is mainly supported by free-standing columns or arches.\nWhen first used, the word appeared in a form such as “causey way” making clear its derivation from the earlier form “causey”. This word seems to have come from the same source by two different routes. It derives ultimately, from the Latin for heel, calx, and most likely comes from the trampling technique to consolidate earthworks. In Ancient times, the construction was trodden down, one layer at a time, often by slaves or flocks of sheep. Today, this work is done by machines. The same technique would have been used for road embankments, raised river banks, sea banks and fortification earthworks. (The layers, though not the trampling action, can be seen in the Bayeux Tapestry: Building Hastings Castle.)\nThe second derivation route is simply the hard, trodden surface of a path. The name by this route came to be applied to a firmly surfaced road. It is now little-used except in dialect and in the names of roads which were originally notable for their solidly made surface.\nThe word is comparable in both meanings with the French chaussée, from a form of which it reached English by way of Norman French. The French adjective, chaussée, carries the meaning of having been given a hardened surface, and is used to mean either paved or shod. As a noun chaussée is used on the one hand for a metalled carriageway, and on the other for an embankment with or without a road. Other languages have a noun with similar dual meaning. In Welsh, it is sarn. The Welsh is relevant here, as it also has a verb, sarnu, meaning to trample. The trampling and ramming technique for consolidating earthworks was used in fortifications and there is a comparable, outmoded form of wall construction technique, used in such work and known as pisé, a word derived not from trampling but from ramming or tamping.\nThe modern embankment may be constructed within a cofferdam: two parallel steel sheet pile or concrete retaining walls, anchored to each other with steel cables or rods. This construction may also serve as a dyke that keeps two bodies of water apart, such as bodies with a different water level on each side, or with salt water on one side and fresh water on the other. This may also be the primary purpose of a structure, the road providing a hardened crest for the dike, slowing erosion in the event of an overflow. It also provides access for maintenance as well perhaps, as a public service.\nNotable causeways include those that connect Singapore and Malaysia (the Johor–Singapore Causeway), Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (25-km long King Fahd Causeway) and Venice to the mainland, all of which carry roadways and railways. In the Netherlands there are a number of prominent dykes which also double as causeways, including the Afsluitdijk, Brouwersdam, and Markerwaarddijk. In Louisiana, two very long bridges, called the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, stretch across Lake Pontchartrain for almost 38 km, making them the world's longest bridges (if total length is considered instead of span length). They are also the oldest causeways on the Gulf Coast that have never been put out of commission for an extended period of time following a hurricane. In the Republic of Panama a causeway connects the islands of Perico, Flamenco, and Naos to Panama City on the mainland. It also serves as a breakwater for ships entering the Panama Canal. Its English name causeway is sometimes confused with \"Coastway\", name of a touristic zone in Panama city. The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan had causeways supporting roads and aqueducts. The oldest engineered road yet discovered is the Sweet Track in England, dating from the 3800s BC.\nCauseways are also common in Florida, where low bridges may connect several man-made islands, often with a much higher bridge (or part of a single bridge) in the middle so that taller boats may pass underneath safely. Causeways are most often used to connect the barrier islands with the mainland.\nThe Churchill Barriers in Orkney are of the most notable sets of causeways in Europe. Constructed in waters up to 18 metres deep, the four barriers link five islands on the eastern side of the natural harbour at Scapa Flow. They were built during World War II as military defences for the harbour, on the orders of Winston Churchill.\nThe Estrada do Istmo connecting the islands of Taipa and Coloane in Macau was initially built as a causeway. The sea on both sides of the causeway had become shallower as a result of silting, and mangroves had conquer the area. Later on land reclamation took place on both sides of the road and the area has subsequently be named Cotai and become home of several casino complexes. In Okinawa, Japan, connected by the Mid-Sea Road are the Katsuren Peninsula, Henza Island, Miyagi Island, Ikei Island and Hamahiga-Island.\nSpecific causeways around the world \n|This section requires expansion. (April 2009)|\nVarious causeways in the world:\n- Canso Causeway, Nova Scotia, Canada ( )\n- Hindenburgdamm, Germany ( )\n- Johor-Singapore Causeway ( )\n- Lake Ponchartrain Causeway, Louisiana ( )\n- King Fahd Causeway, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia ( )\n- Venice ( )\n- Mahim Causeway, Mumbai, India\n- Swarkestone causeway, Derby, England, United Kingdom\n- Causeway across Haraldssund, Faroe Islands\n- Causeway across Hvannasund, Faroe Islands\n- Rømødæmningen, Denmark, connecting Rømø (island) with the mainland across the wadden sea\n- MacArthur Causeway, Florida, United States\nCauseways affect currents and may therefore be involved in beach erosion or changed deposition patterns; this effect has been a problem at the Hindenburgdamm in northern Germany. During hurricane seasons, the winds and rains of approaching tropical storms--as well as waves generated by the storm in the surrounding bodies of water—make traversing causeways problematic at best and impossibly dangerous during the fiercest parts of the storms. For this reason (and related reasons, such as the need to minimize traffic jams on both the roads approaching the causeway and the causeway itself), emergency evacuation of island residents is a high priority for local, regional, and even national authorities.\nSee also \n- The Causeway, Western Australia\n- Causey Arch, County Durham, England\n- Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Metairie, Louisiana, Southern; Mandeville, Louisiana, Northern.\n- Pulaski Skyway\n- Oxford English Dictionary. 1971.

{"text": "Great news for pilots: After at least 10 very slow years, the aviation industry is in a period of growth. Experts predict that we'll encounter a drastic pilot shortage in the coming years, which means that your dream job may not be as far away as you thought!\nIf you're looking for a flying job, here are a few links to check out:\nIf you're a low-time pilot, then US Pilot is a great site to start with. It is updated constantly with flight instruction, banner towing, aerial mapping, part 135 and corporate pilot jobs. Membership is free.\nPopular among defense companies, AviationEmployment.com typically has a lot of job postings for test pilots and military veterans.\nThis widely-used website has been around since 1988, and according to their website, is the leading site for aviation and airline jobs. On Avjobs.com, you can learn about and search for pilot jobs, read articles, browse through tips and advice, search for an aviation school, subscribe to newsletters, and even get help with your resume. All of these services come with a charge, though. There are different payment plans for different services, with discounts for students and military members.\nAviation Week reaches over 185 countries, so their job board includes job openings from around the world. You'll see a variety of jobs here, but it's another hot spot for defense jobs and government contract jobs at places like Boeing, Northrup-Grumman, Sikorsky, and the military. There are a few corporate and flight instructor jobs openings listed here, as well.\nThe FAA hires pilots to create and inspect operations, both in the air and on the ground. Pilots for the FAA can inspect airways, test and identify problems with terminal and enroute procedures, etc. The FAA will surely be hiring more pilots to assist with the implementation of NextGen, so check out the FAA jobs website for updates.\nAvianation.com is another job site that charges monthly or yearly fees to search and apply for jobs. The website boasts that they offer the most variety of job postings for low-time to high-time pilots. It's good for pilots looking for a global career, as well as cargo operations. The site does seem to incorporate information from a variety of sources. As with any site that charges, be careful you aren't paying for information you could be getting for free (such as job postings from the FAA and NTSB, which can always be found on the respective individual websites).\nThe monster of all job search sites, Monster.com is always a good place to look. It's a little light on the aviation jobs, especially flying jobs, and you might have to weed through the ads and irrelevant work-at-home jobs to find what you need. But Monster is a good tool for those of you that can relocate. There are a lot of postings for metropolitan areas, but you may notice that there are few listings for smaller cities and towns.\nSimilar to Monster.com, you may get lucky and find a few pilot postings here if you can get through the ads and unrelated postings. Be aware of the many pilot jobs for military careers (unless that's what you're looking for). The posts rarely disclose the military commitment required up front, and it can be a time-waster if you don't actually desire (or qualify for) a flying career in the military.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e8c9d87e-f09d-4871-a795-82aaf7aa2d3a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aviation.about.com/od/Resources-for-Job-Seekers/tp/The-Best-Job-Search-Websites-For-Pilots.htm", "date": "2013-05-18T06:01:47Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9629371166229248, "token_count": 696, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "See this related question - it's about the video production's vibe that Sony Vegas in \"unprofessional\" compared to Avid (who make ProTools) and Final Cut.\nLet's start with this: FLStudio it's a tool with which you're familiar. That's a huge plus in terms of learning curve for getting things done.\nWith DAWs, the output is comparable. ProTools can't make better ones or zeros than any other package. There are going to be inherent differences in the audio codecs depending on which one ships with whose products.\nThe tool, in and of itself, it not the issue. Professionalism comes from a.) the recording quality and b.) the skill of the engineer. Record with a crappy mic that's not been properly placed in a room that's not properly soundproofed, and Bob Katz himself couldn't fix it. Conversely, mic it right and choose the right place to record, and if you know your tool, you can create awesome recordings.\nShould you switch? That's up to you, but here are some things to consider:\n1.) Can you accomplish everything you need to record and output great audio with FLStudio?\n2.) Will you ever have a need to exchange files with someone else...e.g., will you ever need to send your stubs to a mastering studio? And is the output you send them compatible with, most likely, ProTools or Live?\n3.) How important is it that it's compatible with other studios' equipment?\n4.) Can FLStudio output redbook compliant CD image files?\n5.) How important is it that you have an image of professionalism? Will you lose business because of your software? or will you retain business, regardless of software because of your mad audio skillz?\nIf you know how to make great audio, that's where the professionalism comes from. Not the software. Yes, there may be solid business reasons to invest in one package or another, mostly revolving around the extent to which you'll share files to collaborate. Secondary will be for marketing purposes...but honestly, with some great demos, you can overcome the second quite handily.\nSoftware is nothing more than a tool.

{"text": "\"GOT NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES\"\nIt is September 19,1783. The place, Lyons, France. Preparations are being made for a journey. A journey that will eventually take man from his secure environment of terra firma, and place him in a hostile environment called the atmosphere. The vehicle to be used is a hot air balloon. The brainchild behind this trek is a wealthy paper maker named Joseph Montgolfier. There has been much speculation over just how Montgolfier made the discovery of the hot air balloon. The most commonly-believed story is that his wife was standing too close to a fire and that the smoke caused her skirt to be inflated and lifted above her knees. This caused Montgolfier to wonder-if this smoke, and its magical lifting powers, could be captured in a very large container, it might rise and lift a passenger along with it.\nSo, Montgolfier went about building the first hot air balloon. In 1783,\nnot much was known about the atmosphere and its effects on human beings.\nUpon examination of the occupants for any ill effects caused by this lofty height, it was discovered that the duck had a broken wing. Could this have been an effect of exposure to altitude? Actually, several observers noted that as the balloon left the ground, the sheep had an anxiety attack and kicked the duck. Montgolfier reasoned that it would be safe for humans to ascend to altitude. So on November 21, 1783, Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier (a surgeon) became the first aeronaut and flight surgeon. Over 200 years have passed since that first flight. Technology has allowed us to ascend through the atmosphere and into space, but the hazards of high altitude flight (hypoxia, altitude-induced decompression sickness, and trapped gases) will always be present. That is because humans are best suited to live in what is known as the \"physiological efficient zone\". This zone extends from sea level to 12,000 feet. When humans are exposed to altitudes above this zone, they are subjected to physiological hazards beyond their natural ability to adapt.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that everything that occupies space and exerts weight is considered to be matter. All matter is made up of atoms and molecules in varying densities. These particles within the matter are kinetic and in constant motion. The slower the motion of the particles, the more dense the matter becomes. Also, as the particles are pushed closer together, the matter also becomes more dense. The best way to slow down kinetic molecules is to cool the matter. The best way to get them to move closer together is to add pressure to the matter. Inversely, when you remove the pressure or heat any material, the molecules within the material moves faster and further apart, thus making the material less dense.\nThe least dense form of matter is, of course, gas. If a gas is cooled and compressed, at some point it will become a liquid. If that liquid is then cooled further, then at some point it will become a solid. Also, when you take the pressure off any gas or liquid, that material will grow less dense and expand. This is essentially what happens to the gaseous molecules of our atmosphere.\nOur atmosphere contains approximately 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, a constant ratio until you reach an altitude of about 270,000 feet. So the question that always comes up is; \"If I have 21% oxygen at sea level and 21% at 40,000 feet, why do I succumb to the effects of hypoxia within 20 seconds at that altitude?\"\nThe answer is, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE! If you could picture all the gaseous nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, they would stack up from the surface of the earth to the fringe of space. All these molecules stacking on top each other create a great deal of weight, or pressure. At sea level, one square-inch of any surface has about 15 pounds of air sitting on top of it. At 18,000 feet, that same square inch has only 7.5 pounds per square-inch (psi) exerted on it. What has caused this atmospheric pressure drop? The answer is simple: There is more air stacked up at sea level than above 18,000 feet, and therefore, more weight.\nAs you recall, when molecules are subjected to this pressure, they are going to move closer together. This will make the air more dense with oxygen and nitrogen molecules. For example, if at sea level you take in a breath of air that has an atmospheric pressure of 15 psi, then that air may contain 500 billion molecules of oxygen (this a fictitious number to be used only as an example); if you go to 18,000 feet and take the same breath where atmospheric pressure is 7.5 psi, then you will pull in only 250 billion molecules of oxygen. But, you require 500 billion per breath to function normally, and you're getting only half of what you need. That's HYPOXIA!\nNot only do gaseous molecules in the atmosphere expand with reduced total pressure, gases in the human body are also subject to the same expansion. There are several areas in the body- ears, sinuses, lungs, gastro-intestinal tract, and teeth - where these gases can expand and cause a variety of problems. As long as the gas can expand and escape, there will be no problem. But if the gas becomes trapped, then pain will be the usual result.\nAs we have discussed earlier, the air we breathe contains about 79% nitrogen. Nitrogen is inhaled into the lungs and distributed and stored throughout the body. According to gas laws, gases of higher pressure always exert force towards areas of low pressure. When you inhale nitrogen, it will be stored at a pressure of about 12 psi (79% nitrogen) of 15 psi (total atmospheric pressure), equal to about 12 psi).\nWhen you ascend to altitude and the pressure around your body begins to drop, this creates a pressure gradient (higher nitrogen in the body than outside the body) and the nitrogen will try to equalize and escape outside the body. Sometimes this nitrogen can leave so quickly and in such quantify that it may form a bubble. If this bubble forms at a body joint, the pain it causes is know as \"the bends.\"\nThese are just a few of the problems that can occur when the human body is exposed to high altitude conditions. These problems will always be there for aviation.

{"text": "Fudgy Chocolate Stout CakeMarch 13, 2012 at 8:17 pm | Posted in cakes & tortes, simple cakes, sweet things | 6 Comments\nTags: baking, cake, chocolate, dessert, holiday\nApparently I think Saint Patrick’s Day is a good excuse to drench chocolate cake in booze. OK, I would gladly do that any day of the year (as is evidenced by this and that), but last year I marked St. Paddy’s day with whiskey-soaked chocolate and now I’ve moved to stout. Chocolate stout cakes are nothing new, but I am loving the ease of this one. So easy, you can whisk this together while sipping the remainder of your can of Guinness or Murphy’s and be confident you won’t muck it up.\nYou may notice that this cake is vegan. I’m not, but I can appreciate that the lack of eggs and dairy let the chocolate flavor of this cake shine. The stout and espresso boost that taste and temper the sweetness. There’s so much liquid in this cake that it stays moist and fudgy…improves with time even. Three days later and I think it’s better than the first. I’ll raise a pint to that!\nFudgy Chocolate Stout Cake- makes an 8″ cake\nfrom mrslarkin’s recipe on food52\n1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1 cup granulated sugar\n7 tablespoons natural cocoa powder (not dutched)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup Guinness or other stout\n1/2 cup espresso or strong coffee\n1/4 cup water\n2 teaspoons vanilla\n1 teaspoon apple cider or white vinegar\n1/2 cup vegetable oil\n-Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Set oven rack to middle. Grease an 8” round cake pan with cooking spray, then line with parchment and lightly spray the parchment.\n-Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.\n-In a measuring cup, mix together stout, coffee, water, vanilla and vinegar. Stir into the flour mixture a few turns, then add your oil and combine until you have a smooth batter (you can use a whisk for this, just be gentle).\n-Pour into prepared pan. Place in oven and bake for 30-35 minutes. Check with cake tester, which should come out very slightly moist. Remove from oven and let cool on rack.\n-Turn out onto cake plate. Peel off the parchment. Dust cake with powdered sugar, or cover with frosting.\n*Alternatively, this recipe makes 1 dozen cupcakes. Bake for 18 – 23 minutes. Cool cupcakes. Frost with your favorite frosting or dip tops into a simple icing made of confectioner’s sugar, cocoa powder and coffee. Decorate top with a fresh coffee bean while icing is still tacky.", "id": "<urn:uuid:33ef3ca2-2215-44b3-b6b3-1b02ff0b2283>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://awhiskandaspoon.com/2012/03/13/fudgy-chocolate-stout-cake/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:54:47Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9054388403892517, "token_count": 620, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "In my previous post about the command pattern, I gushed about how much I loved it. That doesn’t mean that the command pattern as originally envisioned is still completely in fashion.\nIn particular, the notion of “Undo” was one of the major features in the command pattern’s cap. Today, that is almost never the case. Sure, if you are building an application such as an editor. Something like Photoshop or a text editor would find the notion of commands with the ability to have an undo stack very compelling. Other than that, however, that is a very rare need.\nIn most business scenarios, there really is no good way to undo things. How would you implement SendEmailCommand.Undo(), for example? But even something like PlaceOrder.Undo() is a lot more complex and hard to do than you would think. The mere notion of undoing the operation assumes that this isn’t going to have any side affects. But cancelling an order may result in cancellation fees, require you to ship back things you got back, end. It is not “Undoing PlaceOrder”, rather that is a whole different and distinct business process, usually represented by another command: CancelOrder.\nAnother common issue that people have is the degeneration of the entire architecture to something like:\nTo that I answer, more power to you! I love code that is composed of a lot of small classes all doing things about the same way. There is no easier way to look at a system, and that allows you to quite easily add additional functionality to the system easily. That said, mind how you handle routing in that scenario. I have seen people go into the “when a request comes to this URL, let us invoke the following commands” in XML. One of the reasons that people dislike this approach is how you actually call this. If just getting to the command executer is hard and involved, you lose a lot of the advantages.\nThis popped up in the mailing list, and I really dislike it. The notion of Composite Command. A command that can execute multiple commands. Now, from a programming point of view, I can easily see why you would want to do that. The PlaceOrderCommand operation is composed of a lot of smaller commands. But, and this is important, the notion of Composite Commands basically mean that you get the same thing as the PlaceOrderCommand, but you just lost the name. And naming is important. Almost as important, error handling is quite different between different business scenarios, and you sometimes end up with something like:\nAnd this is simple, how do you handle an error in the ShipOrderCommand after you already charged the card, for example?", "id": "<urn:uuid:f209779a-44bd-48da-8eac-183944c1f68c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ayende.com/blog/159969/design-patterns-in-the-test-of-time-command-redux?key=a4f5a0b6-d2c6-4949-bc44-e9d567d16340", "date": "2013-05-18T06:49:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9652654528617859, "token_count": 561, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "I joke a little that \"breakfast\" around here involves nuking some eggs and peeling a banana.\nIt's not really a joke.\nIn the morning I generally pour out some egg whites into a little dish, microwave them for about a minute and a half, peel and chop a banana and some strawberries, and maybe make up some toast if I've decided to allow bread in the house that week.\nErin isn't yet at an age where she can use utensils, so I don't serve up anything like cereal. Fruit and eggs. That's what she gets.\nAnd, every once in a while I'll try to make pancakes.\nI want to be able to make pancakes.\nAsk most people who I've cooked for and they will probably say that I am a decent cook (even if I go through phases where everything has to have cinnamon or honey in it). But I don't bake. I can't handle the precision of baking. Cooking is a dance, there is a rhythm behind manic actions and the knife is shining, flickering grace.\nBaking feels like engineering.\nI realized recently that pancakes, although not involving the oven whatsoever, qualify as baked goods. This would explain why I keep screwing them up.\nFirst, there was the \"baking soda or baking powder\" fiasco. Which one do you add to the batter to help it puff a little while cooking? I kept forgetting, and I'd add baking soda instead of powder and I'd end up with little hockey pucks.\nThen there is the \"eggs or no eggs\" question. It seems as if adding eggs just encourages the batter to rubberize. But without eggs all I end up with is cardboard.\nAnd let's not even start on the counter-intuitiveness of the idea that getting the pancakes to cook through the middle without burning on the outside requires a high heat in the pan, and a quick turn, instead of a medium heat with a slow turn. Anything else cooked in that pan that I want to be cooked evenly requires a lower heat and a slow turn. But I have to forget all of that when I'm using a reactive batter that does weird things when heat is applied. Or else I end up with blackened discs of raw dough.\nBatter. That term alone should have clued me in that the normal cooking rules do not apply with pancakes.\nOne cannot eyeball the amount of baking\nsoda powder to be added to the flour. You can't just \"feel out\" how much sugar to add to the batter, or how long to whisk the batter so the eggs don't get overbeaten and rubberize the mixture.\nSo, finally, after four unsuccessful attempts at good pancakes in four weeks, I pulled out my Cooking A-Z and looked up the blueprints for basic pancakes. I promised to follow the instructions to the letter. Except that I was so confident in the awesomeness of the pancakes that were about to be served up to my starving daughter that I got a little fancy and chopped up a banana to add. Banana pancakes. Because if her dad really loved her he'd man up and put fruit in it.\nMix, chop, whisk, pour, sizzle. Oh wow. Those look amazing. They are fluffing up perfectly. I'm going to turn them now. Oh, look at that, they are perfectly golden brown. Take them from the pan. Cut one up a little for Erin. Taste.\nTaste. What the hell? Why do they taste so weird?\nRecheck the blueprints.\nBaking powder? Check.\n1/4 cup of sugar? Che.....\nOh. I don't actually keep sugar in the small white jar on the counter. I keep it in the medium white jar on the counter.\nI keep salt in the small white jar.\nDammit. 1/4 cup of salt in my batter. I lose at baking.\nEmily suggests I buy the pre-mixed Bisquick jug, since I've now ruined 5 batches of batter in a little less than a month. But even though this last batch proves that the pancakes aren't to blame, that I am just completely incompetent when it comes to making pancakes, I will persevere.\nI will become the best damn pancake batter maker around.\nBecause breakfast should be something more than nuked eggs and a peeled banana.", "id": "<urn:uuid:298ae1b4-5c0c-4baf-aa7d-968ffd5178c7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://backpackingdad.blogspot.com/2008/08/here-here-are-keys-to-my-kitchen-take.html?showComment=1218217200000", "date": "2013-05-18T05:23:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9625734090805054, "token_count": 909, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "To first make sure we're on the same page, here's how peer review works today. You write a manuscript and submit it to a journal, where it is assigned to an editor. Exactly what happens then depends somewhat on the journal. In some cases the editors sort out a lot of submissions already at this stage. At very high impact journals like Science and Nature, editors reject the vast majority of papers not because they're wrong but because they're not deemed relevant enough, but these journals are exceptions. In the general case, your manuscript will be assigned a number and be sent to one or several of your colleagues who (are thought to) work on related topics and who are asked to write a report on your paper. That's the peer review.\nThe assignment of people to your paper doesn't always work too great, so they have a chance to decline and suggest somebody else. At least in my experience in most cases the manuscript will be sent to two people. Some journals settle on one, some do three. In some cases they might opt for an additional report later on. In any case, the reviewers are typically asked for a written assessment of the manuscript, that's the most important part. They are also asked whether the manuscript is suitable for that particular journal. And typically they'll have to judge the manuscript on a 5 point scale on how interesting the content/good the presentation is etc. Finally, they'll have to make a recommendation on whether the paper is suitable for publication in the present form, whether revisions should be done, have to be done, or whether it's not suitable for publication. The reviewer's judgement is anonymous. The author does not generally know who they are. (That's the default. There is in principle nothing prohibiting the reviewer from contacting the author directly, but few do that. And in some cases it's just easy to guess who wrote a report.)\nIn most cases the report will say say revisions have to be done. You then revise the paper, reply to the queries and resubmit. The exchange is mediated by the editor and can go back and forth several times, though most journals keep this process to a few resubmissions only. The whole procedure can take anything between a few weeks and several years. In the end your paper might get rejected anyway. While in some cases one learns something from the reports, the process is mostly time-consuming and frustrating. The final decision on your manuscript is made by the editor. They will generally, but not always, follow the advice of the reports.\nOn the practical side, the manuscript- and review-submission is typically done through a web interface. Every publisher has their own labyrinth of usernames, passwords, access codes, manuscript-, article tracking-, and other -numbers. The most confusing part for me is that some journals assign different author and reviewer accounts to the same person. I typically write reports on one or two papers per month. That's more than ten times the number of manuscripts I submit. There are very few journals who pay reviewers for their report. JHEP announced some while back they would. Most people do it as a community service.\nThere are several well-known problems with this procedure. Most commonly bemoaned is that since the reviewers are anonymous they might abuse the report to their own advantage. That might be in the form of recommending the author cites the reviewer's papers (you're well advised to do that). In the worst case they might reject a paper not because they found a mistake but because it's incompatible with their own convictions. One can decline to review a paper in this case due to \"conflict of interest,\" but well. We have all conflicting interests, otherwise we'd all be doing the same thing. What happens more often though is that the reviewer didn't read or at least not think about the paper and writes a sloppy report that might accept a wrong or decline a right paper mistakenly.\nI have written many times that the way to address these community-based problems - to the extend it's possible - is to make sure researchers' sole concern is the advancement of science and not other sorts of financial pressure, public pressure or time pressure that might make it seem smart to down-thumb competitors. But that's not the aspect I want to focus on here.\nInstead I want to focus here on the practical problems. One is that the exchange between the author and the reviewers is unnecessary slow and cumbersome. Submitting a written report and having it passed on by the editor must be a relic from the times when such a report was carved in stone and shipped across the ocean. It would be vastly preferable if journals would instead provide an online interface to communicate with the author that preserves the anonymity of the reviewer. This would allow the reviewer to ask some quick, clarifying questions and not only make their task easier, but also prevent misunderstandings. Typically, if the reviewer has misunderstood something in your manuscript you have to do a lot of tip-toeing to tell them they're wrong without telling them they're wrong because, you see, the editor is reading every word and knows who they are. The idea isn't that such a communication interface should replace the report, just that it could accompany the review process and that a written report is submitted after some determined amount of time.\nAnother practical problem with today's peer review process is that when your paper gets rejected and you submit it to another journal, you have to start all over again. This multiplies efforts on both, the authors' and the reviewers', sides. This is one of the reasons why I'm suggesting to decouple the peer review process from the journals. The idea is simply that the author would submit their manuscript not for publication to a journal, but first to some independent agency to obtain a report (or several). This report would then be submitted with the manuscript to the journal. The journal will still have to assess whether the manuscript is suitable for this particular journal, but the point is that the author has a stamp of legitimacy independent from a journal reference. It's up to the author then what to do with the report. You could for example just use the report (in some summarized form) with an arxiv upload.\nThere could be several of such peer review agencies, and they might operate differently. Eg some might pay the reviewer, some might not. Some might ask for a fee, some might not. One would see which works best. In the long run I would expect the reports' relevance to depend on the reputation of the agency.\nThis would address several problems at once. One is the by the open-access movement frequently criticized \"power of journals.\" That's because in many, if not most, fields a journal reference is still considered a sign of quality of your work. But journal subscriptions are very costly, and thus the pressure to publish in journals often means scientific studies are not freely accessible for the public. The reason is simply that today subscription journals are the main providers of peer review. But there is actually no reason for this connection. Decoupling publication from the review process would remove that problem. It would also address the above mentioned problem that when your manuscript gets rejected from one journal you have to start all over again with the peer review. Finally, it would add more diversity to the procedure in that the reviewers and authors could chose which agency suits them best. For example, some might have an anonymous, and some an open review process. Time would tell which in the end is more credible.\nThere is the question of financing of course. Again, there could be several models for that. As I've said many times before, I think if it's a public service, it should be financed like a public service. That is to say, since peer review is so essential to scientific progress, such peer review agencies should be eligible to apply for governmental funding. One would hope though that, as today, most of the time and effort would be carried by the researchers themselves as a community service.", "id": "<urn:uuid:bba56f0c-8fd6-4b59-a1f8-0d239b752452>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2010/04/peer-review-vi.html?showComment=1270558561950", "date": "2013-05-18T06:27:27Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9736339449882507, "token_count": 1623, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "|Commissioners put off decision on sand mines|\n|The Press - News|\n|Written by Mike Anderson|\n|Thursday, 21 June 2012 15:11|\nA jam-packed Baker County Commission meeting room on the evening of June 18 left no doubt where the vast majority of people in attendance stood on two proposed sand mining proposals.\nThey wanted them buried and gone.\nIt didn’t seem to matter how safe or harmless to the environment the applicants promised the mining would be, nor that the mined areas eventually would be reclaimed. It also didn’t matter how much of an economic impact they claimed the operation would have in the county.\nMost of the approximately 80 people, many of whom had to stand during the proceedings because there were only 45 chairs in the room, were against the mining plans and urged county commissioners to side with them.\n“What is the actual benefit to the county?” asked Macclenny resident Pat Shannon, adding that the mining companies would use billions of gallons of water while only employing a handful of workers and adding a negligible amount to the county’s coffers in taxes.\n“It just doesn’t add up,” he said. “I’m concerned about whether my grandchildren and great-grandchildren will have enough water to drink. Water is a precious commodity and we can’t give that up.”\nAfter more than three hours of testimony from mining company officials and hearing from a parade of homeowners on the opposite side of the issue, county commissioners rejected a motion to deny the mining requests and postponed a final decision for two months.\nOld Castle Southern Group, a Tampa-based company, plans to mine 193 acres of a 437-acre tract it leases from DuPont east of SR 228 about two miles south of Interstate 10. The firm, which owns a road-paving company and a concrete plant, also has a contract to buy another 700 acres, which could extend the life of the proposed mine to 50 years.\nE.R. Jahna Industries Inc., a family-owned business in the Central Florida town of Lake Wales, leases 960 acres owned by TerraPoint LLC, a subsidiary of Rayonier, just north of three residential subdivisions off US 90 at Trailridge. There, Jahna plans to mine coarse sand used to make siding, concrete blocks, stucco and other products.\nDuring a public hearing that began about 6:30 pm and didn’t end until just after 10 pm, others expressed similar views that the proposed deal would be slanted too much in favor of the mining companies.\n“The return is not there for the people of Baker County,” said Kirk Schiner of Shelly Lane, adding that drinking water is “not a never-ending supply.”\n“We need good air and good water to survive,” Richard Cooper of Elvin Starling Road said. “If you want to pass this, how about a tax per ton of sand that they want to take out of here?”\nThen, turning his attention to a group of Old Castle representatives seated in the audience, Mr. Cooper said, “You can’t reclaim the land because you’ve hauled it all off.”\nAnother critic was Allison Broughton, a former member of the county’s Land Planning Agency, which recently recommended approval of the two mining applications. She spoke against the measures as zealously as she fought a recent attempt by another company to obtain a zoning exception to build a medical waste incinerator north of the Walmart Distribution Center.\n“It has a negative impact on our entire county,” Mrs. Broughton said of the proposed mining plan. “I don’t think there‘s any doubt about that. A handful of jobs is not worth the depletion of our natural resources. We gain almost nothing by allowing these mines to come in.”\nShe said she had nothing personal against any of the company officials or representatives present at the hearing, whom she looked at when she described them as “out-of-town business people.”\n“They don’t live here,” said Mrs. Broughton.\nPlans submitted by the two mining companies assert the sites will not produce any air pollution and they will be buffered by trees and vegetation to minimize noise and keep their operations out of sight.\nThey also said the mines, which use floating electric-powered hydraulic dredges, extract water from deep in the Floridan Aquifer and would have no impact on private wells, which draw water from shallower portions of the aquifer that are not affected by water withdrawals from deeper levels.\n“We’re willing to spend more money to go to an aquifer that is not used in this county,” said Old Castle consultant Mark Stephens, a geologist and engineer from Lakeland. He said the company plans to drill 1,200 feet deep to draw water from the lower aquifer.\nDuring the first five years, Mr. Stephens said, about 3.5 billion gallons of water would be extracted from the aquifer, after which the amount of water withdrawn from underground would drop sharply because by that time the previously withdrawn water can be reused to continue daily operations.\nNonetheless, Macclenny City Manager Gerald Dopson urged commissioners to proceed cautiously.\n“We feel these mining proposals will be in the area of influence of our well fields,” he said of the municipal water supply of drinking water to thousands of city residents and dozens of businesses.\nMr. Dopson echoed the comments of many others who spoke during the hearing when he stressed his “real concerns” about the Floridan Aquifer and how the underground water supply might be adversely impacted by the mining operations.\n“We want to be very protective of our water supply,” Mr. Dopson said. “They (mining companies) want to make money, and there’s nothing wrong with making money. But are they making money at the expense of the rest of the county?”\nThe city pumps about 1 million gallons of water per day and distributes it to residential and commercial customers. As the city grows in the decades ahead, Mr. Dopson said, it wants to be able to continue meeting the drinking water needs of its citizens.\nManager Dopson then read a prepared statement into the record:\n“The special exceptions, if granted, should be issued for a maximum of … two years subject to the facilities providing site specific lithological and hydro geologic data including aquifer performance testing for review.\n“The special exception should also include specific language allowing the county to terminate the special exception in the event that mining operations result in adverse impacts to the city’s well fields and other existing infrastructure or the environment.”\nWyman Duggan, a Jacksonville attorney representing Old Castle Southern Group, said engineering models indicate the mining operation after 20 years would only cause a “total drawdown of one-third of an inch” at the nearest city well about 2.5 miles away.\nHe further said sand mining has been done successfully for many years with no problems and did not anticipate any problems here.\n“Sand mining is well established in Florida,” Mr. Duggan said. “It’s not a new industry. Mining and mineral extraction are encouraged by your (county) comprehensive plan. Mining is not new to the county and not new to this property.”\nIndeed, DuPont has been mining on hundreds of acres in the southeastern portion of Baker County for many years. Describing Old Castle’s request for a special zoning exception as a “housekeeping matter,” Mr. Duggan said it should be approved as a routine measure.\n“Mining and mineral extraction are encouraged by your (county) comprehensive plan,” he told commissioners.\nMr. Duggan asked commissioners to not be swayed by the emotional arguments critics made, but to consider the scientific evidence that shows no adverse impact on the environment from sand mining. He also pointed out that the company’s plans meet all the requirements needed in the county’s land development and zoning code to seek a special exception permit for a mine.\n“They’re speaking from the heart,” he said about the residents voicing their fears and concerns. “They care about their community. But you’re not here to do the will of the people. You’re here to apply the law.”\nIf the county approves the mining proposals they will be contingent on the owners’ obtaining permits from federal and state agencies, including the US Army Corps of Engineers, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Florida Wildlife Commission and St. Johns River Water Management District, which controls water withdrawals.\nThe water management district is presently reviewing the mining plans and is expected to release its findings in the next couple of months. Without the agency‘s approval, the mining plans would go no further.\n“This boils down to whether we can trust the water management district to do their job,” Commissioner Adam Giddens said. “I’d like to think we can.”\nCommissioner Mark Hartley, however, expressed concerns about how the proposed mining operations might affect nearby wetlands and the Floridan Aquifer. He said he didn’t see an upside to the equation.\n“I don’t think it can have a positive effect on the county,” Mr. Hartley said.\nA few minutes later he made a motion to deny the mining petition and after a pause of several seconds Commissioner Giddens seconded the motion. But when Chairman Gordon Crews called for a vote, Mr. Hartley was the only one who voted in favor of his own motion, which failed 4-1.\nShortly afterward, commissioners voted to continue the hearing on August 20, or possibly earlier if the water management district renders its decision before then.\nMeanwhile, mining company officials agreed to pay for the county to hire an independent hydro geologist to review the plans and render an unbiased opinion as to whether the scientific data furnished by the applicants is accurate and reliable.\n|Last Updated on Friday, 20 July 2012 12:48|", "id": "<urn:uuid:88de962a-7522-4852-8aff-bd60e40da76d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bakercountypress.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2023:commissioners-put-off-decision-on-sand-mines&catid=59:news&Itemid=57", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9625548720359802, "token_count": 2143, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Fisheries regulators voted Wednesday to reduce by more than one-third the harvest of menhaden, a small fish that plays a big ecological role in the health of the Chesapeake Bay and the fish that swim in its waters.\nMeeting in Boston, the menhaden board of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted to cut the annual harvest by 37 percent, according to calculations by the Pew Environmental Group. The new harvest limit, which is subject to a vote by the full commission in one year, would be effective in 2013.\nApproximately 460 million pounds of Atlantic menhaden were caught in 2010, primarily by trawlers that scoop up the fish in nets in the bay and along portions of the coast. Lobstermen in Maine and Massachusetts and bay crabbers also use the oily fish to bait their traps.\nEnvironmentalists, scientists and sports fishermen have lobbied for years for the more stringent catch limits. The forage species is eaten by prized game fish such as striped bass, or rock fish, and filters the Chesapeake Bay, improving its water quality.\n“They did the right thing today,” said Peter Baker of the Pew Group. “I think they heard the public loud and clear.”\nThe commission held 13 public hearings on menhaden and received nearly 92,000 comments, the vast majority seeking to limit the harvest. The reduced catch is intended to allow menhaden stocks to rebound.\nThe lower catch limit could be felt the hardest in Reedville, Va., home to a menhaden fleet that has made the tiny bay town the No. 2 fishing port by weight in the U.S. More than 400 million pounds of the menhaden were hauled in last year by Omega Protein Inc. trawlers.\nOmega processes the catch into Omega-3 capsules popular among Americans for the fish oil’s vaunted health benefits. It is also used in an array of food and commercial products, from feed for swine, poultry and cattle and to meal for fish farms.\nOmega spokesman Ben Landry said a new stock assessment was due within the next year. “There’ll be a lot of new data presented to the board over the next year and hopefully the population will improve,” he said.\nOmega, a Houston company that also operates a menhaden fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, employs about 300 people at its Reedville plant during the May-to-December season. The company has said limits could trigger job reductions.\n“I think we’re going to have to take a real close look at our current operations to see how it’s going to be affected,” Landry\nsaid, stopping short of saying there would be job cuts.\nMenhaden, pudgy fish that typically are less than 1-foot in length, have no value as a food fish. But the fish so coveted by Americans as a dietary supplement is also a primary source of nourishment for sea life and birds.\n“That same Omega-3 fatty acid is really important for fish that eat menhaden and the other animals that eat menhaden,” said Baker, director of Pew’s northeast fisheries. “It’s the most nutritious food that they can eat.”\nScientists have linked lower weights in stripers to declines in menhaden.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation called the vote a victory for the coastal ecosystem and the fish that feast on menhaden.\n“This is great news for jobs, for our economy and for a society that values wildlife,” said Will Baker, president of the\nMaryland Gov. Martin O’Malley praised fisheries regulators for their actions.\n“The new, more conservative fishing threshold and target are significant steps in ensuring a sustainable future for menhaden, an essential food source for striped bass, bluefish, dolphins, osprey and bald eagles and other fish and wildlife species,” he said in a statement.\nVast schools of menhaden used to range from Maine to Florida, supporting a thriving fishery along the coast. Omega is the last so-called “reduction” fishery along the Atlantic.\n“The abundance of menhaden and the number of menhaden in the water, over the last 30 years, has been reduced by more than 80 percent,” Baker said. He called the vote a “watershed moment.”\n(Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press.

{"text": "Sometimes, we at the Band know that part of owning who you are is admitting it to the world. It's one reason why we at The Band work tirelessly to break down stigmas and find the ties that connect us all, the ties that remind us that we are none of us alone.\nPlease join us in standing tall and proud as we tell the world who we are.\nWhat are you, The Band, The Face Of?\nI am fairly open, I am aware that the only way people are going to understand various things is to have people speak out about them to be the face of them.\nI am fine being the face of things; I proudly wear my labels as an ACOA, rape/incest survivor, special needs parent, non-traditional student, and self-injurer. But, I have spent years hiding, pretty well denying, a label that I should be wearing. It's a label that gives me butterflies as I sit here getting ready to type it.\nI am, in no uncertain terms, an addict. Yet, when asked what I am the face of or talking about me and my past I never use that term. In fact, I often comment on how my family has history (a strong history of) addiction, I just fail to mention I am part of that history.\nBut, I can't hide it any longer. And I am not even sure why I hide it; I mean I know why, I am scared of what people will think and say. But, why? I am not ashamed or worried about anything else in my past, though a lot of the dumb things I chose to do occurred or were a result of not being sober.\nI spent much of my youth from about 14-15 using pain medication and alcohol. I mean pain medication was easy to get because I was an active kid who was prone to injury. I often went to the doc for an injury and they would write me a script. While I took them \"as prescribed\" I would take them too long when I actually no longer needed them.\nI would find a way to get different medication so I could \"alternate\" and maintain the high longer. I would toss in alcohol when I could because my parents were open about alcohol, that it wasn't taboo. My parents didn't know about a lot of the drinking that occurred nor the extent to which it happened.\nIt made me numb, I made dumb decisions on it. I hurt myself and others, but I still doubt that many people of my youth realize what I was doing. After all most addicts are good at manipulating the situation.\nYet, still this label has been one I denied and disowned which in the long run did as much harm to me and my psyche as if I had denied my own left arm. Because this label, being an addict, is as much a part of me as my left arm.\nWhat baffles me is when a friend slips or enters recovery I am the first to be there. Never saying a word about my issues, I offer to go to meetings and have a \"safe space\" at my home. All the while biting my tongue and not finding the camaraderie I could have, should have.\nSo, what brought me to the point of revealing this layer? Well, I slipped and fell HARD this week. We have been having lots of struggles, mostly financial, and this isn't an excuse just a telling of the events. I ran out of coping skills, ultimately that is what happened, I ran out of fucking coping skills.\nI started popping again, finding a way to take the pain medication every hour. Never letting my feet touch the ground, so to speak, for about a week. I would pull into work and start calculating when I could leave and get home to take another pill. I would take a pill and immediately look at the clock and figure out when I could take another. This whole time rationalizing that I was \"taking it as prescribed.\" Technically I wasn't taking any more pills than what the bottle said, never mind I wasn't in pain.\nI finally told hubby two nights ago that I snuck a pill in yesterday morning, then he made them disappear (honestly, I wasn't here so I have no idea about the disappearance--other than I asked him to get them someplace I don't know of) and bought me pomegranate juice, which I love. I still have been holding close to my secret.\nUltimately I chose to peel open this layer because I can no longer be silent, because the silence is killing me. It's allowing my illness to fester and then allows it to be fed. And I know that's not okay. I need a support network more now then ever, one that I know \"in person\" doesn't exist but one that I know I have here \"online\" and far away.\nI know many of my friends will recoil, wondering how it could be. I don't know how or why, I just know it is. I just know I can't go on denying such a huge part of me. I need to find the fellowship, I need to be able to reach out when I am falling down that black hole. I need help figuring out what this means for me, my life, and how this slip is going to color my world from now on.\nI have a friend with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).\nMy mom has it too.\nRA is an invisible illness. People with invisible illnesses have no visible symptoms, so many folks don't understand why they can't do all the things that most people can do. There is some sort of spoon theory that they use to try to explain it; long story short, people with these invisible illnesses only have so many spoons to get through each day. They have to think about how they are going to use each spoon because they can't go get more spoons at the spoon store, and I can't give my mom or my friend some of my spoons to get through the day.\nI found out my friend was thinking of a project involving spoons; she's real crafty and creative like that. I made it my mission in life to go find my friend lots of random spoons. I went to the local flea market hoping to find some spoons. I found a bunch of random spoons and bought lots of them for my friend's project. This made me happy.\nThen, I got sad. I was sad because I can't give my friend any of my metaphysical spoons, even though I often have more than I need to get through my day. I would gladly give up some of my spoons for my friend or my mom, but I can't. That isn't how spoon theory works. Maybe some day, science will have the answer to that conundrum, but right now that is still \"fringe science\"; I get enough fringe science from my Sunshine, as he studies the neurophysiology of addiction.\nI sat and thought about spoons, and I was sad that I can't give my spoons to those who need them. Then I had a moment of extreme giddiness over the saying we have in recovery about how \"spoons are for stirring coffee.\" This is especially funny to addicts, because we have some insane uses for spoons.\nThen I remembered that movie The Matrix. There is no spoon. This has the potential to take me down the paths of fringe science, but I get enough of that from Sunshine.\nSo rather than be sad about not being able to share my metaphysical spoons, or travel down the path of fringe science, I went shopping.\nI went to an antique shop, and I bought some spoons. I bought some really neat, rather fancy, really random spoons. They are my gift to my friend.\nSee, I sat in a meeting last night with other recovering addicts, and I realized that the fellowship is all about the therapeutic value of one addict helping another. We addicts share our experience, strength, and hope with one another. We share our metaphysical spoons.\nWhile I may not have an invisible illness that leaves me debilitated on some days, I do have a disease that can't exactly be seen. The treatment for my disease involves sitting around with other recovering addicts and sharing our spoons with one another.\nWhile it may not help my friend get through her day better (physically) for me to send her some fancy antique spoons, I know that it will make her heart smile, and that's what helps her get through the bad days - just like another addict's experience, strength, and hope helped me get clean.\nToday, y'all are part of my circle of recovery. Y'all share y'all's spoons with me, and that's some awesome shit.\nAnd until fringe science catches up with us, we'll keep stumbling along the best we can. And I'll keep buying up random spoons for my friend.\nI spent a lot of years in active addiction, wearing yesterday's clothes and grime. When I first got clean, I did a lot of dressing up so that the outside looked good, in hopes that you wouldn't see past the facade to realize that the inside was a fucked-up, shitty mess.\nToday my outside is more of a reflection of what's going on inside. I feel whole, I feel worthwhile, and I feel good, therefore I try to look good.\nThere's something to be said about the feel of a well-made cashmere sweater or pair of silk sweatpants, or even an uber-comfortable cotton t-shirt that fits like it was made for me. There's just something nice about wearing fancy pants and fancy shoes to go grocery shopping. I lived too long in the filth and desperation of addiction to deny myself some little luxuries today.\nNow, looking good doesn't have to be expensive. Yes, I wear a lot of high-end brands because I'm worth it, but here's a secret--I never pay full price. There is something thrilling about finding a pair of Armani pants on a clearance rack for $25 (yes, it happens). Must be endorphins, because it's quite pleasant like a good buzz.\nWell, today I am riding one serious endorphin-based high. I got new shoes. Not just any new shoes. Jimmy Choo shoes. Nude patent leather sandals on cork platform wedges. Brand New In Box. For $85. And? They feel really good on my feet--great arch support, heel and ball of foot cushioning, and light as feathers. My first pair of Jimmy Choo shoes!\nTell me that's not a dose of happy.\nHere at The Band, we believe in kicking stigmas to the curb, flinging glitter, and shining a light into the dark. And now?\nYour bandmate needs a sounding board.\nIt's time to Ask The Band!\nI quit drinking seven months ago.\nActually, it was 217 days ago if you want to get specific.\nI wasn't a fall down drunk all the time. I reserved my drinking for the evenings and the weekends. I usually waited until my child was in bed. I usually drank with other people.\nI graduated both high school and college with honors, all while drinking. People knew I attended classes hungover but no one ever said I had a problem. I have successfully held down jobs all while drinking. I had more than my fair share of liquid lunches and still managed to not get fired. My happy hours after work went on too long and by sheer luck I never hurt myself or someone else or had a run in with the law.\nI stopped drinking when I found out I was pregnant. As soon as I was done nursing I started drinking again. I was sober for about a year. Aside of that year, I hadn't been sober that long since I was 14 years old.\nLast summer, I made a complete ass of myself with my drinking.\nI took risks I shouldn't have. I drank alone often. Most mornings I'd think about how long it would be until I could drink again. I'd wonder if I could drink during the day and be okay to pick my son up from day care. I came dangerously close to drinking at lunch. I arranged sitters so that I could drink to excess and not have to worry about parenting getting in the way.\nI started to scare myself.\nI thought about drinking and wanted to be drunk all the time. The only thing that stopped me is the shame of everyone finding out that I'm an alcoholic. I can barely type those words; I have yet to say them out loud to anyone. But it is who I am and it was getting really hard to keep hiding it.\nSo I quit drinking. Cold turkey. Just like that.\nBut I miss it.\nI miss being drunk. I don't know if I can do this for the rest of my life. I want to drink so badly tonight it hurts.\nI don't know how to live sober.\nI'm afraid to tell people just how bad my drinking was because they will think I'm a bad mother, a bad person. Or they won't believe me because I seem put together. Or I'll be held accountable and be judged if I slip.\nAnd I really, really feel like I'm going to slip.\nI thought I'd be less scared of myself if I got sober.\nWhy am I still so scared?\nWhen is this going to get easier?\nAlcoholism can completely change a loved one's personality and put stress on the entire family as a result.\nThis is her story.\nLife's not fair, I know that. I don't expect fairness from the world at large. But I feel like - and maybe this is me being a spoiled only child - we should try to be fair to those we supposedly love.\nHe's an alcoholic, I know that too. He tells me so all the time, whenever I complain about his behavior or his attitude. Or whenever he feels bad. He's trying to fight his demons, he says.\nBut I'm angry. I'm supposed to be the bigger person and I am so fucking angry.\nWe made a decision about today's schedule last night. Last night when he was perfectly sober, I must add. Today I followed that schedule and it turns out he is mad that I did. He feels like I left him out, even though that's what we decided last night.\nBut I'm the bitch. I'm starting the fight, because I wanted to know why he'd called me so angry. He is mad that his family wasn't there when he woke up.\nThe decision wasn't even 12 hours old, but he changed his mind and is resentful that I didn't know that, that I didn't follow his new wishes.\nI fucking hate that. I hate not being able to make plans, not even 12 hours in advance, because he doesn't know what kind of mood he'll be in. He might change his mind and he will be a resentful fucking child if he's committed to something and then changed his mind about it. Or he'll be mad at us if we've gone somewhere without him, because he told me he wanted to sleep late.\nI don't feel like I have a partner, I feel like I'm being bossed around by a petulant child.\nI know that he is hurting. I know that he is trying to get better. I know that in a few hours, he will be my real husband for a while - the one who doesn't act like a petulant child. But then nighttime will come, he will have his five drinks after the kids go to bed - and he will be perfectly nice at that time too - and then in the morning he will be an asshole.\nIt's like I live with two people and one of them is a total dick. We can't afford counseling, rehab, or to live apart, really. I don't even know what's actually wrong with us. Are other men so resentful if they don't get to wake up whenever they choose? I know he has insomnia, which is his reason for drinking, but it just seems weird for someone in his thirties.\nHe gets resentful if I'm not available for sex whenever he wakes up, but he's also resentful if I wake him up early to have sex before I have stuff to do. He's resentful whenever I'm on the computer, but that's a big source of our income right now.\nIt's like he doesn't know how to be a grownup anymore.\nPage 1 of 24", "id": "<urn:uuid:2a5d2ff4-06c7-4cc2-968a-3a7a8031ed9b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bandbacktogether.com/category/addiction/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:49:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9845542311668396, "token_count": 3469, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "HOWLAND, Maine — Foxcroft Academy crowned eight individual champions to pull away to victory Saturday at the Eastern Maine Class C wrestling championships held at Penobscot Valley High School.\nThe defending state champion Ponies totaled 249.5 points to best runner-up Dexter (195). Fort Kent was third with 85.5 points, with Mattanawcook Academy of Lincoln (69) and Piscataquis of Guilford (60) rounding out the top five.\nFoxcroft qualified wrestlers in all 14 weight classes for next Saturday’s state championship meet to be held at Fryeburg Academy, while Dexter advanced 13 qualifiers.\nFoxcroft — which edged Dexter by a single point to win last week’s Penobscot Valley Conference meet — led Dexter by 23 points entering the championship finals, with the Ponies still having 11 wrestlers alive while the Tigers had 10.\n“It felt like a dual meet out there with all the Foxcroft wrestlers on one side and all the Dexter wrestlers on the other side,” said Foxcroft coach Luis Ayala, who teaches at Dexter. “Dexter and Foxcroft have always had a great rivalry, and you could really feel it out there. Every match was hard fought, and the crowd was going wild.”\nDexter immediately narrowed the gap with championship-match victories by Dylan Hanscom at 106 pounds, Tyler Salsbury at 113 and Aaron Webber at 126 — with two of those victories coming against opponents from Foxcroft.\nSix other head-to-head matchups remained, and Foxcroft won all of them.\nTrevor Weymouth (132), Forrest Law (138), Wesley Stinson (145), Corey Bjornson (182), Corbyn Bruce (195) and Alex Sedore (285) all won their individual regional titles by defeating Dexter rivals in the finals.\nTodd Francis (152) and Zac Smith (170) also won championships for the Ponies.\nFoxcroft got second-place efforts from Brooks Law (113), Isaac Whittemore (126) and Damien Small (220), thirds from Eli Olson (106) and Mark Smith (120) and a fourth from Dylan Bruce at 160.\nDexter crowned four champions in Hanscom, Salsbury, Webber and Jon Gudroe (160).\nRunners-up for the Tigers were Seth Blais (132), Andrew Adams (138), Andrew Levensalor (145), Anthony McLaughlin (182), Josh Haskell (195) and Kyle Lockhart (285), while Vincent Malinauskas (152) and Carl Snow (170) each placed third and Devan Gudroe (120) finished fourth.\nOther Eastern Maine champions were Sam Thomas of Piscataquis of Guilford and Zac Ragot of Washington Academy of East Machias. Thomas avenged a loss to WA’s Chris Weiss in their PVC final with a 6-5 victory in the 120-pound final, while Ragot won the 220-pound crown.\nFort Kent was led by second-place finishes from Joshua Pelletier (152) and Brandon Hartt (170).\nDirigo captures ‘C’ West\nAt Bucksport, Dirigo of Dixfield qualified 13 of its 14 wrestlers for the state meet, including four first-place finishers, to win the Western C regional for the first time in four years.\nDirigo scored 194.5 points to best host Bucksport, which amassed 157.5 points in its debut season as a Western Maine program. Another new Western C team, Winslow, finished third with 122 points, while Madison (100) and Mount View of Thorndike (82) rounded out the top five.\nCaleb Hall (132), Brett Whittemore (138), Jesse Hutchinson (145) and Gavin Sanders (182) all won individual titles for Dirigo, which also had four second-place finishers, two thirds and three fourths on the day.\nBucksport, coming off a third-place finish at last weekend’s PVC championships, had the most individual champions with six.\nFreshman Matthew Stewart was the 106-pound champion, while Jacob Stewart (152), Jordan Fogg (160), Nic Bishop (170), Chris Powell (195) and Damon Klinedinst (285) also won their weight classes for coach Larry Clement’s Golden Bucks.\nFive of the six Bucksport champions were top-seeded in their weight classes, while Bishop was a third seed in his return from a recent knee injury that had sidelined him for last week’s PVC meet.\nSenior Alex Brown, seeded second at 120 pounds, finished second in that weight class to give Bucksport a seventh qualifier for the state meet.\nMt.

Eaton, second in his weight class at last year’s state championship meet, won his second straight Eastern A title by pinning Cony’s Steven Morse at 1:39 of the final.\nThe Witches also got second-place finishes from Mark Smith (120 pounds), Anthony Sprigg (132) and Victor Irwin (195) and a fourth from Robbie Kiah at 145.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4010c256-2632-4a67-b656-71dbe6ccbd46>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2012/02/12/sports/wrestling/foxcroft-uses-depth-to-win-eastern-c-dirigo-prevails-in-western-c/?ref=relatedBox", "date": "2013-05-18T05:31:42Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9438833594322205, "token_count": 1179, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "AUGUSTA, Maine — The Maine Labor Relations Board on Wednesday dismissed the latest complaint filed by the state’s largest public employees union against Gov. Paul LePage’s administration related to bitter contract negotiations dating to last year.\nThe Maine State Employees Association filed the complaint Tuesday requesting that the LePage administration stop hiring private contractors to do work typically handled by the union.\nThe 16-page document alleges that the state is bound by contract to negotiate with the union before it hires nonmembers. The union said in its complaint that the practice deprives “bargaining unit members of that work, as well as the pay and benefits that come with that work.”\nMaine law requires the state to maintain the status quo after a contract expires, which is currently the case with the MSEA. That effectively means that the state can continue to contract out or reorganize its work force to make government more efficient and effective, according to the board.\nThe complaint was dismissed because it failed to state a valid claim under the State Employees Labor Relations Act.\n“Once again, the Maine Labor Relations Board has thrown out an unfounded complaint by this union,” John McGough, LePage’s chief of staff, said in a statement. “MSEA is desperate to find an issue to fight Governor LePage on, and this is another failed attempt to find one with any legal footing.”\nThe LePage administration and the MSEA, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, have been embroiled in contract negotiations that date to early last year.\nStill pending before the Maine Labor Relations Board is a complaint by the MSEA that the administration has acted in bad faith during negotiations, which still have not resulted in a new collective bargaining agreement.\nMSEA staff said in a statement Wednesday that the state board’s dismissal of the most recent complaint was expected but it should help expedite resolution of their pending complaint.\nLePage and some allies have targeted unions — both public sector and private sector — since the Republican governor has taken office.\nAlthough unsuccessful so far on measures that would prohibit unions from requiring dues to be collected from nonunion members, the administration has made some progress on labor issues.\nThe House and Senate recently approved a bill from the governor’s office that would strip the ability of independent child care providers to unionize and collectively bargain. Another bill that bans workers at the former Decoster Farm in Turner from unionizing also has won legislative approval.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "id": "<urn:uuid:eb20c8e0-a7e1-4fab-bc41-3582b3d97236>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2012/04/11/politics/maine-state-workers-union-files-complaint-against-lepage-administration/?ref=relatedBox", "date": "2013-05-18T06:31:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9638296365737915, "token_count": 520, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Effective leaders pay attention to structure and organization to insure the structure continues to benefit the organization’s mission. Read Deuteronomy 1:1-15.\nThe universe has overwhelming evidence of God’s use of structure and organization in the intelligent design of creation. Even the simplest living organism is more complex and subtle than the most sophisticated computer. The Bible gives insight into God’s instructions concerning structure and organization to Moses, the leader He chose to lead His people from a time of slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land. When carrying total responsibility for leadership of the people of Israel overwhelmed Moses, God encouraged him to change the organizational structure so as to channel more of Israel’s human resources to fulfill the leadership needs. Wisely Moses accepted God’s counsel.\nEffective leaders create structure that addresses the methods by which resources flow through the organization to accomplish work. Read Numbers 11:1-35.\nWhen Moses couldn’t handle all of the responsibilities of leading Israel, God told him to enlist seventy qualified persons, empower them and allow them to help to carry the burden. Moses was overwhelmed and the people under-served so God took action. The existing system wasn’t working so He changed it. It wasn’t about “who’s the boss”, it was about who would serve the people.\nStructure and organization has a way of turning chaos into an effective use of resources. Read 1 Corinthians 14:40.\nThis verse, in a chapter on worship structure, furnishes a valuable glimpse into the public worship of the first-century churches. It stresses that order, structure, form, unity, like mindedness and mutual regard should prevail when believers gather together.\nWell-led organizations can accomplish more than any individual can hope to accomplish. Read Exodus 18:1-27.\nMoses was overwhelmed by the problems of leading a large number of people. Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, helped Moses to see that organization and structure are essential to effective operation. Not only is work accomplished more efficiently, but people are better served and supported in doing the work.\nEffective Christian leaders make long range plans and give God room to actively direct or change those plans. Read Romans 15:22-29.\nIn today’s verses the Apostle Paul is in process of taking a love offering from the churches in Macedonia to the church in Jerusalem that had fallen on hard times. While on his way to Jerusalem, Paul is writing to the Christians in Rome discussing some long range plans to visit their church on his way to preach the Gospel in Spain.", "id": "<urn:uuid:880ce9cd-f102-40a9-95f5-ea5910c9717c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://barrywerner.com/author/dcone/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9549376368522644, "token_count": 537, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Nursing a critically ill state back to health\n|Indranill Basu Ray highlights the core problems that afflict Bengal's health sector and suggests a few ways to improve the situation|\nDespite many technological and other achievements that have propelled India from being a developing nation to one of the top economies of the world, one field that India continues to lag behind in is health. This is why stories of babies dying in large numbers haunt newspaper headlines. India is behind Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in life expectancy at birth or under-five mortality level. India accounts for about 17 per cent of the world population, but it contribute to a fifth of the world's share of diseases. A third of all diarrhoeal diseases in the world occurs in India. The country has the second largest number of HIV/AIDS cases after South Africa. It is home to one-fifth of the world's population afflicted with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nA common excuse that I often hear is that we have limited resources to tackle the huge and burgeoning health problems. But even the richest country on earth, the United States of America, has failed to provide appropriate health services to a large section of the populace. The problem in India is quite different. Apart from being a poor nation with limited resources, it also has a sizeable population in need of basic health services. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate sanitary measures and education ensures an ever increasing presence of communicable disease that have been controlled and even eradicated in the developed nations.\nIndia's list of woes does not stop here. Lack of foresight on the part of successive governments and selective and fragmented strategies to counter daily problems without a definite public health goal have been the mainstay of India's health policies. Resource allocation to this sector is influenced by the prevailing fiscal situation as well as by the priorities of the reigning government. Unfortunately, in Bengal — a state that faces a dismal fiscal situation — the government's priorities have been skewed as a result of political necessities. Although we have a new government at the helm, it is important to realize that gross changes at the practical level cannot be initiated without having a team with experience and knowledge define a well-thought-out strategy. It is also essential to have a government that is willing to fulfil the financial needs necessary for the strategy to work.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to paint a picture of the present state of public health in West Bengal and to suggest measures to rectify the same in a short article like this. My intention is to highlight the core problems plaguing the system and to suggest solutions based on accepted principles of public health and healthcare management. The steps that need to be taken are as follows: reducing disease burden, including infectious diseases as well as non-communicable epidemics like diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; restructuring the existing primary healthcare system to make it more accountable; creating a skilled and professional workforce which is quality driven; financial planning to bring more investment to the health sector.\nReducing disease burden is the cornerstone of any good health policy. The factors that help reduce communicable diseases are clean drinking water, improved sanitation and an effective vaccination programme. A paradigm shift, from the prevalent curative approach to a preventive approach, including health promotion by inculcating behavioural changes, is imperative to reduce disease burden. West Bengal is one of four states that urgently needs high investment in safe drinking water and toilet facilities. It is estimated that Rs 18,000 crore is required to provide effective drinking water and sanitation facilities for the entire country. Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Odisha would account for more than 60 per cent of the total outlay.\nSimilarly, a huge investment is required to provide nutritional supplements to malnourished children and pregnant and lactating mothers living below the poverty line. According to a report by the national commission on macroeconomics and health, West Bengal would need to harness an additional resource requirement of rupees (in crore) 1,286, 2,459, 4,693, 13,811 and 8,485 in sectors such as health, water and sanitation, nutrition, primary schooling and roads. It has been projected that in the next five years West Bengal will spend a large portion of its revenues on wages and salaries, interest payments and pensions, leaving very little for discretionary expenditure in the field of health. It is imperative that the present government rethink and strategize in collaboration with the Centre to ensure the appropriate funding necessary to make the state healthy.\nRestructuring the present healthcare delivery system is also equally important. Most primary healthcare centres are old, dilapidated buildings with few or no facilities. Some do not even have basic resources like healthcare workers or pharmacists. What is required is a radical overhaul of the existing system. There are differences in health systems of different countries. A State-run health system, such as the one in Canada, suffers from delayed medical care. A privately-run health system like the one in the US provides only limited health services to its poor. India's healthcare should carve out the best of both systems. Private healthcare is thriving in India. It is uncontrolled and aimed at profit-making. Government-run hospitals are poorly managed, providing few or no facilities to those living below the poverty line.\nDifferent models have been suggested to take care of this disparity. While private investment will always be geared towards profit-making, it is mandatory to rein in these bodies under well-defined rules. Large private hospitals in the US are non-profit bodies, which have to follow stringent rules in patient care. At the other end of the spectrum is the National Health Service in Britain in which small, medium and even a few large hospitals are making way for a more competent and accountable government-controlled health system with fewer hospitals.\nHuman resource management is very important in running an effective health system. One of the biggest lacunae of government health service is its poor human-resource management. Many physicians are not paid appropriate salaries or are posted in places that are not of their choice. Political intervention and favouritism play a big role in posting physicians. Consequently, dedicated physicians who want to serve the public or work in the academic setting found in government hospitals are forced to remain in private hospitals. To boost morale and efficacy, discipline needs to be instituted in the system and a transparent posting policy adopted. The doctor-population ratio needs to be improved by filling up vacancies in the West Bengal health service. It is important to free postings from the grip of bureaucrats to ensure the registration of quality candidates. Physicians failing to report to duty or indulging in indiscipline must be punished. Doctors who do sign up need to provide relevant and quality medical care. This can only be done if some form of recertification of doctors is made mandatory once every 10 years. Physicians' salaries in the state health service must be made on a par with those of the Central government to make sure that it remains a lucrative option. Senior physicians providing exemplary public service must be rewarded for the same. A commonly-held notion is that most physicians run after the lucrative salaries that are offered in private hospitals. Hence it is difficult to retain them in the government sector. This, however, is true of a minority. The majority of physicians are willing to work in a healthy, progressive and academic environment if there are appropriate non-financial incentives. Let us take the example of Christian Medical College, Vellore. Most of the faculty there are paid salaries that are much lower than those of the private sector. However, physicians are provided with other facilities such as good housing, free schools, free-to-highly-subsidized college education and, most importantly, a progressive and research oriented work environment.\nWest Bengal lags behind many other states when it comes to medical education. There is an urgent need to increase the number of medical colleges in the state. Private investment for the same should be welcomed but appropriate laws must be instituted so that huge capitation fees are not charged for seats. Furthermore, selection should be made through competitive examinations. A certain percentage of seats can be reserved for the economically weaker sections. Students passing out of such medical colleges must be given postings in rural hospitals. This has been true on paper for many decades now, but the rule has been poorly implemented even in government-run medical colleges.\nInnovative schemes ought to be thought of to involve the cash-rich private sector to service the medical needs of the state. Private institutions using government money or land must be asked to provide free service to 20 per cent of their capacity. Appropriate punitive measures — such as temporarily withholding or cancelling licences — can be taken when a private institution fails to honour this commitment. Institutions willing to set up large hospitals, particularly around Calcutta, must be helped through the provision of low-cost land. But in return, promises to set up satellite hospitals in far-flung district headquarters have to be met.\nThe biggest challenge to the rejuvenation of the healthcare system is the garnering of funds. West Bengal is financially broke, thanks to the misrule of the communists. Unlike most other communist rulers, our home-grown variants failed to provide basic sanitation, good roads, a working healthcare system and appropriate nutritional supplements to women and children. The lack of social services resulted in poor health and in increased mortality among the vulnerable sections of society. Government efforts to improve basic health services must fund programmes that provide sanitation, nutritional supplements, and daily meals for school-going children. Substantial investments in these sectors can reduce mortality in children. It is popular to blame doctors for not being able to save severely ill, malnourished children. But things won't change unless determined steps are taken to root out the problems, such as poor funds, minimal resources and an incompetent workforce, that affect the West Bengal health service.\nIn the next five years, in collaboration with the Centre and the non-government organizations involved in public health, the state government must chalk out a definitive strategy to improve the supply of clean drinking water, provide better sanitation and one full meal to school-going children and arrange for nutritional supplements to pregnant women. Private investment should be wooed in the health sector to set up hospitals in large metropolitan areas as well as in small district towns. While government land is needed at an appropriate price to help investors build hospitals, steps must be taken to bring about the inclusion of the deprived sections in their service plans. Strong regulatory bodies that can monitor private hospitals and nursing homes must be instituted. Many of the profiteering health institutions do not provide basic facilities, lack trained nurses and paramedical staff, and some are even run by quacks without medical degrees. It is of utmost importance that a regulatory body conducts surprise checks on these institutions, registers complaints and takes remedial steps.\nMany NGOs have been able to set up large projects benefiting thousands of people. They have also succeeded in bringing foreign aid to tackle malaria and HIV. The state government should help these NGOs achieve their goals while exercising control to prevent financial irregularities. Their services ought to be applauded and single-window processing of applications instituted to help them tackle bureaucratic delays. Health is a service industry and not a lucrative business. Unfortunately, in Bengal, most large hospitals are owned by corporates. Only a few are owned or run by doctors. There is thus a sustained effort to make profit. Poor consumer protection makes the man on the street vulnerable to substandard service at high prices.\nThese are trying times for Bengal, after years of mismanagement in the health sector. It is important for the present rulers to rectify the situation by laying down the stepping stones for a better tomorrow.\nTuesday, November 22, 2011\nNursing a critically ill state back to health Indranill Basu Ray highlights the core problems that afflict Bengal’s health sector and suggests a few ways to improve the situation", "id": "<urn:uuid:a51737a0-6a1a-4721-a739-791f50bfecba>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://basantipurtimes.blogspot.com/2011/11/nursing-critically-ill-state-back-to.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:08:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9593021273612976, "token_count": 2399, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Do you?\nToday Paul O'Neill, David Cone, Scott Brosius, Jeff Nelson, Jennifer Steinbrenner Swindal, and nearly 60 local high school kids helped move home plate, the pitchers mound, along with some dirt, from the old Yankee Stadium to the new stadium. Here's more from MLB.com:\nPaul O'Neill strode down a flight of concourse stairs at the new Yankee Stadium on Saturday, set his feet on the warning track -- a rough, dirt expanse, still studded with rocks and a few small puddles -- and took an exhaustive look around.\n\"Look at this joint, huh?\" he said.\nOut before him lay a baseball field, albeit an incomplete one, properly proportioned to match the dimensions of the old Yankee Stadium. Sod, with seams still showing, filled much of the area, and a large blue sign shouted the words \"YANKEE STADIUM\" from above center field. Waves of dark blue seats down the left-field line dumped into a still-unfinished section behind home plate, where metal supports hinted at where more seats are still to come.\nAnd on the mound, roughly 60 area children helped cram some dirt from the old Yankee Stadium into the new one.\n\"You know that the Yankees are going to do everything in a first-class manner, and this is a pretty impressive place,\" said former third baseman Scott Brosius. \"It's kind of cool to see it now, and it will be really cool to see it when it's all completed and ready to go.\"\nThat, of course, coming from a man who had already soaked in some of the best of what the old Yankee Stadium had to offer. So imagine how the children of local youth groups in the Bronx felt when the Yankees invited them to a symbolic ceremony on Saturday to transfer home plate, the pitching rubber and buckets of dirt from the old Yankee Stadium to the new one.\nBrosius, O'Neill, David Cone and Jeff Nelson joined members of Youth Force 2020 and the ACE Mentor Program in the ceremony, using shovels to dig up dirt and then set it back down across the street -- all in the midst of a driving rain.\n\"It means a lot,\" Cone said. \"It's a great symbolic gesture to be able to take the actual home plate and pitcher's rubber from the old Yankee Stadium and bring it over here. It was a great gesture, and to actually get kids in the Bronx involved with it, I thought was a really good thing to do.\"\nCone, like Brosius, spent a fair amount of time gazing up at the new stadium, which at once looks quite similar to and strikingly different from the old one. Set to open when the new baseball season begins in April, the structure has been rising up in the shadow of its predecessor for more than two years.\n\"There's a little twinge of jealousy, that's for sure, when you see this facility and how beautiful it's going to be,\" Cone said. \"But then again, I was at the right place at the right time.\"\n\"This new Yankee Stadium has got a lot to live up to,\" Cone said, lounging in a concrete lean-to that will soon become the home dugout. \"There are so many great memories, so many championships across the street, that anything you can bring over here -- any sort of memories you can bring with you -- it's a good thing to do to get this place off to the right start.\"And here are some pictures of the ceremony from MLB.com:\nTorre said he had been invited by the Yankees to a Saturday event at which Bronx high schoolers and a few members of the '98 team will transfer dirt from the home plate area at the old Yankee Stadium to the new Yankee Stadium. He's not going to make it due to a scheduling conflict with a brunch for his foundation, but it seemed like an olive branch of sorts.Nice of the Yanks to at least invite Torre to help with the ceremony, and like O'Brien says, it does seem like an olive branch. It's a shame he couldn't make it.\nThe third position presented in this year's Probabilistic Model of Range study belongs to centerfielders.

But the fact that Sabathia picked Jeter's brain should give the Yankees hope of landing the ace lefty.\n\"He's asked questions, yeah, about it,\" said Jeter, who got to know Sabathia as an opponent and All-Star Game teammate. \"I'll leave it at that.\n\"I'm not trying to sell anyone on New York. I don't think you have to sell people on playing in this organization. People have questions, but it's not like I have a sales pitch.\"Tim Dierkes of MLBTradeRumors.com told SNY.tv today that Sabathia will likely been signed quickly, and could be the first big name to be signed.

{"text": "When games slow and defenses tighten, grabbing offensive rebounds and making putbacks would seem to be a logical way to score, anyway. The data--albeit, extremely limited data--supports that theory.\nBased on Synergy's information about scoring immediately after offensive rebounds, there was no statistically significant correlation between percentage of misses converted into putbacks and Offensive Rating last regular season.\nThere was, however, a positive, statistically significant correlation between percentage of misses converted into putbacks and Offensive Rating* in the playoffs.\n*Because the quality of the defenses a team faces in the playoffs varies so much, I adjusted Offensive Rating. I determined a team's expected Offensive Rating by averaging its regular-season Offensive Rating with its opponents' regular-season Defensive Rating (weighted by number of games against each opponent). I subtracted the expected Offensive Rating from a team's actual playoff Offensive Rating.\nThat said, here's a huge caveat--those putback numbers are still from the regular season, because Synergy doesn't provide full data for the playoffs.\nDo teams that put back a large portion of their misses in the regular season continue to do so in the playoffs, and vice versa? I don't know.\nIt's important to note the importance of using putback data rather than relying on offensive-rebounding numbers to draw a similar conclusion. When a team grabs an offensive rebound and doesn't immediately shoot again, it faces a similar defensive challenge as it did for its first shot.\nLike I wrote above, logically, putbacks would increase in value when scoring in other ways becomes more difficult. As an expanded focus in advanced stats makes more numbers available in the mainstream, we'll learn whether the results match the logic. For now, consider this nothing more than a working theory.\nIf accurate, let's look at what the theory indicates about this year's playoffs.\nTeams in the upper two quadrants have above-average Offensive Ratings, and teams in the lower two quadrants have below-average Offensive Ratings. Teams in the right two quadrants convert an above average number of their misses into putbacks (indicating increased offensive success in the playoffs), and teams in the left two quadrants convert a below average number of their misses into putbacks (indicating decreased offensive success in the playoffs).\nI included teams that most likely will not make the playoffs, so you can see which teams' offenses might fit best in the playoffs if they improve overall in coming seasons (and keep the same style).", "id": "<urn:uuid:fe55c558-77b5-4c25-b4c2-416553e76eba>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=1563", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:48Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9568525552749634, "token_count": 508, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Of the six hitters who began Saturday tied for the most strikeouts in the National League, only one seems like he does not belong. Cameron Maybin and Jordan Schafer are both talented rookies getting acclimated to major league pitching. Prince Fielder is a slugger who struck out 135 times last season. Lance Berkman was bothered early by shoulder soreness. Mark Reynolds set a single-season record in 2008 by striking out 204 times.\nThat leaves David Wright, who has 19 strikeouts in 63 at-bats (73 plate appearances) this season – or one every 3.84 times up. Since 2006, Wright has gradually struck out less often – once every 5.85 plate appearances in 2006 to 6.18 in 2007 to 6.24 in 2008. But Manager Jerry Manuel and the hitting coach Howard Johnson have noticed that Wright has not looked quite right at the plate. Manuel said that Wright’s swing had gotten long and that he was “traveling” – or drifting – into the pitch rather than standing back and hitting it.\n“That’s an adjustment I think he can make because he’s done it before,” Manuel said. “In his best years, it didn’t look like he went anywhere, and there is the ball, right there. It’s almost – not quite – like Barry Bonds. David has to do the same thing.”\nWhenever Wright tends to scuffle, as he calls it, his hands tend to take a slow, circuitous path during his swing. With a longer swing, he is vulnerable to outside pitches, and he has struck out looking at his fair share. When Wright was off to a slow start in April 2007, Keith Hernandez told me that “a pitch on the outside corner is a pitch that most hitters love, but whenever anyone slumps, it looks like it’s third down and 40. It’s so far away.”\nBefore Saturday’s game against the Nationals, Manuel said: “It’s difficult to get to that pitch if you’re traveling, if you know what I’m saying. You can’t put a good swing on it.”\nStill, Wright began the day batting .302, so it is not as if he is at the Mendoza Line or anything, which Manuel has also noticed.\n“Right now, he’s just moving slightly,” Manuel said. “That’s hitting. That’s part of the art of hitting. And the thing about it, he’s still somewhat surviving. Shows just how good he can really be.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:bc577807-9180-4a79-a260-43c5a8212a33>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/david-wright-and-the-case-of-the-frequent-strikeout/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:22:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9739067554473877, "token_count": 556, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Harry Jerome Awards\nOn October 21, 1982, a meeting was held where a decision was made to form an association and a steering committee including Al Hamilton, publisher of Contrast Newspaper, Denham Jolly and Bromley Armstrong. Incorporated in July 1983, the Black Business and Professional Association (BBPA) is a non-profit charitable organization that serves to address equity and opportunity for the Black community in business, employment, education and economic development. Following the October 1982 meeting, it was decided to honour the six Black Canadian athletes who excelled at that year’s Commonwealth Games: Angela Taylor-Issanjenko, Ben Johnson, Mark McKoy, Milt Ottey, Tony Sharpe and Desai Williams.\nA dinner was suggested at which Harry Jerome, Canada’s premiere track and field athlete of the 1960s would be invited to be the keynote speaker. However, before he could be invited, Harry Jerome died suddenly in December 1982. The group then decided to turn the celebration into a tribute to Harry Jerome and an awards ceremony to honour the six athletes. The name “Harry Jerome Awards” was proposed by Hamlin Grange and so the first Harry Jerome Awards was held on March 5, 1983.\nThe Harry Jerome Awards is now a national event that recognizes and honours excellence in African Canadian achievement. In addition to the Harry Jerome Awards, the BBPA sponsors the Harry Jerome Scholarship Fund, providing financial support to African Canadian youth pursuing higher education. The idea for the Harry Jerome Scholarship Fund was provided by Hamlin Grange and realized through the efforts of Kamala-Jean Gopie, Pamela Appelt, Sheila Simpson and Beverly Mascoll. Journalist Cynthia Reyes was the BBPA’s president at the time. Under the leadership of Verlyn Francis, in 1996 the scholarship fund established an endowment fund and attracted corporate sponsorship. Today the Fund awards some thirty scholarships each year.\nFor more information, please visit our website at The Harry Jerome Awards Website", "id": "<urn:uuid:62035076-4164-4413-ab2e-fad2a86c461d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bbpa.org/events-programs/harry-jerome-awards/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:25:36Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9606969356536865, "token_count": 403, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

The word “heaps” is used in Australia when we say “lots”, such as lots of fun. Check him out in the Bird of Paradise plant in BB’s backyard!\nBB has been writing about his adventures and I hope you will visit her blog to find out all the details.\nPlease leave her a comment and let her know you visited. Here is the direct link to her blog.\nWhat do you think Pete should do while he is “down under”\nWhat season is it in Australia now?\nDo you think Bird of Paradise plants would grow in Seattle?\nWhy designate a month to picture books?\nDon’t we all love picture books already? The answer is simple. With the birth of eBooks, iPads, Kindles, Nooks and other online reading devices, many feel traditional printed picture books may be on the way out.\nThis is the 2nd annual celebration of Picture Book Month. Founder Dianne de Las Casa decided it was time to celebrate picture books in their printed format so she created an initiative to designate November as “Picture Book Month”.\nWe always celebrate picture books in our library. However, we have also added some art to the mix in our lessons. Here are the highlights of our week.\nWhat says Thanksgiving Day more than turkey, mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie?\nThe Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade!\nFor more than eighty-years, children young and old, have been delighted by the bobbing and swaying gigantic balloons that float down the streets of New York City in the parade.\nMelissa Sweet tells the true story of Tony Sarg, the puppeteer who was the inventor of the Macy’s parade balloons. After we read this book, some of the classes also made Balloons Over Broadway mini-boxes and finger puppets. You can get this activity and more at the Houghton-Mifflin website here.\nThanksgiving is a time to reflect and say thank you. While this book is not a traditional Thankgiving Day book talking about the Mayflower and pilgrims, it is a book about the importance of thanking friends for all the things they do for each of us.\nIn first grade, we used the Splat the Cat Activity Kit and added a fall leaf. Students wrote what they are thankful for during this holiday season.\nIf you want to read a funny chapter book to entertain you during the Thanksgiving holiday week, pick up a copy of Junie B., First Grader: Turkeys We Have Loved and Eaten (and Other Thankful Stuff). Find out how cranberry sauce in a can, exploding biscuits and rainbow sprinkles relate to Thankgiving and first graders. I guarantee this book will have you laughing in minutes!\nThe last book I want to include this week is Hello, Hello by Matthew Cordell. I think every family needs to add this book to their collection. In fact, Matthew has a blogpost listing 26 reasons why every family needs to read this book. You can read that post here.\nIt’s a story of what we really need to remember as we move forward into a very connected, very digital age.\nUsing simple text, charming watercolor illustrations, and animals in unusual places (flying fish and whales in the sky?), Cordell tells the story of Lydia, who helps her family remember that there is a time and place for electronics.\nFor a few minutes in the upcoming days, I hope you will set your gadget aside, and go outside to jump in those leaves and have some silly, crazy, outside fun!\nWhat is your favorite balloon in the Macy’s Day parade?\nWhat friend would you by thankful for this month?\nWhat gadget could you give up for a day?\nWe have a new President!\nYesterday the American voters re-elected Barack Obama to serve as our President for another four years. Our blog poll had the same results!\nIf you would like to read more about President Obama or his family, we have three biographies available in the library. They are located on the biography (921 OBA) shelf.\nGiven the chance to meet any of the First Family face to face, what question would you ask?\n(President Obama, Michelle Obama, Malia or Sasha)\nToday is Tuesday, November 6, 2012.\nIn the USA, that means it’s also our election day!\nEvery four years, voters have the opportunity to cast their ballot and vote for who they want to be president on our country. Registered voters choose the person who best matches their beliefs. They can either vote in person or by mail. In our area of Washington state, voters can only vote by mail. Voters receive a special ballot in the mail, fill it out and send it back.\nWe have two main candidates running for President of the United States. This year we have an incumbent, President Barack Obama, who is a democrat.The word incumbent in politics refers to the person who already holds this office.\nIf re-elected, President Obama will serve for another four years and then he will not be able to run again. We have a time limit of eight years as president in our country.\nPresident Obama is running against former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is a Republican. If Mr. Romney is elected, he will serve for four years and then have the chance to be re-elected in 2016.\nTo vote, you must be a US citizen, at least 18 years old and be a registered voter. You can watch a short Scholastic video here that explains more about the candidates and the election.\nA great book called, So You Want to Be President by Judith St. George describes the some of the lesser known facts about the men who have been our Presidents.\nFor example, did you know that six Presidents were named James? Or that Benjamin Harrison had eleven brothers and sisters?\nThis book is available in our library. It won the Caldecott award in 2001 for its illustrations by David Small. The call number is 973.09\nIf you want to keep up with the news of the election, you can visit most any of the news websites, such as CNN.\nWe will also have our own poll on our library blog. It will be open until midnight on election day. I wonder how our results will compare to the official results!\nDo you love to play dominoes? Do you enjoy the clink, clink, clink as dominoes topple in black and white lines? If so, pick up a copy of Toppling by Sally Murphy. Josa donated a copy for our library and wrote the following book review!\nJohn is the main character of this book. He is a boy with an unusual hobby–he likes to set up dominoes and tip th first one and watch them topple in complicated patterns. John’s goal is to win the world record of toppling. then something happens to make John’s world start to topple. His best friend Dominic gets very, very sick. This is a one-of-a-kind story about change, coping and friendship. This is a book for ages 8+ or anyone who wants a good read. It is illustrated very nicely.\nYou can find Toppling by Sally Murphy in the realistic section of our library!\nHere is the call number: F MUR Realistic\nHave you every played the game dominoes?\nWhat have you built using dominoes?\nSkyping! Skyping! I’m SO glad someone invented Skyping!\nToday Ms. Holder’s library class skyped with author Stephen McCranie. Stephen is the author of the Mal and Chad graphic novel series.\nInstead of having the author come to our school, we visited with him virtually.\nA few weeks ago Mrs. Hembree found out on Twitter that Stephen was offering to skype with teachers and librarians. She signed up and our school is one of over 70 schools Stephen will “virtually” visit this fall.\nDuring the call we watched him draw on his computer. First he taught us that comics are stories + pictures.\nThen to develop our own story, he had us answer two questions:\n- What does my character want?\n- What is preventing my character from getting what he or she wants?\nWe decided that our character, Tara, wanted to own a bakery, but her family wasn’t very supportive of that idea. She ran away, met a baker and learned how to become the baker she always wanted to be.\nAfter that we had a quick demonstration on how to draw a picture. We learned it’s easy if you use shapes like circles, squares or triangles. As Stephen drew on his computer, we tried to guess what famous characters he was drawing!\nIn the last portion of our visit, Stephen asked us to start a story. Then before our eyes, he drew a scene from our story.\nWhile he was drawing, he also answered our questions.\nWe found out that he has loved comics since he was about 5 years old. He drew his first comic strip for a school newspaper in college. He likes comics because they are a great way to express yourself. They are an artform with a lot of potential.\nHe reads lots and lots of books and really enjoys the Bone series by Jeff Smith. Stephen said he believes that creativity is like a muscle in your head. When you practice you get better over time. If you want to get better at drawing , you need to draw and practice every single day. The tools for drawing don’t really matter. Pencils, crayons, pens – use whatever you want and draw, draw, draw.\nWe will be sure to buy a few copies for the library! After about 30 minutes, our time was up! It was a great first Author Skype experience! Thank you Stephen for visiting the Bulldog Readers! If you are looking for Stephen’s books, here they are. We have both available for check out in the library. You can also link to his Mal and Chad website here.\nWhat do you think our story was about?\nHave you ever skyped with anyone? Do you like it?\nWhat is your favorite graphic novel or comic series?\nPete the Cat is a good friend of Mrs. Hembree. This weekend he came home with her so he wouldn’t be lonely sitting in the library all weekend.\nOn Saturday morning, Mrs. Hembree got up and walked into the dining room.\nWhat did she see?\nPete the Cat was stuffing himself into a really big envelope!\n“What are you doing Pete?” she asked. Pete started singing!\n“Where are you traveling to Pete? I see there are some letters on the envelope. Does that say Australia?” Mrs. Hembree asked Pete.\n“YES! Australia!” Pete exclaimed! “I’m going to Australia and I’m singing this song!”\n“Pete, won’t you be scared? Australia is a long way from Seattle! It’s not even in North America!” said Mrs. Hembree.\n“NO!” he shouted! “I won’t be scared! I’m going to see my friend and I’ll be singing my song!”\n“Tell me Pete, how did you decide to go to Australia? Do you know someone there?” asked Mrs. Hembree.\nPete said, “Do you know BB our Blogging Buddy? She asked me if I could come visit! So I decided since it started raining here, that I would visit her in Australia.\nDid you know Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere? When it’s fall here, it’s sunny and warm there because it’s springtime! I’m going to have fun and I’m going to be singing my song!”\n“Ok Pete. It sounds like you know what you want to do and who you want to see! Let’s go to the post office and get you on the road!” Mrs. Hembree said.\n“Thanks Mrs. Hembree! Don’t forget! I’m going to see BB and I’ll be singing my song!” Pete waved goodbye and was gone in a flash. She could hear in the background faint sounds of his song…..\nOh no! Australia is a long way from here!\nDo you think he will get lost?\nWill he have fun?\nWill he get back in time to go to Prague?\nLeave us a comment and let us know what you think!\nIt’s mid-October. The leaves are turning. The days are getting shorter and the nights colder. Are you looking for a new book? Check out what Angela drew for the library yesterday!\nMaybe you are thinking that it’s getting close to Halloween and you want a spooky book to thrill your reading time!\nSpooky stories are always popular with some students (not me – I get nightmares). This past weekend when I was in Yakima at Washington librarian conference I had the opportunity to listen to the author Royce Buckingham talk about his love of scary books and movies!\nRoyce shared how the movie Jaws was particularly scary when he was a kid! I remember seeing it too and I didn’t swim in the ocean for a month afterward! However, he loves scary monsters and books like that, which is why he now is both an attorney and a writer of spooky stories.\nDo you remember seeing the photos from when Hitu visited the Jaws set last summer and did a little reading in Jaws! This is the movie Royce is talking about! Yikes! That is a scary photo!\nIf you love this kind of book come in soon and check out the new books by Royce Buckingham.\nYou don’t have to like monsters to like all the new books in the library! Look at this selection available! From graphics to humor to fantasy or mystery we have something new for you!\nVisiting Yakima was a lot of fun! I had a chance to talk with lots of other librarians and share ideas with them. If you are a teacher librarian looking for a link to my slides, here you go!\nDo you like to read spooky stories?\nHave you seen Jaws at Universal Studios?\nWhat new book will you want to read?\nCongratulations and thank you everyone who made our annual bookfair a screaming success!\nAlso, between sales at the fair and sales online, we are at 103% of our\nfundraising goal! That means that I will be book shopping in the upcoming weeks for\nnew books to add to our library.\nThis is the stack I already purchased from the fair. If there is a book you absolutely must check out, leave me a reserve copy slip and I will get it to you as quickly as I can.\nMany, many thanks to our bookfair volunteers! Without their help, our fair would not have been such a great success! Here is our STAR CAST of volunteers!\nMr. Fornia’s kindergarten class also deserves a Super Special Shout-out! His class had the most online sales of any teacher at our school! Way to go Mr. Fornia’s class! Everyone is getting a SUPER STAR bookmark! Woo-hoo!\nWhen I named this post Thank You Near and Far, it’s because of our blogging friends thousands of miles away from here. I want to give a terrific thank you to BB and her mom AA in Australia! On Friday when I got home from school, I found this in my mailbox!\nInside was this…..\nI love my new Geelong Cats hat. This is an Australian “football” team. In the US, we call it “rugby” and in Australia, they call it football! Talk about confusing!\nSomehow BB found out that I love jewelry too, because she sent this beautiful bracelet.\nSomehow the words thank you don’t seem like enough for such a special package of gifts! The blogging friendship we have developed across the miles is dear to my heart. I hope someday we will meet in person! In the mean time, I have some new decorations in the library!\nAnd, last, but not least is a present I received from Penny! We have been reading Pete the Cat books and singing his songs in kindergarten. One morning Penny walked into the library before school started with this picture.\n“Do you know who this is?” she asked me.\n“It’s Pete the Cat and his SEVEN groovy buttons!” I replied.\nThank you Penny for taking the time to make this drawing! It’s hanging in a special spot on our library wall!\nWhat books or series do we need to add to the library?\nTell me about a special package you got in the mail!\nWhat should Pete the Cat do next?", "id": "<urn:uuid:3c6b2641-10ce-4765-a46c-793ab132959e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bellbulldogreaders.edublogs.org/author/juliehembree/page/4/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:01:53Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9609940648078918, "token_count": 4351, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "What Will “Post-Artifact Books” Mean For the Library?Posted: 14 Jun 2011\nThis is the post-artifact system. A system of unlocking. A system concerned with engagement. Sharing. Marginalia. Ownership. Community. And, of course, reading. - Craig Mod\nThis morning Craig Mod published another beautiful and thought-provoking essay called Post-Artifact Books and Publishing: Digital’s effect on how we produce, distribute and consume content. Like his other writings, this essay examines the future of the book vis-a-vis traditional and new publishing models. The essay addresses ideas about social reading, where and how books will live and the best format for digital books. All said, it is a sprawling but inclusive essay that, I think, all librarians need to read. Now.\nIn the opening Mod quotes Matthew Battles Library: An Unquiet History. After that little is expressly mentioned about libraries, forgivable since Mod, primarily a writer, publisher and designer, is not a librarian nor writing about what role they should play in shaping the future of books. However, the essay contains concepts that libraries are going to struggle with in the near future (if they are not already struggling with them now).\nA few questions:\nLibraries have always been somewhat social but what happens when the social is moved to the digital realm? How can libraries be a part of this. More importantly, how can libraries shape and connect this?\nMod points to several examples of how books are being created and published by alternative publishing formats largely through reader interaction. How can libraries be sure that these important books that are either POD or produced by smaller publishers are made available?\nWhat are libraries doing to help shape the new systems in which books and ideas will be distributed? Working for rather than reacting to (or against)?\nHow can libraries promote the de-emphasis of authority surrounding access to information and materials?", "id": "<urn:uuid:89f789e0-48ba-43f2-a3a8-8fdb2f5f9798>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://benjaminlainhart.com/2011/06/14/what-will-post-artifact-books-mean-for-the-library/?like=1&_wpnonce=9d779cb1c0", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9499785900115967, "token_count": 397, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Timothy Hart remembers being curious about local history even as a youngster growing up in Stafford.\n\"I grew up near an old railroad right-of-way, and I always wondered what had been there,\" said Hart, who graduated from Southern Regional in 1972. In those days, Ocean County was only beginning to feel the impact of the Garden State Parkway. And that right-of-way? That's where Route 72 is now, Hart said.\nHart's love of history has now landed him in a role he could only dream of: That of county historian for Ocean County. Hart, who serves as the director of the county's Cultural and Heritage Commission, was appointed county historian by the Ocean County Board of Freeholders on Wednesday afternoon.\nHart succeeds Pauline S. Miller, who has been the county's only historian previously. She died in December at age 93.\n\"His love for the history of this great county makes him the perfect choice for county historian,\" Freeholder John C. Bartlett said. \"Tim has extensive knowledge of the county's history. He is an expert when it comes to the role Barnegat Bay plays in county history, in addition to how historical events like the Civil War had an impact on this county.\"\nThe title carries no salary, but Hart said he is very happy to be chosen for the post.\n\"It's quite an honor,\" said Hart, who also serves as deputy director of the Tuckerton Seaport and Baymen's Museum in Little Egg Harbor.\nHart, who serves as Stafford Township's historian, has been a member of the Stafford Township Historical Society since his childhood. His Linked-in profile lists historical organization after historical organization, going back to high school. A theology major at Georgetown, he minored in history, while majoring in theology at Georgetown. He later attended law school and passed the bar in the early 2000s.\nHart not only studies history, however; he participates yearly in the reenactment of the battle at Cedar Bridge Tavern, site of an important Revolutionary War skirmish.\nHart said he does not see himself as the kind of historian Miller was.\n\"I don't know everything,\" he said, but instead he knows who to ask for the answers. That includes a vast wealth of town historians throughout Ocean County, whom Hart intends to get to know in the coming weeks and months.\n\"It's my fantasy to tour each of the towns with their historians and have them point out, 'This used to such-and-such,' \" Hart said.\n\"We live in such a homogenized society, with all the McDonald's and Walmarts and such,\" Hart said. \"When you know about the local history, it makes it kind of a special place.\"\nAnd that right-of-way that Hart grew up near? That's better known today as Route 72.", "id": "<urn:uuid:66fc8a1e-7ae4-4913-b8fd-5aa3149f6141>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://berkeley-nj.patch.com/articles/stafford-man-named-county-historian", "date": "2013-05-18T06:49:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9825831055641174, "token_count": 590, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "App for That\n“The purpose of this blog is to provide sourcing for texts quoted by @Horse_ebooks and, whenever possible, provide context,” wrote freelancer Jack Stuef on a freshly-minted Tumblr conceived in the bleary midnight hours early Friday morning. Born out of that insomniac haze is “The Annotated @Horse_ebooks,” a blog devoted to teasing out nuance and substance from the glorious fountain of non-sequitors that is the Internet’s favorite Twitter account, @Horse_ebooks.\n“The idea to do a Tumblr just came to me, but I had looked up some of Horse’s tweets before, and sometimes the sources of those can be just as bizarre and hilarious as the tweets themselves. Or they can be incredibly dull. I thought it was interesting,” Mr. Stuef, who frequently writes for The Onion and BuzzFeed, told Betabeat via Gchat.\nKickstart or Kill\nFor every snazzy hardware idea and genuinely inspiring artistic project, there’s also a whole lot of crap clogging up crowdfunding sites. This has not escaped the attention of the acerbic wits at the Onion News Network. And so the site’s latest video turns its knives on Kickstarter, dubbing it “an insidious new Internet scam,” roping people into donating to projects that are “in actuality, just terrible useless garbage.”\nDuring lunch on Mother’s Day, my own mom had some exciting news to announce: “I’m reading the best book!” she declared, taking a sip from her sweating water glass in the building May heat. “It’s called How To Be Black. It’s excellent–hilarious, but also serious,” she insisted.\nI had heard of it only in passing–on Twitter, and in scant Facebook posts. It was written by The Onion‘s Director of Digital and Internet Man About Town Baratunde Thurston, and had received almost five stars–a perfect score–from users on Amazon.\n“There were like 56 reviews last time I checked,” Mr. Thurston told Betabeat by phone this morning. “And I’m like, ‘Who’s the asshole that didn’t put five stars?’ Clearly it’s a five-star book.”\nEver since news broke last year that satirical news source The Onion was shutting down their New York office and heading to Chicago, The Atlantic reports that the core team of staffers has pursued every avenue to keep the company from heading west. One bizarre but apparently legitimate option was to have startup non-incubator Betaworks buy The Onion.\nIn college, this reporter once took a “new media” class where the professor let loose a terrifying edict: As homework, we would not be allowed to use any Google products for the entire week. That meant no Google search, no Gmail, no Gcal… nothing.\nThe experiment was supposed to teach us just how reliant we were upon one company for many of a college student’s basic needs, like learning, communicating and organizing.\nIt was not the darkest hour of this reporter’s life, but it was a very, very dark one.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2531fdd4-9156-4bbc-a58c-124e5f05a567>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://betabeat.com/tag/the-onion/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:56Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9567961096763611, "token_count": 705, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Food of the Gods from the Island of the Gods\nWe work directly with over 3,000 farmers farmers on the islands of Bali and Sumatra to procure our fine cacao.\nThe history of the Bali Cacao is linked to the history of the legendary Java Criollo, which is linked to the Philippines, which is directly linked to the cacao the Spanish brought there from the legendary Aztec cacao orchards of Soconusco, Mexico.\nThese genetics that made their way into Indonesia were dominantly planted on old Dutch plantations found on East Java. These same genetics that were so highly regarded were also planted on the next island over, Bali. As the chocolate industry become more industrialized in the mid 1900’s and production output replaced quality of flavor, the plantations started to replace the Java Criollo with hybrids that increased the volume of cacao per hectare.\nFortunately, the island of Bali was mostly ignored during the hybridization period. This is probably due to the fact that villages and small family farms populated these smaller islands, not plantations. In the mid 1900’s, Bali was nothing like it is today; it was still quite forgotten and remote. Today, many of Bali’s farms still remain as they were. The cacao is grown interspersed with other food crops such as, vanilla, exotic peppercorns, passion fruit, banana, jackfruit, palm trees and mangosteen. We refer to these as “food forests”.\nThe Health of it All\nCacao is PACKED with natural compounds called antioxidants. More than blueberries, pomegranate, cranberries and even red wine. Yet, all these fruits and drinks are great for a healthy diet and lifestyle.\nPromotes good cardiovascular health. Cacao is one of the best sources of natural magnesium, which is critical for a happy and healthy heart. Perhaps this is why its such a lovers food..\nPromotes good blood circulation. Theobromine is a superior vascodilator, which means more oxygen gets pumped into your bloodstream, making it a great food for exercise.\nLowers blood pressure.\nRich in minerals. Cacao is a seed which contains many vital minerals our body needs to function optimally.\nThere is so much more that we can go on for pages with the positive health benefits of cacao and chocolate.

{"text": "USE’s Sumo Carbon seatpost looks great with a smart carbon fibre weave post. USE’s own neat one-bolt clamp holds the saddle securely and doesn’t slip or creak.\nThe Sumo one-bolt clamp gives the seatpost its name. The head and clamp pieces are forged and CNC-machined from 7075 aluminium and take 7mm rails. Clamps are also available for fatter rails. Angle adjustments are laser etched on the clamp.\nUSE fits a 4mm Allen bolt so you need to be careful when tightening the clamp. We’d recommend using a torque wrench to avoid over-tightening it.\nThe head is bonded to a full carbon shaft with smart printed decals. Its 400mm length is generous and should mean it will fit a raft of bikes including very compact frames that need a lot of post to get the right saddle height. It’s available in the most common sizes 27.2, 30.9, 31.6 and 34.9mm.\nThere’s 10mm of layback but it’s a shame USE don’t offer an inline option for those that might not need that much layback.\nWe’ve been battering the seatpost through hundreds of miles including several long distance marathon races and the post has stood up just fine. The clamp has proved solid and reliable with no saddle slippage or readjustment necessary throughout the test period.\nThanks to the flex that you can build in with a carbon fibre shaft, t’s a comfortable post for long distance riding as well. That’s a unique advantage of carbon posts: try and make an aluminium post this flexible and it’ll fatigue to death in no time.\nIt’s a good looking seatpost too which matters for an item that is on such prominent show.\nWeight is good at 232g for our 30.8mm sample, which isn’t far off the claimed weight. It’s far from the troubling the lightest sub-200g posts but its durability and comfort won us over.\nA light, strong and comfortable British-designed seatpost.\nEasy clamp setup\nThere are cheaper carbon seatposts\nPrice (for 30.8mm): £89.99\nMore information: USE Sumo Carbon Seat Post\nWhat USE says about the Sumo Carbon seat post\nThe SUMO seat post is engineered to take a pounding and go the distance. The highly acclaimed, quick fitting, simple to adjust clamp design ensures the perfect saddle position. The SUMO is equally at home in Marathon events, TransMtn, Freeride (lite), as it is pounding out the cobbles in the heart of Europe.

{"text": "The Convention adjourned from July 26th to August 6th to allow the Committee of Detail – composed of John Rutledge of South Carolina, Edmund Randolph of Virginia, Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts, Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania – to prepare a rough draft of a constitution, based on the series of resolutions the delegates had debated, amended, and debated again. When the Convention re-convened, the Committee of Detail presented its report, made up of twenty-three articles. The Convention spent the remainder of August reviewing and further revising these articles.\nWe the People of…\nDelegates quickly agreed to accept the Committee of Detail’s preamble and Articles I and II, affirming the new government would be called the Unites States of America and consist of Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches. This agreement masked the critical issue that the Convention had debated throughout – was this to be a union of states or of people? The Committee of Detail’s constitution began, “We the people of the States (emphasis added) of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, do ordain, declare, and establish the following Constitution for the Government of Ourselves and our Posterity.” The Convention would not end with that language in the preamble.\nRepresentation: Who, What, and How Many?\nDiscussion of the Committee of Detail report continued to include the structure and powers of the legislative branch. Some of the key questions included: Who can elect representatives? How many representatives will there be? What will be their qualifications?\nDelegates debated whether to allow non-land owners to the right to vote for House members, or reserve the franchise to property owners. Gouverneur Morris wanted to restrict voting to those with property, considering them more educated and better able to choose wise leaders. “The ignorant and dependant,” Morris stated, “can be… little trusted with the public interest.” Colonel Mason countered arguments of this kind, saying all citizens should have equal voting rights and privileges. Doctor Franklin sided with Colonel Mason believing that restricting the right to vote to land owners would cause contention among the people. In the end Morris’s proposal to restrict the franchise to property owners was defeated soundly (7-1-1).\nJust as the Convention rejected a plan to restrict voting to property owners, they also rejected a proposal to restrict elective office to property owners. South Carolina’s Charles Pinckney moved that “the President of the U.S., the Judges, and members of the Legislature should be required to swear that they were respectively possessed of a cleared unencumbered Estate” – in an amount to be agreed upon by members of the Convention. This proposal went nowhere. Benjamin Franklin expressed his “dislike of every thing that tended to debase the spirit of the common people,” and observed that “some of the greatest rogues he was ever acquainted with, were the richest rogues.” Madison reports that Pinckney’s motion “was rejected by so general a no, that the States were not called.”\nThe Convention did have a sentiment in favor of strong citizenship requirements for legislators. The Committee of Detail’s report required members of the House be U.S. citizens for three years prior to election, and members of the Senate for four years. Some, including George Mason and Morris, agreed that a lengthy citizenship requirement would protect the legislature from foreign intrigue. Others, including Madison and Franklin, pointed to the number of foreign friends who had helped the states during the war for independence. Delegates sided with Mason and Morris, agreeing to requirements that members of the House be citizens for seven years and members of the Senate for nine years prior to election.\nOn the question of how many representatives would make up the national legislature, Article IV of the Committee of Detail Report stated that the House of Representatives would initially consist of sixty-five members, and that in the future, members of the House would be added “at the rate of one for every forty thousand.” Madison, expecting the Union to grow rapidly, thought that rate would quickly lead the House to grow too large. Others thought that time would make this issue irrelevant. Mr. Nathaniel Gorham from Massachusetts asked, “Can it be supposed that this vast country including the Western territory will 150 years hence remain one nation? Mr. Oliver Ellsworth observed that “If the government should continue so long, alterations may be made in the Constitution” through the amendment process. Delegates agreed to add the language “not exceeding” to the one representative for 40,000 citizen ratio, making that a ceiling and not a floor. Controversy over this provision would re-emerge before the end of the Convention, however.\nThe Specter of Slavery\nLikewise, controversy would emerge about slavery. Consideration of the apportionment of representatives raised the question of whether slaves would be included within that ratio. Morris rose on August 8 and gave a withering criticism of the institution. Moving to specify that this ratio would include only “free” inhabitants, Morris called slavery “a nefarious institution,” and “the curse of heaven”. Comparing free with slave states, Morris noted, on the one hand, “a rich and noble cultivation [which] marks the prosperity and happiness of the people,” and on the other “the misery and poverty which overspread the barren wastes of Virginia, Maryland, and the other states having slaves.” Morris’s motion was defeated 10-1, but the issue of how slavery would be addressed by the new union was by no means resolved.\nFor more detailed information on the Constitutional Convention, please visit Prof. Gordon Lloyd’s web companion to the Philadelphia Convention.\nPosted in Countdown to the Constitution", "id": "<urn:uuid:ea2a4a62-5765-4ec7-ba52-1a99029763a0>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://billofrightsinstitute.org/blog/2011/08/15/countdown-to-the-constitution-a-rough-draft-of-the-constitution/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:48Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9638350009918213, "token_count": 1246, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean"]}

Have you been listening?\nDenis Alexander on Understanding Creation Theology\nIn this video Conversation, Denis Alexander asserts that contemporary Christians are not taking the early chapters of Genesis seriously enough.\nEvolution, the Enlightenment, and Worldviews\nIn this video conversation, N.T. Wright discusses how the Enlightenment worldview -- which clearly separates God from the world -- has impacted our view of Scripture, and why cleaning the \"spectacles\" through which we view the world can help us see both Scripture and the world more clearly.\nRaising Children to Pursue Truth\nIn this video Conversation, Joel Hunter articulates the importance of raising a child that can garner knowledge from a variety of sources and to be able to study science with integrity—that is, to be able to pursue the truth to where it leads.\nWorshiping, Growing, and Learning\nYesterday, biology professors Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner raised the concern that workshops focused on evolution-related training do not reach not reach creationism-based biology teachers. Today, we'd like to focus on BioLogos' efforts to address that divide through our Biology by the Sea workshops.\nScientists Tell Their Stories: George Murphy\nDuring his seminary education, Dr. Murphy also gained a deeper understanding of Luther’s theology of the cross, and he realized that it’s really the best way to approach the science and theology dialogue.\nKatharine Hayhoe: Evangelical Christian, Climate Scientist\nAs an Evangelical and a scientist, Katharine Hayhoe is already a member of a rare breed. As a climate change researcher who is also married to an evangelical Christian pastor, she is nearly one of a kind.\nSeries: It's an Old World After All\nIn our sixth BioLogos videocast, we take a look at the age of the Earth. We explain four methods scientists have used to determine that age: tree ring, lake varve, radiometric, and seafloor spread dating, and also offer some theological insight on how an old earth can fit with the first chapters of Genesis.\nSeries: From the Dust\nIn this series, Ryan Pettey offers several clips from his powerful documentary \"From the Dust\". This feature-length film is divided up into various sections, each of which wrestles with the difficult problems that arise when reconciling Scripture with the theory of evolution. A light of hope dawns on the science-faith conversation, however, as scientists and theologians engage in honest dialogue about tough issues such as the interpretation of Genesis, the nature of the Fall, and the idea of random design. Their profound insights are sure to enlighten all minds, raise deeper questions, and provoke new thought.\nSeries: Genesis Through Ancient Eyes\nIn this talk, originally delivered at the BioLogos President's Circle meeting in October 2012, Dr. John Walton discusses the origin stories of Genesis 1-3, and why their focus on function and archetypes mean there is no Biblical narrative of material origins.\nGrowing in Faith\nAs he endeavored to learn more, David was intrigued by Francis Collins book The Language of God because Francis did not present evolution as a rival theory to Christian faith, but as something that described God's method of creation.\nSeries: Shaping the Human Soul\nIn Washington DC, Church of the Advent teamed up with The Trinity Forum to offer a series of lectures exploring the synergy between modern science and Christian Faith. This presentation by psychiatrist Curt Thompson and philosopher James K.A. Smith addressed the process of Christian discipleship and spiritual formation through the lens of neuroscience.\nUsing Film to Catalyze Conversations on Faith and Science\nWhat are the best ways to spark productive conversations about science and faith? Certainly there are books, articles, blogs (like this one), and podcasts. But there are particular advantages to using film.\nMending the Disconnect\nHow can it be that two things we love and treasure—two things that are absolutely central to ourselves and the lives we’ve built—seem so often to be at odds with each other?\nDid David Hume \"Banish\" Miracles?\n“I flatter myself,” Hume triumphantly proclaimed, “that I have discovered an argument . . . which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures.”\nSeries: Divine Action in the World\nIn this talk, Professor Plantinga addresses the fact that many contemporary thinkers—including many theologians—believe that God cannot perform miracles, providentially guide history, or interact in the lives of people, as these activities would be contrary to science. Plantinga, on the other hand, makes the case that this popular view is mistaken; excluding divine action in the world is not a central feature of natural science itself, but a philosophical or theological preference that has been added on to science (and can just as readily be removed). Plantinga concludes that it is completely logical to accept the miracles of the Bible and support contemporary science.\nHominids Lived Millions of Years Ago, but How Can We Tell?

{"text": "Business Rates Deferral Scheme 2012/13\nDeferred payment of 2012/13 rates liabilities\nThe Government has decided to put in place a business rates deferral scheme which will give you the option of spreading the Retail Price Index increase in your 2012-13 bill over three years, to help businesses manage their cash flow during the downturn. You will be able to defer payment of 3.2% of your 2012-13 bill – which is equivalent to 60% of the Retail Price Index increase – until 2013-14 and 2014-15. You will then pay back the total amount deferred over the next two years.\nHow to Apply\nPlease read the FAQSs below and if you wish to opt into the scheme, an application form is available at the foot of this page for you to download and print off. The form simply asks for your name, the address of the property and its reference number (which can be found on your business rate bill). Just complete those details, sign and return it to the address at the bottom of the form. You do not need to pay anyone to do this for you.\nYou can apply at any time until 31 March 2013 provided you have some of your bill left to pay. We would encourage you to apply early so that you see the reduction in your monthly instalments sooner, however, you will be able to defer 3.2% of the whole year’s bill regardless of when you apply. Provided that you return the application by 9 June, you will see the reduction in your July instalment. If you apply later than that date, you will see the reduction reflected in your next instalment or the one after that.\nNeed further information? - Contact the business rates section for any further information on 0121 303 5510 / 0121 303 5509 or 0121 303 5511, or by email at email@example.com\nFAQs (Further details are available at www.businesslink.gov.uk)\nWhat’s the deadline for applying? – You can apply at any time until 31 March 2013, as long as you have some of your bill left to pay, but we would encourage you to apply early.\nHow much of my bill can I put off paying? – You are able to put off 3.2% of the whole year’s 2012/2013 business rates bill.\nWhat if I have paid some or all of my bill? – You are able to put off paying 3.2% of the whole 2012/2013 bill, as long as you have that amount left to pay\nHow will my payments be reduced? – The amount you are putting off paying will be spread over your remaining payments for the whole year. For example, if you can put off £100.00 and you have four payments left to make, each of those payments will be reduced by £25.00.\nWill I pay interest on the amount I put off paying? – No\nHow soon will I see the benefit of making lower payments? – Provided that you return the application by 9 June 2012, you will see the reduction in your July instalment. If you apply later than that date, you will see the reduction reflected in your next instalment or the one after that. The amount you can put off paying will not change in both situations.\nWhen will I have to pay back the amount I put off? – You will pay back half the amount in 2013/14 and half in 2014/15, as well as paying your full bill for those years. Your rates bills in the next two years will include details of the amounts you have put off paying and need to pay, and your payments will be adjusted in line with this.\nWhat if I have more than one property? – If you have more than one property in the same council area, you only need to fill in one application form. You will need to give the council the address of all the properties you want to claim for. If you have properties in more than one council area, you will need to apply to each council separately.\nWhat if I stop occupying the property? – You will need to pay the amounts you have a duty to pay by law, including the amount you have put off paying. Your local authority will send you a revised bill, letting you know how much you should pay.\nWhat if I am already in arrears? – You do not automatically have the right to put off making any payments if you have already lost the right to pay your bill by instalments. You may still apply to put off making a payment, but it will be up to your local authority to decide whether or not to approve this. You may also want to talk to your local authority to discuss what other help is available.\nWill I be able to defer on the Business Rate Supplement element of my bill? – Yes. The deferment will also apply automatically to the BRS element of your bill (if applicable) on a pro rata basis. The only BRS in place for 2012-13 is the one levied by the Mayor of London to fund Crossrail which applies in London only at a rate of 2p on properties with a rateable value above £55,000. However, the 2p for the Crossrail BRS does not increase by inflation annually – so this element of your bill will in fact be the same as in 2011-12 if your rateable value is unchanged.\nWhat if I don’t keep up with my payments? – If you are struggling to keep up with your payments, you should talk to your local authority to discuss what other help is available.\nIs there any other help for businesses? – Further details of the full range of support and information available to businesses are available at www.businesslink.gov.uk.\nIs there any other help with rates bills for small businesses? – If you run a small business, further help may be available to pay your bills with Small Business Rate Relief. The level of Small Business Rate Relief has also been doubled for the whole of 2012-13. If you are occupying only one property with a rateable value of below £6,000 you may not need to pay any rates at all for 2012/13. Those occupying only one property with a rateable value of below £12,000 can benefit from a discount on your bill. The Government has also made it easier for eligible ratepayers with rateable values below £18,000 (£25,500 in London) to have their bills calculated using the small business multiplier.

{"text": "We continue our Nicaraguan nightmare in the thick of night back at Zappa (Zapatera). The moon hangs high while a salt and pepper haired cupcake of a man sits in the corner clutching his teddy bear and begs for team unity. \"We need to come together. We need to settle our differences.\", The Cuddler (Steve) laments. Lawyer Dave, however, doesn't give a fig about coming together. All he wants is to win and with that feeble-minded hippy sparrow Sarita on the tribe he fears that winning is merely but a wistful dream. You see, Sarita is one of those hot air people. They do a lot of talking but when it comes time to put those words into action, all that hot air leaks out and all you're left with is a shriveled up clump of cheap rubber with little strands of spit seeping out of it. Sarita is angry that Dave voted for her at Tribal Council. The only explanation she can come up with for his heinous act of dissension is that he's been lured over to the dark side. Really Sarita? A horned goat's head came out of the night and with a long bony finger beckoned Dave to join him in his underground lair where virgins are sacrificed and baby's blood is on the breakfast menu? Look, if that really happened that would be my Survivor fantasy come to life, but it didn't happen. Sarita sucks, Dave knows it, he's not afraid to say it and that's that. Meanwhile, The Cuddler is freaking out because his tribal unity is tainted and his lace bloomers haven't been ironed in days. Again I ask, wasn't he in the NFL for like many many years? My friend's 18 month old baby has more anger and gumption than Steve ever will. And what the hell is going on with Mike? Didn't he fight in a war for us? How is it that these paradigms of \"manliness\" are nothing but delicate little robin's eggs wrapped in pretty pink satin bows? Your honor, I move that Lawyer Dave is the only man on Zappa worthy of holding onto his balls. Off with the others!\nOver on Rhode Island (Redemption Island) a different sort of torture is taking place. Stephanie has been talking for the past 6 hours about food and the usually gentle and serene Pretty Pony (Matt) is about to cut her tongue out and feed it to the sharks. Do you remember Vanessa Huxtable's friend on The Cosby Show? The one who talked a mile a minute and made Dr. Huxtable's eyes bug out of his head? Well, that's Stephanie. \"ImeantheressomanythingsIloveVietnamesefoodThaifoodChinesefoodlikeItalianfood *inhale* Idon'tevenlikesweetsbutbringitonI'mgonnahaveasliceofredvelvetfromthisbakerythatIusedtoworkat *inhale* TheweirdestthingI'vebeencravingtohavelikebananashakeswithpeanutbutterinit *inhale* Theflavorofpeanutbutterlikesnickerdoodleswithpeanutbutterontop\" Poor Pretty Pony was sitting there fashioning a noose out of his buff and praying that death comes quick and painless. Suicide is a sin and I don't think it comes with a \"Get Into Heaven Free\" card, but Pretty Pony is willing to take that risk if it'll just make Stephanie shut the hell up.\nBack at Omarion (Ometepe), it's time to pick people to witness the Duel. Federal Agent Phillip announces that it's his turn to go again and upon hearing this Rob insists on attending the Duel with him. You see, Phillip is an unpredictable loose cannon. He could fire off all sorts of missiles of tribal information to the Zappa's and it's in Rob's best interest to make sure Phillip keeps his mouth shut and stays in line. Similarly, Phillip doesn't trust Rob either so he turns to his Samurai spirit guide, Miyamoto Musashi for inspiration. It turns out that Musashi was not only a psychotically unpredicatable sword wielder, but he wrote a book about 5 rings or something. I don't know about you, but when I hear \"5 rings\" I think of Christmas... \"Fiiiive goooolden riiiings\". Unfortunately, nothing about Musashi is Christmas-y. In fact, he was kind of a scary unkempt miscreant. He wandered the wilderness refusing to bathe or change his clothes because he feared being attacked while unprepared. With scars all over his face from congenital syphillis he'd challenge random people to duels for no reason at all. Once he whittled a wooden sword out of an oar and then bashed someone's head in with it. Now, I'm not a Buddhist or anything, but if it pleases the court, I move that Phillip is Miyamoto Musashi reincarnated. Both men could clearly benefit from a good scrubdown in addition to, oh I don't know, maybe a drug trial for some newfangled schizophrenia meds.\nOver at Rhode Island it's Duel time. Phillip and Rob are there representing Omarion with David and Rooster (Ralph) representing Zappa. In trots the Pretty Pony and I'm instantly shocked by his appearance. My normally resplendent equine loverboy is haggard and exhausted with sad little dark circles under his eyes. Frightened whiggedy whack strands of hair stick out of his usually pristine ponytail and I instantly gave Stephanie my devil death stare. Clearly, her words are poisonous little daggers of evil. She's sullied my pony! His purity is gone. The light in his eyes has dimmed. He's nothing but a damaged tattered representation of what he used to be. God cried that day my friends. God and me. We both cried. When beauty is lost all you can do is cry... or go nuts like Norma Desmond. It's up to you. *shrugs shoulders* Whatevs. Ok so this week the duel is going to test the Survivors memory. Grrrreat. Pretty Pony hasn't slept all night and his brain is filled with words and phrases like \"cake\" and \"chocolate dipped in peanut butter\". This is the worst possible time for this challenge. I hate you Dimples. Scattered in the arena are pairs of matching symbols. Each round you flip over two symbols and if they match you score a point. The first person to match five stays alive. Stephanie won the Rochambeau and has chosen for Pretty Pony to go first. You bitch! Survivors ready, go.\nPretty Pony does what any good Christian does. He gives up candy for Lent, makes the sign of the cross and hopes for the best. First, he flips over a skull and I thought to myself, \"It's a sign! It's a sign! This can't be good\" and then he flipped over another skull. I whipped off my shirt, dipped my breasts into two conveniently placed bowls of glitter and shouted at the screen, \"Suck on that Stephanie!\" Those etiquette classes I've been taking are really paying off. Stephanie takes her turn and flips a crocodile. Then, she flips another fucking crocodile. Oh, come on! Here I am thinking Pretty Pony is the second coming and devil girl Stephanie pulls a magical move out of her ass as well. Pretty Pony goes again and fails to make a match. The air is tinged with evil now. Any goodness that was lingering was killed when Stephanie matched those stupid crocodiles.\nFlip, flip, flip Pretty Pony makes two more matches and I knew that Jesus had finally awoken from his nap. Then Stephanie makes a match, claps for herself and I threw my gin glass at the screen. I learned that in Elocution Class. Flip, flip, flip the score is now 4-3 with Pretty Pony in the lead. He flips a calendar and knows he's seen the other one before, but all that's swirling in his head, thanks to Stephanie, are visions of macaroons and hot fudge sundaes. He gets the match wrong and it's Stephanie's turn again. She, too, flips the calendar. I covered my face with my hands and said, \"No match no match no match no match\". Someone somewhere was listening cuz girfriend screwed up and flipped war clubs. For his next turn, Pretty Pony looks up to heaven and let's the Holy Spirit fill his soul. He flips over the war clubs and then... he flips over ANOTHER war clubs. PRETTY PONY STAYS ALIVE!!!! I cantered around the room while Boston Rob reluctantly clapped.\nStephanie starts to cry and then she does what has become my favorite part of Rhode Island. She blabs all sorts of secrets and throws a tantrum like a sore loser. First, she says that there are people there that don't deserve to be there. Then, she turns to Rooster and tells him that he has to get rid of Sarita. She says that David is the only one that can do puzzles and I'm now convinced that he must have smuggled in a pocket game of Connect Four or something. Dimples pushes Stephanie to continue as he loves the spilling of secrets as much I do. She turns to Rob and tells him to watch his back and not to trust anyone on Zappa. She advises Rob to try to win Pretty Pony back and that made Matt laugh. In that moment, I knew, I just knew, that if Pretty Pony reenters the game, all hell is going to break loose. Everyone and no one is going to want him on their side. He's a number, but he's also a HUGE threat. With Jesus as his partner, I wouldn't put it past him to win Individual Immunity week after week. Does that make him the best player in the game? I don't know. Rob's been playing his game with a finesse I've never seen before. It's subtle yet skilled, psychological yet physical. Right now I'd be torn in a Pretty Pony/Boston Rob final two.\nThere's one more little thing we have to address before we leave Rhode Island. It turns out that Phillip is a fan of the Pretty Pony as well. He starts to quote the Bushido code I mentioned in my opening paragraph only he pronounces it \"Bee-shoe-doh\". Dry mouth syndrome. Anyhow, he tells Pretty Pony that he is indeed a Samurai warrior. Matt laughs and thanks him, but I shouted, \"No, he's not! Does he look like he has syphillis to you?! He couldn't hurt a butterfly let alone smash in some guy's brains in with a rotten old oar. You shut your face Phillip Sheppard!\" I was furious Phillip dared to compare himself to that precious angel, but Rob was pissed off for another reason. He was pissed that Phillip dared to open his mouth at all. It's clear to Rob now that Phillip is ready to make a big move. He's planting seeds and gathering up an alliance. I don't know. I think Rob is giving Phillip a little bit too much credit. I think all Phillip has up his sleeves is a clam shell walkie talkie and maybe a pinecone grenade.\nOn the way back to camp, Phillip asks Rob what they should tell the others about Rhode Island. He wonders if they should hold back intel and plan a covert operation. Apparently, Langley is waiting for word from Phillip on how to proceed. There are agents that need to be activated, fake passports to be made, interpol has to be notified. It's a whole big production and Phillip is anxious to get started. Rob quickly poo-poo's Phillip's idea to withhold info and tells him that it's best to keep their tribe strong and unified, but inside Rob was secretly celebrating. This was exactly the type of shady move he was praying Phillip would make. You see, now Rob can go back to camp and tell the others how Phillip wanted to get all Jason Bourne on everybody's ass. Mistrust is laid, Rob looks like the hero and, if Omarion loses again, Phillip is headed to Guantanamo where he'll have the best medical care the country has to offer.\nWhen they finally do arrive at camp, Rob immediately tells everyone how Pretty Pony won and Stephanie let it all hang out. Mascaroni (Andrea) stabbed her Pretty Pony voodoo doll in the face and then Rob told everyone how Stephanie said Rob is the number one target. Phillip nodded, acknowledged the tiny seashell earpiece in his ear and then went off into the woods to write a letter in invisible ink (i.e. urine). As soon as Phillip was out of earshot, Rob tells everyone about the Jason Bourne plan and assures them that as soon as they merge, Phillip's flipping. They decide then and there that if they lose the next challenge, Phillip is going home. And then Phillip fell out of a tree and tried to cover it up with a somersault. Ahem, Navy Seal training. Nothing to be alarmed at. Go about your business.\nOver at Zappa, The Cuddler wants to know if Stephanie said anything mean and nasty about him at Rhode Island. Did she pass any notes saying, \"Steve's stinky!\" or anything like that? These are things that The Cuddler is concerned with. Rooster mumbles \"Yeayaw, she'n wawntin' 'em ta beet us\". Lawyer Dave, on the other hand, said it really wasn't all that egregious and then Rooster wondered what 'egregious' meant. Sarita asks about the Pretty Pony and Rooster tells them that there's no way he'd flip sides at a Merge. I can see how Rooster would think that after Phillip rained down his Samurai speech on Pretty Pony, but I think Lawyer Dave may have been a tad more intuitive for he put his head down and walked away. After all, Stephanie did say to Rob that he should try to win Matt back. Rooster should have seen that as an opening to bring Pretty Pony into the fold. Instead he tells his tribe that Loy-yerr Dave will flip at the Merge which promptly sent Sarita into mom-mode and The Cuddler into a panic attack.\nSo while Zappa was lounging around content with being uninteresting and boring, Dave suggests they go out fishing. That storm the other night must have brought in some good pickings and they should take advantage of it. Leathery ole Julie rolled over and said, \"Uhhh nooooo, I think the storm brought in mud. It's nappy time.\" Dave then tried to explain how the currents close to the equator tend to run, what fish are migrating at that time of year in the Carribean Sea and how the high and low pressure weather systems will affect camp. In response The Cuddler grabbed his fluffy pillow and said, \"But it's mucky out there.\" Apparently, Rooster (from Virginia not Nicaragua) said the fishing is no good and the tribe would rather believe him than Loy-yerr Dave. Then, that battered ole piece of shoe leather, Julie, said Dave was driving her crazy and she went back to stretching her skin out to dry. What the hell is wrong with this tribe?! We know that Julie and The Cuddler are useless, but what's going on with Mike? I have a feeling that he's not exactly thrilled with the direction his tribe is headed in. I'm getting this vibe that he doesn't want to play ball with the geritol crowd. I'd like to see him speak up and do something, anything. Someone wave a mirror in front of his mouth so I know he's still breathing. Mike is like Bernie in Weekend At Bernie's. Does he have a pulse or not?\nOver at Omarion, it's lunchtime. The rice has been cooked and Phillip is chewing with a ferocity that I can only interpret as being morse code. I'm pretty sure he can chew and send messages at the same time. *chew chew... chew... chew chew chew chew STOP chew... chew chew... chew* Translated, I think it means: \"Water the marigolds. Viper is in transit. Need new panties.\" So everyone is happily eating their rice and Natalie has appointed herself as the Rice Hall Monitor. She's guarding the crispy rice for Rob because that's the only rice he eats. Phillip catches the name \"Rob\" on the wind, gets up and demands that he gets his share of crispy rice too. He's a 52 year old man not a red-headed stepchild. He should be entitled to exactly the same things Rob is entitled to. Then, Peter played ball in the house, Jan wore a wig and Phillip bellowed, \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!\" Why does Marcia (Rob) get to do everything?! All Phillip ever hears about in school is how good Marcia is at this or how great Marcia is at that. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia! Phillip is sick of being a redhead, sick of being ignored and sick of being treated like he doesn't matter. He's a senior member of this tribe goddammit. He's put in years of service and he wants his crispy rice pension now. When he signed the Constitution to be a part of Survivor it said very clearly in Article 1, Section 8: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes and Phillip Sheppard shall have power to collect his crispy rice. It's right there in black and white. You can go down to the National Archives and see it for yourself.\nNow we arrive at the big Immunity Challenge. It's a challenge we've seen before and it's one I've enjoyed very much before. Any time Survivors emerge like mud people and have to hurl their bodies against walls, an angel gets her wings. Ok so both tribes have to race through a series of obstacles collecting bags of balls. Once they've cleared all the obstacles, they have to shoot their balls into a basket. First tribe to get all 6 balls in the basket wins. Since the tribes are equal now, Sarita can't be a pussy and sit out. Also, they're playing for a helicpoter ride to a picnic complete with alcoholic beverages. Survivors ready, go!\nBoth tribes fly into a pile of hay and come tumbling out the other side. Sarita and Rob are then lifted into the air to unravel a bag of balls. Rob flings his bag around so it spins and spins and spins. Sarita limply raises her arm and wonders when this nightmare will end. Omarion gets their bag and begin crawling in the mud. Zappa finally gets their bag of balls and enters the mud. Since Julie is the same color as the mud I can only surmise that she sunk and hopefully we'll never see her again. Omarion is now at the wall of ropes where Phillip gets tangled up and kills Omarion's lead. Rob literally has to race back and carry Phillip through the last part of the obstacle. Since Sarita sucks at life, David goes up instead of her to work on the second bag of balls. Rob is also working on his balls but this time he flips them the wrong way and David pulls ahead. Zappa pulls ahead and approaches the maze of rope platforms. Sarita gets stuck and cries, \"Help me! Help me!\" while over at Omarion Rob is pretty much carrying on his Phillip on his back up and down all the rope ramps.\nZappa gets to their third bag of balls first while Phillip is still back asking a rope where his crispy rice is. David gets the third and final bag first and Zappa races to the brick wall. The Cuddler smashes into it, falls over and dies. Over on Omarion, Grant is the designated Smasher and breaks both walls for his team to climb through. At the end, it's a race to see who'll get their balls in the basket first. Toss, toss, toss, Grant probably played for the NBA, toss, toss, toss, balls are tied, toss, toss, toss OMARION WINS IMMUNITY!!! Sarita wanders around aimlessly wondering where she is, Dave drags The Cuddler's body through the mud and off somewhere in a private corner Phillip is making out with the Immunity statue. Hot.\nWithout further ado, Omarion is immediately whisked off in a helicopter to enjoy their Reward. The music is grand and sweeping, everyone is psyched to be in the chopper and Rob says that out of his 85 seasons of playing Survivor, landing on a volcano is the coolest Reward ever. Even Phillip is happy. Sure, he got tangled up in the ropes and sure Rob had to drag him by his panties through that entire last challenge, but the warrior inside Phillip is strong. A Samurai is nothing if not determined. Miyamoto Musashi once said, \"In fighting and in everyday life you should be determined through calm. Meet the situation without tenseness yet not recklessly, your spirit settled yet unbiased. Lucky numbers: 1,14, 22, 73, 96\" So while Phillip is busy musing about how much his tribe loves and cherishes him, Rob is digging yet another Immunity scroll out of a jar of spiral cookies. Since he already has the Idol and since it's pretty cool to throw stuff down into a large cavernous bubbling cauldron of scalding hot lava, he chucks the scroll without even opening it. A rock star move if ever I saw one.\nBack at Zappa, it's a rock star free zone. Sarita, of all people, addresses the tribe and says that Lawyer Dave isn't really all that great in challenges. Sarita, the spindly hiccup of a boil on the butt of competitiveness, thinks she's better in the challenges than Dave. I want to know where Sarita comes from because I think it would be a fun place to visit. Any place where there is LSD in the water supply has to be a good time, right? Her fingers probably make really cool trails and the trees outside probably talk to her. Book me a ticket. I like to escape reality every now and then. I usually do it with gin and a cornucopia of pharmaceuticals, but, hey, I'm up for anything. As long as I don't have to listen to the Grateful Dead and dance in Birkenstock's I'll hang with Sarita.\nSo, Sarita is making the rounds at camp slipping blotter into everyone's canteens and trying to convince everyone that David is a buzzkill to the tribal harmony. Rooster tells her David did awesome in the challenge today and Sarita shoves a handful of magic mushrooms in his mouth and says \"No, he didn't.\" Rooster replies, \"Yeauh'n yerrn probly raght.\" and off she scampers to drug another unsuspecting victim. Meanwhile, Dave is lugging an entire tree and preparing to whittle a court bench and a gavel or something. I have no idea. Did you see the size of that thing? It was huge! The only conclusion I can come to is that he wants a fair trial and is prepared to carve his own jury box. Either that or he's going to burn Sarita at the stake. Personally, I'm hoping for the latter.\nMeanwhile Mike is all twisted up inside worrying how to vote. On the one hand, SARITA SUCKS. On the other hand, David is crafty and might be planning a Sarita barbecue. He consults Rooster and Julie which is kind of like consulting a hairball and a belt and I began to wonder if Mike is capable of making any decisions on his own. He's a strong strapping guy. He's been to war for crying out loud. Why is he being such a follower? Shouldn't he have PTSD and grumble about all the carnage he's seen? My god, he's soooooo boring. What a waste of a casting spot.\nAnd this brings us to Tribal Council. Dimples asks Rooster how he thinks the challenge went and Rooster replies, \"Jayff, twas prettay close t'day. We was ahayd 'til we got ta them balls.\" Dimples interrupts him and says to Lawyer Dave, \"Finish this sentence. Excuses are for...?\" and Dave, without missing a beat, replies, \"Losers.\" Dimples sits back very pleased with himself while Rooster says, \"I'm a loser then.\" In that moment Julie grimaced, took her face off and made a purse out of it while Dimples took yet another opportunity to bring up Russell's name. Dave thinks the tribe lacks unity. They were all united when they got rid of Russell, but for some reason it's gone now. At one point they were all friends and shared a goal, but now there's only tension and chaos.\nDimples turns to Rooster and asks him how important it is for a tribe to be cohesive. Rooster replies, \"Way'll furss Jayff, I dun know what coyheesive means.\" *sighs* The tribe snickers to themselves and, in an attempt to simplify things, Dimples asks if he'd rather manage a group of guys who hated each other but got the job done or a group of guys who loved each other but did shit work. Rooster replies, \"I disagree.\" *smacks self in head* It was here that it dawned on me that Rooster doesn't understand anything anyone is saying... ever. He's a local guy with local ears and the only language he understands is Virginie. Mind you, I live in Virginia, but Rooster lives in Virginie.\nThe quorum continues and The Cuddler whined a little, Julie turned her arm skin into a leather headband and Sarita babbled some nonsense about the Oceanic Six. David continued to be a bit of an arrogant smartass, but I kind of dug it. On a tribe full of pussies you need a smartass. I wonder if I could get that handstitched on a pillow somewhere. In the end, Zappa did the right thing and Sarita is the seventh person voted out of Survivor: Redemption Island. Dumb bitch didn't even pack a bag.\nSo, what did you guys think of last night's episode? Are you glad Sarita went home? Do you think she has any chance against the Pretty Pony? If Pretty Pony comes back, will Mascaroni stab him in his sleep?

{"text": "On Amazon’s peak day, Dec. 15, customers ordered a record 6.3 million items, or almost 73 items each second, the company said. Last year, the peak day was Dec. 10, when customers ordered 5.4 million items.\nAmazon’s press release has all sorts of entertaining factoids: the weight of all GPS devices it sold from Black Friday through December equals the combined weight of 151 Mini Coopers; it sold enough “Breaking Dawn” books that, if stacked end to end, they would reach the summit of Mount Everest eight times; and its top sellers in electronics included a 52-inch Samsung LCD HDTV and the eight-gigabyte Apple iPod Touch.\nBut the numbers do little to tell us how good (or bad) Amazon’s season really was. The company didn’t disclose whether shoppers bought more or fewer high-priced items than in previous years or whether discounts ate into profit margins. It didn’t disclose revenue or even the total volume of products it shipped throughout the holiday season.\nWhat’s more, as consumers do more and more of their shopping online, where Amazon is the leading retailer, a “record” season at Amazon is hardly surprising. Amazon has claimed that its holidays were the “best ever” or “busiest ever” every year since at least 2002.\nAs Douglas Anmuth, an analyst at Barclays Capital, said in a note to investors early Friday: “AMZN’s announcement this A.M. that it posted another record holiday season should not come as a surprise given the ongoing secular shift toward e-comm., along w/ AMZN’s continued mkt share gains, but it appears likely to move the stock some in the N-T [near-term] given the lack of positive retail news flow & thin overall trading.”\nThe near-term stock gain did materialize, but it was short-lived. After the opening, Amazon shares traded as high as $53.95, a nearly 5 percent gain from their pre-Christmas close of $51.44. But shares slid throughout the day and closed at $51.78, up just 0.66 percent.", "id": "<urn:uuid:676f5cb7-5306-4b9f-b8d7-fce6775d89c7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/amazon-claims-best-ever-christmas-whatever-that-means/?hp&apage=3", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:59Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9576526880264282, "token_count": 465, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Talk about bad luck; Baking up a storm with less than a day standing between me and the ice cream party in Brooklyn, and disaster strikes. It’s a long story, but let me just tell you that I found myself with a sink full of glass and one less baking dish in my pantry. Flooded with regret and a mild sense of panic, having just broken a dish that had been a part of our family for even longer than I had been, a stunned silence pervaded my mind as I dropped each shard of glass into the trash bin, one by one. What to do, what to do. After a few moments of spinning my wheels unsuccessfully, the truth was became evident: I needed a new baking dish, as there were simply no others big enough to accommodate this crumble. Well, I was soon to find out that this was easier said than done.\nArriving at the local baking supply shop with a sense of urgency and my patient mother in tow, I searched fruitlessly for a matching dish. Employees soon came to my aide, offering up alternatives when the perfect pan didn’t present itself. A roasting pan? No, wrong shape. A jelly roll pan? No too shallow. So we departed with a bit more desperation than before, and ventured to the restaurant supply store. A myriad of fun gadgets and tools presented themselves, and I couldn’t help but poke a bit… But still, no baking dish. Off to investigate at a home supply store… but then, easily distracted as I am, I found myself in a spice shop instead. And then a Whole Foods. And then back at home, with no pan at all but plenty of groceries instead! Curse my wandering mind…\nFinally, after going back out a few hours later once the sun had disappeared from the horizon, I secured an acceptable substitute- The only catch was, this model was much bigger than the original, and so the recipe had to be enlarged to follow suit. I must warn you, this makes a huge helping of dessert, and I feared that I would end up taking a good bit of it back with me after the party. Much to my delight and surprise, it was actually the first thing to go, even served cold! So, if you’re hosting a crowd and want an easy dish that will leave a smile on your guests’ faces, this one’s for you.\nJust don’t go breaking that pan, or you might never find a replacement!\nApple Crumble for an Army\n1 Cup Whole Wheat Flour\n1 1/2 Cups Rolled Oats\n1 Cup Brown Sugar\n1 Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon\n1/2 Teaspoon Salt\n3/4 Cup Melted Margarine or Canola Oil\n1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract\n1 Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon\n1 Teaspoon Ground Ginger\n1/4 Cup Lemon Juice\n1/2 Cup Apple Juice Concentrate\n1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar\n3 Tablespoons Cornstarch\nPinch of Salt\n12 Apples (6 tart, 6 sweet)\n1 Cup Mixed Dried Fruit (Chopped into medium-sized pieces, if appropriate)\n1 Cup Slivered Almonds\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees.\nCombine all dry ingredients for the topping in a large bowl and slowly drizzle in the melted margarine or oil while stirring. It will seem dry at first, but don’t be tempted to add more liquid- Soon you will have coarse crumbs that are plenty moist. Set this aside for the time being.\nMoving on to the filling, whisk together everything but the fruits and nuts in a 17 x 12 baking dish. I started out using a large bowl, but it wouldn’t all fit, so save yourself the trouble of another dish to wash (this is the vessel that you’ll bake the crumble in, too.) Once that’s done, start peeling, coring, and slicing the apples (I used granny smith and fuji, by the way, but any mix you’d prefer would be equally tasty.) Put the apple slices in the mixture you’ve stirred up in the pan, and toss to coat thoroughly. Make sure you don’t leave any slices high and dry. When all the apples have been dealt with in a similar manner, stir in the dried fruit so that it’s evenly distributed (go for anything you’ve got in the house, but I happened to have dates, apricots, and currants on hand). Sprinkle the almonds over the top without stirring, and then sprinkle the oat mixture over that. Slide the whole thing into the oven for 40 – 50 minutes until browned and bubbly. Wait at least 10 minutes before serving and dish it out while still warm.\nServes 25 – 30", "id": "<urn:uuid:d6f97803-ee6c-4781-a828-e18ea808437f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bittersweetblog.com/2008/02/27/crumbling-under-the-pressure/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=ba53fcffb3", "date": "2013-05-18T05:24:39Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9477629065513611, "token_count": 1006, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Hingley & Sons Ltd, Washington Street, Netherton\n- Ref No: p/430\n- Repository: Dudley Archives & Local History Service\n- Date: [c1960]\n- Description: Goods wagon belonging to Hingley's on display in a museum.\n- Admin History: A forge and a small chain-making factory was founded by Noah Hingley (1796-1877) at Cradley, in the early 1800s. The company later produced pig iron for the manufacture of wrought iron. Noah Hingley leased mining areas from the Earl of Dudley in order to raise his own coal, limestone, and iron ore. Hingley's activities encompassed the Netherton Ironworks; The Harts Hill Iron Works; The Old Hill Furnaces; and various collieries. Until 1820, Noah Hingley was a nail master and maker of small chains, but by the 1830s, he had established himself as an ironmaster - manufacturing pig iron and wrought iron, before establishing his chain works at Netherton in 1837. It was one of, if not the largest cable making factory in the world. In 1848 he began making anchors and cables for the shipping industry. New extended premises were erected at Netherton in 1852. Noah Hingley died in 1877 and was succeeded by his son, Benjamin Hingley (1830-1905). He ran the company until 1895 when he was forced to retire due to a serious illness. The Company was then taken over by his nephews, George Benjamin Hingley (1850-1918), who became Managing Director, and Henry Montagu Hingley (1855-1909). George Benjamin Hingley was a long-standing member of the Midland Iron and Steel Wages Board; and served as vice-chairman of the South Staffordshire Ironmasters Association. By 1909, 90% of all Britain's production of chain took place in the Netherton and Cradley areas; and Hingley's was the largest chain manufacturer in that area, at one point, they were manufacturing some 10,000 tons of anchors and chains per year. Most of the big ocean-going liners of Cunard and other companies had anchors and chains made by Hingleys - for example in 1911, Hingley's manufactured the enormous 15 ton anchor for the ill-fated SS Titanic. The anchor was pulled through the streets of Netherton by 20 shire horses, and the townspeople turned out to watch the spectacular event. They also made the anchor for the yacht of Tzar Nicholas of Russia.\nOther companies were taken over from the early 20th century (some absorbed, others maintained as wholly owned subsidiaries, etc.) and further subsidiaries established. In the post-Second World War (1939-1945) era some dormant subsidiaries were revived and renamed as the group took on (albeit incompletely) a holding company-operating subsidiary pattern. Various activities were grouped (e.g. \"Engineering\") and in the 1960s subsidiaries and plants were rationalised. The whole group was absorbed by F.H. Lloyd and Company, Ltd. of Wednesbury in 1966 but the consequent reorganisation of management, subsidiaries and activities was not completed until 1970/71, at which time F.H. Lloyd was reconstructed as a holding company and Hingley's became one of its principal subsidiaries through which various of the old Hingley subsidiaries were controlled.\n- Level: Item\n- For more information contact: Dudley Archives", "id": "<urn:uuid:4c548116-da83-4d75-9a47-2a50f4c99431>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blackcountryhistory.org/collections/getrecord/GB145_p_430/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:59:06Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9637121558189392, "token_count": 876, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Navigational", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The Chicago Stadium Chair -- A Great Conversation Piece\nSunday, 04.06.2008 / 12:06 AM / Features\nBy Evan Weiner - NHL.com Correspondent\n|Former Blackhawk Darcy Rota has a Chicago Stadium seat in his home and it's a conversation starter for guests.|\nBoth Mets and Yankees officials would do well if they were to steal a 1994 idea from Chicago Blackhawks ownership before Chicago Stadium was closed down to make way for a new arena.\nOwner Bill Wirtz, gave away seats from “The Madhouse on Madison” to one-time Blackhawks players.\nDarcy Rota, who was a member of the Blackhawks from 1973 to 1979, has a seat in his home, and the seat is a conversation starter for guests.\nChicago Stadium hosted Blackhawks games from 1929 to 1994, as well the NBA's Chicago Bulls from 1967 through 1994, five United States political conventions and even an NFL playoff game in 1932 -- played on an 80-yard field. There was also a massive pipe organ built into the structure.\n\"I am sure they sent most of the players who played for the Blackhawks the chair,” Rota said. “For me, it's been something that is a great talk piece when people come to the house. It's got my name and my number when I played for the Blackhawks and the Blackhawks logo. But it is an old rickety chair and people get quite a kick out of it. The young kids and my young kids don't know about the Chicago Stadium.\"\nChicago Stadium had a colorful history and was unique. Players had to walk up and down a flight of steps to get to the ice surface, which was smaller than the standard 200-feet by 85-feet setup in the NHL. Therefore, there was less room between the blue lines. Plus, the place was maybe the loudest building in the NHL.\n|Real or imagined? The stories are great\nThe long and storied career of Gordie Howe also is a career full of stories that may or may not be true, as Evan Weiner explains in Off the Wall. ...more\nBut climbing up and down the steps was the biggest obstacle players had, and it was not an easy hike.\n\"You wanted to make sure you didn't slip because you were walking down steps with skates on,” he said. “You had to be careful about that. The odd guy would tumble and fall down the stairs. Basically, you had to watch your steps as you went down.\"\nIf one guy fell, it could have had a domino affect and a whole team of players could have fallen down at the same time. But during Rota's tenure, that never happened.\nThe console of the Chicago Stadium 3,663-pipe Barton Organ, which was played for years by Al Melgard, now resides in the Las Vegas home of Phil Maloof whose brothers own the NBA's Sacramento Kings. That organ was as much a part of Blackhawks history as Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita.\nIt was a legendary musical instrument.\n\"That organ was fantastic and it was a very, very special place to play,” Roda said. “(The rink) was about 185 feet long or so. It was a tough place for visiting players to play. People I know found it an intimidating place to play. If you weren't ready to play a game in Chicago Stadium you were in the wrong business because of the type of atmosphere in there. I always enjoyed the ice area, it was never a problem.\n“Now it's a parking lot and it's unfortunate that the Stadium is no longer there.\"\nChicago Stadium perfectly fit into its era and was vastly different from the other NHL rinks in Boston, Detroit, Montreal, New York and Toronto during the days of the Original Six between 1942 and 1967.\nSign up here for your FREE Playoff Fantasy Hockey Challenge team, exclusively on NHL.com.\n“You couldn't hide in the some of these Original Six places because the ice surfaces were small. A lot of history, a lot of tradition. Growing up as a young boy in Canada, of course following the Original Six teams and having an opportunity to play in the National Hockey League, it was pretty exciting. A lot of old rinks with lots of character are gone (now), replaced with fancy buildings for revenue opportunities now.”\nThe new arenas are, in some cases, too nice.\nThe chairs are too plush and don't have the character -- or probably the stories that a chair from Chicago Stadium could tell. It is well known that Blackhawks games routinely broke city fire laws because there were more people in the building than the 17,317-seat capacity. There was the fog horn after goals, Melgard and the organ, and if the chair could talk, the stories would probably be intriguing.\nAuthor: Evan Weiner | NHL.com Correspondent", "id": "<urn:uuid:7d18eb40-b653-4a8b-8160-57ee7b1e18a0>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=476999", "date": "2013-05-18T05:59:19Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9845765829086304, "token_count": 1008, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Dwight Howard and the Biggest Posers in the NBA\nBefore I start off this article, let me first say that I respect each and every one of these players. I admire the work they put in to get to the level they're currently at and they deserve all the credit for achieving their biggest goals and dreams.\nSo, that makes it a lot easier to say that we're going to find and discuss the NBA's top five biggest posers.\nWhat exactly is a poser? It's a player that's either attempting to be something they're not or a player that creates more problems than solutions. Whether it's on or off the court, these five usually are attempting to put on the facade that they're a completely different person.\nSome are physical specimens that play small and others are small players that attempt to pass themselves off as big.\nEither way, they all share the same characteristic of attempting to be something they're not or completely going against the gameplan. Instead of making the necessary adjustments and sacrifices needed, after demanding a trade to that team, you may just earn yourself a spot on the league's biggest posers.\nWe take a look at these five players and the reasons why they have ended up on this unfortunate list.\nSam Greenwood/Getty Images\nIt's become incredibly agitating seeing Dwight Howard and his latest opinion every other day.\nIt's annoying mostly because he didn't have to be in this situation in the first place. Howard was a free agent heading into the summer, but decided to take on an opt-in clause that would allow another year for the Orlando Magic to either make a compelling trade or find the players that could help Dwight to another Finals appearance.\nInstead, Howard started accusing the Magic organization of blackmailing him, although it's reasonable to believe Dwight didn't know what blackmail meant at the time. This came about when Dwight was under the belief the Magic front office tricked him into staying another year.\nThe Magic want to get rid of Dwight by this point, which is why they're listening to these awful offers from Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThey're tired of the headache their franchise center is causing and their angry that they just let go of their general manager and head coach because of Dwight, who was believed to have been behind a coup to oust Stan Van Gundy as the Magic coach.\nNow we continue to wait. The teams that Howard wants to go to don't have the trade chips to acquire him and every other team is backing off due to Dwight only wanting to re-sign in either L.A. or BK.\nSo much for Dwight caring about his fans. He's completely turned the fanbase against him after the embarrassing sequence of events that have taken place over the past few months.\nJeff Zelevansky/Getty Images\nIt's beginning to be tough to believe that Carmelo Anthony is capable of leading this New York Knicks team towards a championship run.\nIn a little over a season since he joined the Knicks, Anthony has yet to make a single adjustment. He took on the facilitator role early on and finished the season averaging only 3.6 assists per game to go along with a mere 22.6 points per game on 43 percent shooting. 'Melo's shooting and scoring were at the lowest since early on in his career.\nAnthony is an excellent player in an isolation setting, but he can't seem to involve his teammates. In fact, he's made Amar'e Stoudemire look worse every time they're on the floor together.\nThere were too many instances last season where Anthony would be taking nearly three times as many shots as Stoudemire, a player who was once arguably known as the best scorer at his position.\nThat's what Carmelo can do. He doesn't involve his teammates enough. Those one-on-one situations can only work for so long, before you have to begin involving your teammates in order to actually win games.\nThe only way the Knicks make a breakthrough and advance themselves is if Anthony makes the sacrifice and adjustment of playing off the ball and attempting to pass more.\nThis Knicks team is too stacked not to work. They have two excellent scorers and the league's top defender; there are absolutely no excuses for this team to get ousted in the first round.\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\nI'll let Udonis Haslem handle this one:\n‘I think sometimes people just use the TVs and the cameras and the crowd, you know, to put on a show. I don’t think he’s all that he shows out there on the court. I think anybody can be a tough guy with a thousand people watching on TV and referees who call fouls and stop the game and different things like that. I don’t seeing him being any tough guy that he puts on the show to be, at all … If we were playing at the park, I don’t think he’d be doing all that.\"\nThe Miami Heat have had some bouts with Kendrick Perkins since his Boston Celtics days. With Dwyane Wade driving to the rim as much as he did to will his team to victory, the Celtics would utilize Perkins as the bruising center who would hack at Wade to send a message.\nObviously, his longtime teammates, such as Haslem, would have something to say about it.\nPerkins also had something to say to LeBron James. Following Blake Griffin's tremendous poster on Kendrick, LeBron James sent out a tweet praising Griffin's dunk and downplaying the dunk he had over John Lucas that same day.\nOf course, Perkins had something to say to James, despite the rest of the NBA world also having something to say.\nWhy single out LeBron? He's not even saying anything about Kendrick Perkins in the first place. Blake could have performed the same dunk over any defender and James would have said the same thing. It's just Kendrick attempting to stir up some more animosity.\nAnd the perma-scowl etched on Perkins face? It can only work for so long.\nHarry How/Getty Images\nBlake Griffin is a 6'10\", 250-pound man-beast that is capable of jumping over buildings and running through brick walls.\nThings like this should never happen.\nIf you're that big and constantly creating contact in the lane, your jaw running into someone's shoulder shouldn't cause you to writhe in agony for an entire possession. There's a fine line between selling the foul and making yourself look foolish, and Griffin had no trouble crossing it and establishing an entire new area of the art of flopping.\nUnderstood that a lot of star players flop, but Griffin should never be flopping over minor hits or even attempting to flop in the first place. That's not a reputation you want to build early in your career, especially when it seems that so many opponents are gunning for you.\nBlake's become a target of many overly-physical fouls as a result of teams attempting to send a message.\nThe message is mostly used to keep Blake out of the lane, but it's also a message to experience contact worth complaining over.\nAt the age of 23 and after only two years, there's no room to flop and then constantly argue for fouls. I'd say when a jump shot and some solid defense comes around, then Blake could have some reasons to run to the officials in hopes that they'll reverse their decision and make a different call, preferably in his favor.\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\nThis one may be surprising to some, but if you saw what I saw in the Miami Heat's series against the Indiana Pacers, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.\nDanny Granger could not stop attempting to start an altercation with either Dwyane Wade or LeBron James. Numerous times throughout the series, Granger was caught annoying the two and attempting to create a situation out of nothing.\nMaybe once to send a message, but throughout the series?\nHe pulled on James' jersey to create an altercation, went over the top of LeBron to start a fight, and even going after Dwyane Wade, a player who is four inches shorter than him. That's three separate altercations in a series that lasted six games, all facilitated by Granger\nWho is Granger attempting to fool? He's usually been mild-mannered, so why did he suddenly become this big talker in a series against the Heat?\nIf he was trying to send a message, it obviously didn't happen because James and Wade shook off each instance. Granger was just attempting to annoy the two into playing badly, instead of utilizing his own average defensive abilities to contain either of the two.\nEither way, it was embarrassing; because Granger is certainly not the player who should be facilitating altercations.", "id": "<urn:uuid:bea51e46-eb72-4d46-9b5a-299951ee401b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1266366-dwight-howard-and-the-biggest-posers-in-the-nba", "date": "2013-05-18T06:21:40Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9823473691940308, "token_count": 1808, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Peyton Manning: Broncos QB Should Be Considered Top 5 Fantasy Quarterback\nPeyton Manning is back and believe it or not, enters the 2012 underrated for possibly the first time in his career.\nConsidering he’s learning a new offense in a new city with new teammates and coaches, fantasy owners don’t know what to expect from the 36-year-old future Hall of Famer.\nOh yeah, then there is the series of neck surgeries that kept him out for the entire 2011 season.\nAll things considered, the newest member of the Denver Broncos is going to be a fantasy risk…but it’s a risk worth taking.\nIn his debut last Thursday against the Chicago Bears, Manning was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and an interception. The interception was off a fluky deflection that hit Brandon Stokley in the shoulders in the pouring rain.\nWe all know you would be crazy to judge Manning on one drive in a meaningless preseason game, but it was encouraging to see him barking orders at the line of scrimmage and still possessing some serious zip on the ball. His neck didn’t appear to bother him one bit.\nLooking at the Broncos roster, the two candidates to help Manning’s life easier right away will be Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker. At 6’3’’ and 230 pounds, Thomas is the perfect red-zone target for Manning and also his best deep threat. He is a budding star that can fully blossom under the tutelage of Manning.\nRemember, this is a guy that’s been stuck with Kyle Orton and Tim Tebow in his two seasons in the league. Collecting 1,000 yards and 10 TDs is certainly in the realm of possibilities.\nThen there is Decker, my pick to end up as Manning’s go-to receiver.\nThe pair connected on a beautiful 19-yard gain Thursday when the Broncos were facing 3rd-and-17. Decker, who excels out of the slot, has the crisp route-running ability and sticky hands that have made plenty of Colt receivers millions of dollars in the past. Decker is a cerebral player who can handle the load Manning gives him.\nExpect their chemistry to be spectacular as the season rolls on.\nWith a strong running game and above-average O-line, Manning has all of the tools to put up big numbers on a team with plenty of potential.\nThe incredible stat of Manning that gets swept under the rug is his 227-game streak of consecutive starts. This guy was the symbol of consistency before suffering the neck injury. In a league where one hit can end a career regardless of who the player is, his durability over the last 13 seasons of action can’t be overlooked.\nIs Peyton Manning a Top-5 Fantasy QB in 2012?\nDon’t let his neck injury be the only reason you skip Peyton.\nManning isn’t going to put up the same type of numbers that Drew Brees, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers will in 2012, but he will be a better pick than the injury-plagued Matthew Stafford, the consistent but not amazing Matt Ryan, the turnover prone Tony Romo, and Ben Roethlisberger, who is already dealing with a slew of injuries.\nManning has always been fantasy gold, and there is no reason to believe 2012 will be any different.\nPeyton is back and ready to play a major part in winning you a fantasy football championship.

{"text": "MLB Trade Rumors: Alfonso Soriano and the Top 10 Moveable Players on the Market\nAfter the months of speculation leading up to July's trade deadline finally came to a head, it seemed like we could all finally breathe a bit and watch the second half of the MLB season play itself out.\nThat notion was quickly put to rest when the waiver wire acted up in August.\nWe saw players like Joe Blanton and Cliff Lee make news, and while a deal for Lee was never reached, that doesn't mean that others wouldn't be made.\nThe blockbuster deal sending seemingly half of the Boston Red Sox to the Los Angeles Dodgers certainly turned the heads of the entire baseball world, and while it may be impossible to expect another trade like that, it doesn't mean that the action has ceased.\n10. Travis Hafner\nLeon Halip/Getty Images\nDuring Travis Hafner's best days, he was one of the most dangerous hitters in the AL Central and was consistently in AL MVP consideration.\nHe's run into issues staying on the field since then and is currently on the 15-day disabled list, but if healthy, he can still definitely be a home run threat in the Indians lineup.\nEither way, you would think a trade may be more likely to occur as the team has fallen back from contention in the division. For quite some time, it's looked like this would be Hafner's last season in Cleveland.\n9. Andres Torres\nRecently placed on waivers by the New York Mets, outfielder Andres Torres isn't having an outstanding 2012 season by any means, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be a useful target for a contending team down the stretch.\nThe center fielder is batting just .233 this season, but a 16-homer campaign in 2010 in which he stole nearly 30 bases shows just what he's capable of when he's at his best.\nHe'll be under team control for another season, and at just under $3 million this season, Torres wouldn't break the bank.\n8. Carlos Marmol\nJoe Robbins/Getty Images\nControl is a premium for relief pitchers hoping to make a positive impact for their team, so it's no surprise that Carlos Marmol has been a disappointment on the mound in 2012.\nWalking nearly nine batters per nine innings, he has a WHIP approaching 2.00 and an ERA of 4.02.\nWith the Cubs looking to rebuild in any way they can, it wouldn't be surprising to see Marmol, who recently cleared waivers, head out of Wrigley sooner rather than later.\n7. Scott Hairston\nJason Szenes/Getty Images\nThirty-two-year-old Scott Hairston has had a relatively successful 2012 season thus far, with a batting average approaching .275 and the highest home run total (14) he's posted since 2008.\nThe New York Mets have a lot of decisions to make this offseason, and deciding on whether or not to retain Hairston may not be one of them.\nThe utility player was placed on waivers along with teammate Andres Torres, and as teams continue to define needs as they head into stretch runs, Hairston could pique the interest of suitors.\n6. Justin Morneau\nJared Wickerham/Getty Images\nAfter struggling through concussion problems and other injuries over the past couple of seasons, Justin Morneau appears to finally be hitting his stride.\nHe's gone deep 17 times in 102 games so far in 2012. With his numbers up in virtually every category from last season, Morneau would be a great add for any team looking to bring in a home run threat.\nWith this weekend's news, it's hard to believe the Dodgers would still be interested, but in eight games this month, Morneau is batting .333 with four home runs, 14 RBI and an OPS of nearly 1.000. He'll certainly fit in somewhere.\n5. Jeff Francoeur\nJ. Meric/Getty Images\nThe San Francisco Giants found themselves in a serious predicament recently when they lost slugger Melky Cabrera for the rest of the season after he was handed a 50-game suspension for testosterone usage.\nWhether or not they look to outside sources for help in the outfield remains to be seen, but as Ken Rosenthal of FoxSports.com points out, they could look towards Kansas City Royals outfielder Jeff Francoeur as a short-term solution.\n4. Jacoby Ellsbury\nJared Wickerham/Getty Images\nThe Boston Red Sox lineup card has seen some serious changes in the past handful of days, with a number of top stars making their way to the west coast.\nIt would be hard to believe they'll continue to look to unload talent, but as Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe noted, Jacoby Ellsbury is the most recent player in Fenway to hit the waiver wire.\nNo suitor has been revealed, but a team like the Los Angeles Angels could benefit from a player of Ellsbury's caliber, especially as they fight for attention in the city with the suddenly-revamped Dodgers.\n3. Edinson Volquez\nDenis Poroy/Getty Images\nIn his first season in San Diego, Edinson Volquez has posted an 8-9 record with an ERA hovering just over 4.00.\nHe'll be under team control for another season, but the starting pitcher has been placed on waivers, and with his name popping up in July with a connection to the Atlanta Braves, it wouldn't be surprising if he garnered some additional interest now.\n2. Justin Upton\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\nAs is the case anytime the waiver wire lights up, players that almost certainly won't move are pushed out there, even if it means they'll still finish the season in the same uniform.\nWith the mega trade that we just saw send some superstars from Boston to Los Angeles, it's clear that anything is possible.\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks did place star Justin Upton on waivers, and while it's not clear whether or not any serious suitors could emerge, it's definitely something worth watching.\n1. Alfonso Soriano\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\nEarlier, we mentioned the San Francisco Giants' potential need for additional help in the outfield. While Jeff Francoeur may be a more thrifty option to bolster the lineup, adding a player like Alfonso Soriano would help the team match the wheeling and dealing of the division-rival Dodgers.\nSoriano is owed $18 million per season through 2014, and while he's been considered somewhat of a black hole from a salary perspective, he's been relatively consistent, going deep at least 20 times every season since 2001. This season, he has his highest batting average since 2008.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1569c96f-e5fd-4690-a3c1-b5724314fb65>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1311758-mlb-trade-rumors-alfonso-soriano-and-the-top-10-moveable-players-on-the-market", "date": "2013-05-18T05:06:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9701288938522339, "token_count": 1392, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Ranking the Pac-12's Toughest Schedules\nA month into the college football season, the rankings have gone through some changes.\nThree overrated pretenders (Michigan, Wisconsin and Arkansas) have fallen, one (Oregon State) has risen and three (Arizona, USC and UCLA) have risen and fallen only to rise again.\nNow, there are still a few questions about the Pac-12 that, when answered, will allow us to determine which Pac-12 team has the strongest (or scariest, depending on how your team is doing right now) schedule.\nFirst, where does Southern Cal belong? My gut says the Trojans still take the South, but the Bruins and Sun Devils may make some noise before all is done. Speaking of the Sun Devils, where does one put Arizona State in a Pac-12 power ranking? Many have ASU fifth or sixth, but the Sun Devils could easily be third or fourth.\nMany questions remain unanswered as the calendar flips to October. But, as of now, which teams look like they will truly run the gauntlet in Pac-12 play this year?\nThese five teams have the toughest road to the title.\n5. Washington Huskies\nOtto Greule Jr/Getty Images\nThis last slot was difficult to place. I considered USC and Colorado. Both have schedules of similar difficulty. USC's is loaded with good teams at the end of the season. Colorado's is toughest in October and November. But several of its toughest opponents play the Buffaloes in Boulder.\nI wanted to put the Huskies lower (or higher, I suppose). They have three Top-10 teams (LSU, Stanford and Oregon) on their schedule in their first five games, and their October schedule is no cupcake buffet. But they close with an easy November that, with the early-season win over Stanford, should give them at least seven wins.\nWashington lost to LSU in Baton Rouge and has road games at Oregon and Arizona State. But USC and Oregon State have to visit Seattle in October and hope they don't end up like Stanford.\n4. California Golden Bears\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\nAt times, such as against Ohio State in Columbus, Cal looked like a 7-5 team, but the Bears choked against earlier and easier competition, and now they are reeling, looking for a Pac-12 win somewhere, anywhere. Their schedule, however, isn't forgiving. It has seven ranked teams, possibly eight, with Arizona State on the cusp.\nOnly three of those games are away, which is bad. Why bad? Isn't a home game against a great opponent usually a good thing? Well, if you are the Bears and are expected to get crushed, wouldn't you rather get crushed on the road and save the games you might be able to win for home, in your brand-new stadium?\nInstead, the Bears' best hope of snagging that Pac-12 victory is in Pullman against Washington State on Oct. 13.\nWhat's even worse about the Bears schedule is that there are no breaks. Though they need time off, they go at it every week. The longest span between games is November 2nd to November 10th. They face the Washington Huskies and then the Oregon Ducks.\n3. Stanford Cardinal\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\nThough they've taken a lot of heat for their lack of offense in last week's loss at Washington, I have to hand it to the Cardinal: they don't choose to take the easy road.\nAfter the first two games (easy victories over San Jose State from the WAC and Duke from the ACC), Stanford's ride is rough, with seven ranked or previously ranked opponents, split into chunks of four and three at a time.\nFour of those ranked games are away (Washington, Notre Dame, Oregon and UCLA) and the other three are at the Farm. They've already dropped one away from home, so the Cardinal have to hope their sputtering offense doesn't become a trend when on the road.\nAnd you know what's really annoying (for a Stanford fan, anyway) about that loss to Washington (well, other than the loss)? It feels like they wasted their off week. Now they just have to ride it out.\n2. Oregon State Beavers\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\nNot many were expecting Oregon State to make a turnaround quite as sharply as it has. Now every game on a Pac-12 schedule with the Beavers is suddenly scary.\nAnd it's not like Oregon State is rising on the backs of lesser foes. The Beavers' first big game (and really, their first game) was against the overrated No. 13 Wisconsin Badgers. But at the time, we didn't know this, at least not quite. Wisconsin had trouble the week before against Northern Iowa, as it looked like David was slapping Goliath all around the field).\nNext, the Beavers toppled UCLA in the Rose Bowl. Then they headed into the desert against an angry Arizona team looking to bounce back from a humiliating defeat to Oregon. The Wildcats almost won, until Oregon State QB Sean Mannion stole it from them on a stunning last drive.\nWith so many high-profile victories, one almost forgets that they were all hard-fought, two of them on the road. But that's the way the Beavers roll, as evidenced by their roller-coaster ride of a schedule.\nOf their seven ranked matchups, five are away (and the Civil War with Oregon doesn't really give them home-field advantage).\nHow long the Beavers can sustain their drive is anyone's guess. But the Pac-12 is on alert: Look out for Oregon State.\n1. Arizona Wildcats\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\nWashington and Oregon State have gotten attention for their rough September and October schedules, probably the roughest in all of college football, some pundits claim.\nThat has to mean that no one has looked at Arizona's schedule because... well, words can't capture it. Take a look: Toledo, Oklahoma State, South Carolina State, No. 2 Oregon, No. 14 Oregon State, No. 18 Stanford, Open Date, No. 23 Washington, No. 13 USC, No. 25 UCLA, Colorado, Utah, Arizona State.\nThat's right. In a seven-week stretch, from September 22nd to November 3rd, Arizona has six ranked teams on its schedule, three of which have been in the Top 10 (with the Beavers on the cusp), with half of those games on the road.\nI, for one, am impressed with how well Rich Rodriguez, Matt Scott and company have endured against such a difficult slate. One can easily imagine that if the big games were a bit more spread out, the Wildcats might have a chance to pull off upsets similar to what they did against Oklahoma State.\nAs it is, even the open date hardly seems like enough of a buffer to regroup and heal, The 'Cats are already battered and thinned two games into this rigorous stretch.\nCan they keep it together to the end and earn a bowl berth, or will the gauntlet destroy them?\nI expect we'll know the answer by the end of this month.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a1fb3980-c936-492a-a3d1-fee6592891d1>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1358169-ranking-the-pac-12s-toughest-schedules", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:59Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.977868378162384, "token_count": 1497, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Ronaldinho: Can He Make the Brazil National Team for the 2014 World Cup?\nHe is a player who will forever live in the hearts of football fans worldwide. Indeed, Ronaldinho's five-year spell at Barcelona last decade ranks among the greatest periods of individual brilliance ever seen in the game. He was simply untouchable.\nThe iconic No. 10, though, has seen his career fade since his departure from Camp Nou. He failed to ignite in a two-year stint at Milan, and his return to Brazil with Flamengo was an unmitigated disaster, largely due to off-pitch incidents.\nAfter a disappointing showing against Ghana, though, former coach Mano Menezes decided that the experiment had failed—Ronaldinho was no longer able to keep pace at the highest level.\nJust over a year later, though, the calls for his return to the Seleção can be heard again.\nFollowing an acrimonious end to his time at Flamengo, Ronaldinho was offered redemption in the form of a short-term contract at Atlético Mineiro.\nThe results have been impressive.\nThe ponytailed playmaker came into the club under unusual circumstances. For the first time in his illustrious career, there had not been a clamour to secure his signature. Ronaldinho was tainted by accusations of poor professionalism, as well as a general feeling that his best days were just a distant memory.\nAtlético, though, gave him his chance and have been rewarded greatly for their gamble. The Porto Alegre-born star has inspired a club that was close to relegation last campaign. Alongside the likes of rising star Bernard and former Manchester City striker Jô, Ronaldinho has led a revival.\nReward came this past week as, having helped the club to second place in the league, Ronaldinho was named the Brazilian championship Player of the Year.\nThe difficulty for new Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari will not be deciding whether Ronaldinho is worthy of a place to take on England in February. On current form, he could undoubtedly offer a useful contribution.\nThe issue will be whether there is enough reason to believe that the two-time FIFA World Player of the Year will still be performing at these levels in eighteen months' time, when football's biggest festival visits Brazil for the first time since the country's famous Maracanazo defeat of 1950.\nRonaldinho has undoubtedly been in fine form for club side Atlético, but his lifestyle still draws criticism. It was the main reason behind his exit from Barcelona in 2008 and remains an issue that he has never fully resolved.\nI want to see him behave like a player that wants to be a world champion. He needs to change a few things.—Mano Menezes, former Brazil coach told Arena SporTV in March 2012\nHe has enjoyed a fine season, without question, but there are legitimate concerns that he cannot maintain this form in the long run.\nHe enjoyed a similar purple patch at Flamengo, but performance levels dropped off after a few months. That said, the club's inability to pay their player on time undoubtedly contributed to his decline in both form and professionalism.\nQuestions should also be asked regarding his ability to transfer this recent form onto the international stage. As everybody knows, the domestic game in Brazil is an entirely different beast. In this regard, there are several factors to consider.\nIf Brazil are to compete with the likes of Spain and Germany at the World Cup, it will not be through the sort of tactics seen in the Brasileirão. The attacking midfielders cannot simply ignore their defensive work and linger on the halfway line, waiting for the ball to be launched forward by the defence. That would be disastrous.\nThus, Brazil are going to need players who will close down, track back and, when in possession, offer a dynamic presence. In Brazil, Ronaldinho is afforded space to play the game at his pace.\nAs he found on his last attempt at international football, though, the pace of the game could be too much for him.\nWith those arguments against his recall, what are the arguments in favour?\nWill Ronaldinho make the 2014 World Cup?\nWell, firstly, his previous working relationship with Scolari can only help. Ronaldinho helped Brazil to their fifth World Cup triumph in 2002 under the veteran manager and will hope that this relationship can earn him another shot.\nScolari will not accept underperformance, but could be willing to give his former charge a chance to prove himself ahead of the Confederations Cup.\nRonaldinho may not be the same player he once was, but does he need to be? With the energy of young starlets Neymar and Oscar around him, there is an argument that the former Barcelona man could be accommodated. That is something Felipão must consider.\nWhat Ronaldinho has shown this season is that he still has the skill and guile to unlock defences, even if it is now normally with a pass rather than his dribbling abilities. The Atlético star also offers more of a threat from set pieces than any current member of the squad.\nWe are all aware that we have a dual responsibility in this tournament. The first is to present a type of football that honours our tradition.—Dilma Rousseff, Brazilian president at a press conference in December 2012.\nScolari is truly in a fortunate position regarding creative options: Oscar, Neymar and Lucas Moura are all brilliant players and should still improve over the next 18 months. However, the trio will be aged just 22, 22 and 21 respectively when the tournament comes around.\nThis is where Ronaldinho, Robinho or Kaká could have some use. Ronaldinho has enjoyed a fine campaign, Robinho is still adored in his homeland and Kaká has performed well since recall to the squad earlier this year.\nIt would be a mistake to rely on the trio given their indifferent form in recent years, but their experience could prove invaluable as part of a very young squad. They will not all be involved, but it is likely that Scolari will look to involve one or two of the three—even if just as an option off the substitutes' bench.\nWith Brazil hosting the tournament, the team simply have to perform, and must do so with a style and panache worthy of their traditions.\nScolari now has three months to consider whether a fit, focused Ronaldinho can be the showman that the Brazilian public so desperately crave.\nWhat is the duplicate article?\nWhy is this article offensive?\nWhere is this article plagiarized from?\nWhy is this article poorly edited?", "id": "<urn:uuid:c767ea27-4546-4cb7-9c11-0bd5be5aec99>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1434947-ronaldinho-can-he-make-the-brazil-national-team-for-the-2014-world-cup", "date": "2013-05-18T05:33:30Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9822767376899719, "token_count": 1373, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

The Cowboys are coming off a great road victory over the scorching hot Cincinnati Bengals.\nThe Steelers, however, are coming off one of the more disappointing performances of the season. They lost to the San Diego Chargers at Heinz Field.\nNo, Charlie Batch wasn't in the game throwing three interceptions while looking terrible. Ben Roethlisberger was back under center and received little help from the offensive line, his running backs, Todd Haley and his receivers.\nNow the two will lock horns in Dallas this week with a lot on the line.\nMike Tomlin and his Steelers have a way of getting up for big games. Dallas is a team that every team can get up for, and Tomlin will have his guys ready similar to what they were against the Baltimore Ravens last week.\nJust when Dallas has your attention, they find a way to blow it down the stretch. They will do it again.\nPrediction: Steelers 20, Cowboys 17.\nNew York Giants defeat Atlanta Falcons\nAll teams go through a funk at one point of a 16-game season. Atlanta is currently going to go through that funk.\nWith the Giants coming into town, and with their ability to get up for games, New York and Eli Manning will find a way to get the job done in Atlanta.\nAtlanta's defense is average this season. Prior to Sunday's game against Carolina, the Falcons ranked 15th in passing yards allowed and 20th in rushing yards allowed.\nIf Manning can receive time to throw the football he will carve up the Falcons' defense.\nAlso, Matt Ryan hasn't been overly impressive since playing the Saints on Nov. 11. Since that game, Ryan has accounted for four touchdowns and seven interceptions.\nAgainst a stingy defensive front four, New York will find a way to rattle Ryan just like they did last year in the postseason.\nPrediction: Giants 27, Falcons 23.\nSan Francisco 49ers defeat New England Patriots\nRemember when the Arizona Cardinals went to New England and defensively defeated the Patriots earlier this season? They forced a turnover, held New England to 5-of-15 on third downs and won at the line of scrimmage.\nSan Francisco will play that same exact role in Week 15.\nThe 49ers are another team that gets up for games when they feel disrespected.

{"text": "Michigan vs. Ohio State: Twitter Reaction, Postgame Recap and Analysis\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes got off to a fast start and held on for the thrilling 56-53 win at home. The loss was the first of the season for the No. 2-ranked Michigan Wolverines.\nThere are now no unbeaten teams in Division I NCAA basketball.\nThe Wolverines fought back from a 20-point deficit to tie the game on two occasions late, but they didn't have the final push to pull out the tough road victory.\nThis was a great game to watch and served as a preview of things to come in the Big Ten Tournament and March Madness in general.\nHere is a balanced account of what took place at the Value City Arena in Columbus, Ohio.\nMichigan assistant coach Bacari Alexander gave this pregame speech to his team before the loss to the Buckeyes on Sunday.\nThe Wolverines came into the game as the nation's last undefeated team, and everyone wanted to know if this was the day the \"0\" would go. That includes ESPN's Jay Williams:\nThis game had several qualities. The sweet alley-oop plays were just one aspect:\nThe Wolverines battled back from a 20-point deficit to tie the game, and that resiliency made this a regular-season gem:\nAnd #Michigan has tied the game! WOW. We got a game!— ESPN College BBall (@ESPNCBB) January 13, 2013\nESPN's college hoops Twitter feed delivers the news:\nBBall (@ESPNCBB) January 13, 2013\nHow the Buckeyes Won This Game\n16-0 Run Early in the First Half\nPerhaps the Wolverines were overconfident heading into this game. It is possible the speech from Alexander didn't help matters.\nIn any case, they didn't look as though they were ready to match the Buckeyes' intensity.\nWith strong and aggressive defense, the Buckeyes built a huge lead on a strength of a 16-0 run. After Trey Burke started the game with a three-pointer, the Wolverines found themselves down 16-3 shortly thereafter.\nPart of the product of the Buckeyes defense was a plethora of turnovers from Michigan. The Buckeyes harassed the Wolverines into 13 miscues, with nine coming in the first half.\nComing into the game, Michigan was averaging just nine giveaways per game.\nWolverines Should Have Played Zone From the Beginning\nThe Buckeyes have only one dependable scorer in the half court, and that is Deshaun Thomas. Michigan starting the game in man-to-man coverage allowed Thomas to get off early, as they didn't have a defender who could contain him.\nHe finished with 20 points, and the other Buckeyes who excelled offensively got most of their buckets in transition.\nNo other Buckeye had double figures in the game.\nAaron Craft and Sam Thompson each had nine points, but seven of Craft's points came in the first half.\nThe Wolverines' eventual switch to a zone midway through the first half keyed the comeback, but the Buckeyes had already gained momentum.\nHeroes and Goats\nHeroes: Deshaun Thomas and Sam Thompson\nThomas continues to prove he is a prime-time scorer and leader. He made several big shots en route to another impressive scoring performance.\nThompson's energy on defense led to crowd-igniting slams and constant pressure on the ball.\nGoat: Trey Burke\nBurke's NBA draft stock took a hit in this game.\nHe didn't display a ton of poise, struggling to get his team into the offense. He also didn't shoot well, as Craft's tenacious defense seem to bother him all game. This led to a few questionable shots.\nBurke finished with 15 points and four assists, but he only shot 4-of-13 from the field, and he committed four turnovers.\nHe was not as good as his team needed him to be.\nMichigan showed a lot of heart in coming back, and it nearly won this game.

They must grow up quickly if they plan on going deep into the NCAA tournament.\nThe Buckeyes scored a huge win at home, but their lack of offensive options will hurt them against top teams.

{"text": "Demetrious Johnson vs. John Dodson: What Went Wrong for Dodson?\nOn Saturday night in the United Center in Chicago, the UFC flyweight championship was on the line as Demetrious Johnson defended against Ultimate Fighter winner John Dodson. The battle was fast-paced, as expected, although few would have guessed that Demetrious Johnson would be dropped three times in the opening frames of his first title defense.\nHowever, in Round 3, everything turned around for \"The Magician,\" and 15 minutes later, he saw Johnson have his arm raised as Bruce Buffer announced \"Mighty Mouse\" as the bout's winner.\nSo what went wrong for John Dodson?\nLack of Killer Instinct\nIn Round 2, Dodson scored a four-punch combination that dropped Johnson hard. All signs pointed to a new champion; however, the challenger apparently couldn't smell the blood in the water.\nInstead of pressing the action and unleashing a flurry of strikes on his downed opponent, Dodson allowed Johnson to return to his feet and gave him a moment to recover.\nLater in the frame, he landed another big shot that sent Mighty Mouse down, and this time he charged forward. However, this opening wasn't as good as the previous one, and Johnson was quickly back to his feet.\nIf the \"what if's\" in your life are going to haunt you in your senior years, there is no question that Dodson will always wonder what would have been if he had put his foot on the gas at a time that demanded it.\nConditioning Not Enough for Five Rounds\nHow many pitchers do you see take the mound and throw fastballs over and over again for nine full innings?\nThe reason that John Dodson faded after Round 3 lies in the fact that he throws a lot of haymakers. The flyweight has never had cardio issues in previous bouts, but then again, this is the first time that heavy-handed speedster went into championship rounds.\nWhen Dodson couldn't keep his foot on the gas any longer, Johnson kept the pressure at a maximum and used superior technique to do a lot of damage up against the cage.\nDemetrious Johnson Has Too Much Heart\nSome may look at Johnson vs. Dodson as a flyweight version of Frankie Edgar vs. Gray Maynard. The challenger has heavy hands and used them well in the early rounds. The champion recognizes the terrible situation that surrounds him and refuses to relinquish his belt.\nAnyone who witnessed Johnson's fight with Joseph Benavidez saw exactly what his determination can accomplish. Benavidez secured a deep guillotine choke that should have ended the fight; however, the pure will of Johnson gave him the strength to frantically wiggle free and save himself.\nThat same determination saw Johnson test his own limits and drown Dodson in deep waters for the final rounds.\nIn any event, this was a great performance for John Dodson. He represented The Ultimate Fighter well and gave reason for viewers to believe that the show can still deliver championship fighters.\nUnfortunately for The Magician, it was Johnson who proved himself the better man. With some quality performances in 2013 and a little bit of luck, he could find himself in title contention once again in early 2014.\nWhat is the duplicate article?\nWhy is this article offensive?\nWhere is this article plagiarized from?\nWhy is this article poorly edited?", "id": "<urn:uuid:39873c6f-3951-4748-91e0-110822fa5ff6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1502636-demetrious-johnson-vs-john-dodson-what-went-wrong-for-dodson", "date": "2013-05-18T06:02:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9818020462989807, "token_count": 699, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Washington Nationals: Are They Better Than the Atlanta Braves?\nPatrick McDermott/Getty Images\nThe Washington Nationals were perceived as locks to win the National League East after another strong offseason. However, after the Atlanta Braves acquired Justin Upton from the Arizona Diamondbacks, there is now a debate as to which team is better.\nYet, despite the Braves' big splash, the Nationals are still the superior team.\nLet’s start by looking at each team’s lineups. The Braves' top of the lineup will likely consist of Andrelton Simmons, Jason Heyward and Justin Upton. This group has a lot of potential and talent, but there will be questions about consistency.\nThe Nationals on the other hand, have Denard Span, Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman leading things off. These guys have a lot of experience, but Werth and Zimmerman have been declining over the past two years. Span gives the Nationals a true leadoff hitter they’ve sorely needed.\nFreddie Freeman will be the cleanup hitter for the Braves, followed by B.J. Upton and Dan Uggla. The problem here is that Upton and Uggla are low-contact, high-strikeout hitters. However, with all of the opportunities they will get with men on base, expect the duo to have bounce-back seasons.\nThe Nationals have Adam LaRoche, Bryce Harper and Ian Desmond at the four, five and six spots. Washington chose LaRoche over Michael Morse, and for good reason. In each of his last two full seasons, LaRoche has had 100 RBI and over 60 extra-base hits.\nHarper has the highest upside out of any National, and will look to follow a solid rookie year with an electric sophomore campaign. Desmond had his best season last year, but the Nationals have to be a little concerned about his injury problems.\nWho Will Win the NL East This Season?\nThe seventh spot in each team’s lineup is rather strong. Brian McCann is widely regarded as one of the best offensive catchers in baseball, even if he had a disappointing season in 2012. Danny Espinosa strikes out a lot and has a low average, but he steals bases and has excellent power for a middle infielder.\nFinally, the Braves have a below-average hitter in Juan Francisco batting before the pitcher, and the Nationals have a promising catcher in Wilson Ramos.\nBoth lineups are amongst the best in the league. But while Atlanta is more of a streaky hitting team, the evolution of Harper will make the Nationals' lineup a threat to every pitcher they face.\nAdditionally, both teams have elite bullpens. Craig Kimbrel is one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball and is more than a formidable option for the Braves in the ninth inning. Jonny Venters and Eric O’Flaherty took a step back last year, but with the addition of fireballer Jordan Walden, the Braves' top relievers will be able to have more rest throughout the season.\nThe Nationals already had a late-inning combination of Drew Storen and Tyler Clippard before they signed Rafael Soriano. Now they boast three great right-handed relievers.\nThe problem with the Nationals' bullpen is that they don’t have an effective left-handed reliever, unless you want to count Zach Duke. The Braves, on the other hand, have a good mix of relievers that can handle any situation presented.\nHowever, the biggest advantage that either of these teams have on one another is the Nationals' starting pitching. Stephen Strasburg and Gio Gonzalez are already one of the top duos in the MLB; adding Dan Haren and Jordan Zimmermann to the mix gives Washington arguably the best starting rotation in the majors.\nThe Braves have Tim Hudson as their ace. Hudson has injury concerns, but he’s been a reliable pitcher over the past couple of seasons. Kris Medlen was a force for the Braves down the stretch last year; if the Braves have any chance of winning the NL East, they’ll need Medlen to maintain a similar performance.\nThe rest of the Braves' rotation includes Mike Minor, Paul Maholm and Julio Teheran. Those three certainly make the Braves' starting rotation weaker than the Nationals, even if Ross Detwiler is their fifth starter.\nThe Nationals simply have more talent and depth. Even though the Braves have a better bullpen, I think that Davey Johnson will manage his pen better than Fredi Gonzalez. This division race will be close, but the Nationals will pull away in the last few weeks of September.\nWhat is the duplicate article?\nWhy is this article offensive?\nWhere is this article plagiarized from?\nWhy is this article poorly edited?", "id": "<urn:uuid:ec1b674f-aa41-4b22-9c22-bd1347fe597d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1504498-washington-nationals-are-they-better-than-the-atlanta-braves", "date": "2013-05-18T07:29:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9560787677764893, "token_count": 978, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Seattle Seahawks: Did Russell Wilson and Bobby Wagner Deserve ROY Awards?\nOver the weekend, Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III and Carolina Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly won the NFL's Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards, while Seattle Seahawks Bobby Wagner and Russell Wilson finished in second and third place respectively in the voting done by the Associated Press.\nAs the Seattle Times' Danny O'Neil reported:\nSeattle’s draft class was panned in April. In January, though, Seattle had two of the top six rookies according to Associated Press ballots.\nLinebacker Bobby Wagner was runner-up in Defensive Rookie of the Year to Luke Kuechly of Carolina, the No. 9 overall pick. Kuechly received 28 first-place votes, Wagner 11. Green Bay cornerback Casey Hayward finished third with six first-place votes.\nQuarterback Russell Wilson was third in votes for Offensive Rookie of the Year. Robert Griffin III of Washington won the award, receiving 29 of 50 votes. Andrew Luck of Indianapolis received 11 votes, Wilson received 10.\nThe balloting by 50 designated voters concluded before the start of the postseason. Voters selected one winner. There were no second and third-place votes in balloting.\nWhile I'm not shocked that RG3 won the offensive award, I was a little surprised Kuechly beat out Wagner. In both votes what really has me scratching my head is the margin by which RG3 and Kuechly won.\nOn the offensive side of the coin the competition was fierce between not only the No. 1 and No. 2 selections in the April draft, but the man chosen 70-plus spots following them.\nIf you're a fan of the underdog, you will be hard-pressed to find a better story than Russell Wilson this season or most others. The undersized third-round draft choice took the city of Seattle and the NFL by storm in a story that now reads like a cheesy Hollywood script.\nThe fact of the matter is that it was really a fairly lengthy process that began last spring and took shape over the better part of the season. Wilson painstakingly won over his coaches, teammates, fans and eventually the entire league by taking on all comers and proving the critics wrong every step of the way.\nYet choosing among RG3, Andrew Luck, and Russell Wilson isn't as easy as you might imagine.\nWho deserved the Offensive ROY Award?\nAs much as I love Wilson, I can understand the appeal of RG3 and how voters were amazed by him from the very beginning to the very end.\nWho could forget RG3's Week 1 performance when he went to New Orleans and won with a dazzling display of dominance by attacking through the air and on the ground. Fast-forward to the regular-season finale at home against the Cowboys with the division title up for grabs when Griffin once again got the job done with the help of fellow rookie Alfred Morris at running back.\nBy the way, where were the ROY votes for Morris? A sixth-round pick from Florida Atlantic rushes for 1,613 yards with 13 touchdowns while helping his team to the playoffs and his teammate wins in a landslide while he doesn't get a single vote from the 50 writers?\nIt all leads me to believe that Griffin's knack for drama is what has the media and fans spellbound. It also leads me to believe it's part of why he stayed in the wild-card game against the Seahawks well past the point he should have.\nPatrick McDermott/Getty Images\nWilson, on the other hand, perhaps because he has been reminded throughout his life about his limitations, seems to have a solid grasp of what he should and shouldn't do on the field of play.\nThat maturity came through against the Redskins as he rallied the 'Hawks back on the road and leads me to wonder how many voters would have changed their vote if they had the chance now?\nOn the defensive side, Wagner was a second-round pick joining an already solid defense, but asked to help shore up what was arguably the team's weakest point at linebacker.\nFollowing the departure of veteran David Hawthorne via free agency, Wagner was drafted with the hopes of taking over the middle linebacker spot after the top middle linebacker in the draft was selected just a few spots ahead of the Seahawks' first-round pick.\nWhether the 'Hawks would have drafted Luke Kuechly is something we will probably never know, but with the Carolina Panthers grabbing him at No. 9, the brain trust of head coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider adjusted accordingly and eventually found their man in the middle in Round 2.\nA position that going in to the season looked like a potential liability soon became a strength, with Wagner always at the center of the action while leading the team in tackles playing alongside second-year man K.J. Wright and veteran Leroy Hill.\nWith that said, did Wagner deserve to win given his contributions to the Seahawks this season?\nWho Deserved the Defensive ROY Award?\nIn Carolina this season Kuechly posted 165 tackles and took over the middle linebacker spot after veteran Jon Beason went down for the season with an injury early in the season.\nAt the same time I don't see how Kuechly got 28 first-place votes versus only 11 for Wagner.\nAt times like these I can imagine some fans crying about an East Coast bias within the media, but I'm not sure how much I buy that here given the fact that the Seahawks had four first-team All-Pro selections this year.\nPerhaps in both cases Wilson and Wagner's success was seen as a byproduct of an already solid roster built by Pete Carroll and John Schneider?\nOnce again, we will probably never know, but by now Wilson and Wagner are likely accustomed to the critics looking past them. Either way I like to think both slights will be stowed away and some day used as motivation for Wilson and Wagner, who seem the kind of players who may forgive but will never forget.\nWinning rookie of the year may be nice, but I hope that both men have their sights set on something far more grandiose over the course of time, while helping lift the Seahawks to a level that no one will be able to deny them with a popular vote...a Super Bowl championship.\nWhat is the duplicate article?\nWhy is this article offensive?\nWhere is this article plagiarized from?\nWhy is this article poorly edited?", "id": "<urn:uuid:ba9ed54e-b45e-4214-8bd7-ff5123fcd5fb>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1516181-seattle-seahawks-did-russell-wilson-and-bobby-wagner-deserve-roy-awards", "date": "2013-05-18T06:02:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.977402925491333, "token_count": 1328, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Clutch Hitting and Strong Pitching Are Keys To First-Place Padres' Success\nAfter last night’s rally and dramatic bottom of the ninth victory, the Padres (17-10) assured themselves of having another successful homestand. Winners of six of their last eight games and 11-4 at home, the Padres continue to roll.\nOn the offensive side, the Padres are showing an ability to hit with runners in scoring position—they are second in the National League with a .293 team average. After collecting their third walk-off win of the season, they are also proving that they have the ability to come through when the game is on the line.\nShowing that he is a go-to-guy in the clutch, with two outs, Chase Headley, lined a 1-0 count single to the right-center gap, scoring Lance Zawadski from second base. This was Headley’s second walk-off hit of the season; the other walk-off hit for the Padres was a home run by David Eckstein.\nAside from the timely hitting, strong pitching has also been a major reason for their early season success—with a 2.81 team ERA that ranks second in the NL.\nLast night’s starting pitcher, Wade LeBlanc, called up to replace the injured Chris Young in the rotation, allowed two earned runs over six innings, received a no-decision.\nIn three other starts this season LeBlanc (2-0, 1.16) has only one earned run and has shown a lot of promise. LeBlanc was the pitcher of record in two of the Padres’ Major League leading six shutouts.\nOpening day starter and free-agent acquisition, Jon Garland (3-2, 2.06) has been a steady contributor.\nVeteran Kevin Correia (4-2, 3.97) leads the team in wins and strikeouts with 30.\nSecond-year starter Clayton Richard (1-2, 3.00) is beginning to hit his stride.\nThe only sore spot in the rotation has been 22-year-old Mat Latos (1-3, 5.47), who has given up a team-high seven home runs. All-star Heath Bell (2-0, 1.64) anchors a strong bullpen with seven saves in eight chances.\nIt is still too early to tell if the first-place Padres have what it takes to take the division. But the middle of May just might give a clue as whether or not the Padres are true contenders.\nIf they manage to come out with a winning record against the second-place Giants and are able to take advantage of the struggling Dodgers, who were early season favorites to win the division, then the Padres will most likely still be atop the division.\nAnd that may just be time to start taking the overachieving Padres seriously.\nWhat is the duplicate article?\nWhy is this article offensive?\nWhere is this article plagiarized from?\nWhy is this article poorly edited?", "id": "<urn:uuid:baab14c8-8df5-43be-91e5-6529f9d118e3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/388553-clutch-hitting-and-strong-pitching-keys-to-first-place-padres-success", "date": "2013-05-18T05:51:29Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9642255902290344, "token_count": 630, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Daryl Johnston: Understanding Roles of Our FBs in the Chargers Offense\nI got into a little debate with a Raider fan a long time ago. The debate was based on a article I wrote awhile back appropriately named \"Pick Your Poison: A Look at the 2010 Chargers Offensive Arsenal\". In that article, I named Jacob Hester and Mike Tolbert as part of the Chargers offensive weapons. This Raider fan, from what I gather, didn't know much about the Chargers offense, so I decided to write this article on why these guys are weapons.\nIf there is ever a indication of what Tolbert and Hester's worth to the Chargers offense, we'll have to take a step back in time to the first player that made that position what it is today. That player is Daryl Johnston.\nIf it wasn't for Daryl Johnston, there would be no FB vote in the Pro Bowl today. What he did was nothing short of extraordinary as he was one of the most dynamic players in the game.\nDynamic, not versatile.\nPeople get those two words confused all the time. He wasn't lined up all over the place but what he did was pass-block, run-block, run with the ball, and catch the ball out of the backfield. That's dynamic.\nWhy can I look at Daryl Johnston as a indication of what Tolbert and Hester can hopefully be? Because the one person that orchestrated the Cowboys offense in which Daryl Johnston flourished in is none other than the current Head Coach for the San Diego Chargers.\nJohnston was a ordinary FB during his first two years in the NFL. Turner came in and turned him into a viable weapon in the passing game or running game whether he's the runner, pass-catching receiver, or blocker.\nDuring Turner's time as the offensive coordinator, he installed his version of the Vertical Offense. Johnston had 54 yards rushing , averaging 3.2 yards per carry, and 28 receptions for 244 yards in his first season. During his second season, he improved in the new offense with 61 yards rushing, averaging 3.6 yards per carry, and 32 receptions for 249 yards. In his third season, he went on to have 74 rushing yards, averaging 3.1 yards per carry, and 50 receptions for 372 yards.\nHe wasn't the main weapon on the Cowboys offense, but he was the person that made everyone better. He gave the QB extra time. He helped a young Emmitt Smith gained massive amounts of yardage in the running game. He helped the Cowboys move the ball in the passing game.\nThese are the same attributes that can be found in both Tolbert and Hester for the San Diego Chargers. If you look at what they did in a combined effort in the FB position, you can see how Turner is using them to help the Chargers offense move the ball in much of the same way Turner helped the Cowboys move the ball.\nBoth Tolbert and Hester been in the league for two seasons, all with the Chargers. Both Tolbert and Hester combined at the FB position had 132 yards rushing, averaging 4.1 yards per carry, and 25 receptions for 262 yards in their first season. In their second season together, Tolbert and Hester combined for 222 yards rushing, averaging 4.8 yards per carry, and 26 receptions for 216 yards.\nNow, you can see that the Chargers FB's play a important role on the team in being very dynamic. It gives the Chargers a lot more options during a game. Defenses might look at the RB, TE, and WR of the Chargers only to neglect their FB as a viable threat to keep the drive alive. This is what the FB's can do for the Chargers.\nIt's still early in both Mike Tolbert and Jacob Hester's career, but after seeing what Daryl Johnston did in Turner's offense, I think it's safe to say that both Tolbert and Hester are just as much weapons to their team as Johnston was to his.\nWhat is the duplicate article?\nWhy is this article offensive?\nWhere is this article plagiarized from?\nWhy is this article poorly edited?", "id": "<urn:uuid:ce0be061-7187-4e43-903f-f91d885dd7f4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/443070-daryl-johnston-understanding-roles-of-our-fbs-in-the-vertical-offense", "date": "2013-05-18T08:04:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9831854701042175, "token_count": 842, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

I think they will crush Boise State!!!\nGo Green when they aren't playing my team and Go Blue!!!!\nHi Ken, thanks for posting on my bulletin board. Sorry that I just saw this tonight. I'm not always following everything on BR these days.\nIn any case, I've always enjoyed our trips to Michigan State. I have found the fans to be quite welcoming and friendly to Penn Staters, and the stadium atmosphere to be outstanding, albeit a bit tough to get up to that nosebleed section - 7 ramps! - where they put the away game fans these days. I also think that MSU's campus is one of the prettiest in the Big Ten.\nIn any case I guess since now we are in different divisions we won't play one another quite as often. So when we do, it will be more special. I never hide my garb anywhere in the Big Ten, and have never really had a problem. But I understand why you go out of your way at Ohio State to hide the fact that you're from Michigan.\nThanks for the message Ken. I think running those types of plays would be great. I think it's good too because it's not likely that there would be injuries to the QB. I think throwing in a play like that each quarter would be great as well. It would keep the defense honest and make passing and running plays easier for us. I think Having Denard throwing to Gardner, and Gardner throwing back to Denard on a screen would almost get a TD every time since Denard is so fast and elusive.\nMichigan looks great on paper. They have a ton of great players. I think they will do great under Coach Hoke and Mattison, however the schedule they play this year is brutal. If they can pull out wins on their road games, (@Nebraska, Alabama in Texas, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Minnesota, and Purdue) then I think they will have a shot at another BCS bowl game and perhaps a chance at going to the Big Ten Championship game. I sure hope you're right about this being Michigan's year.\nI recently came across your blog and have been reading along. I thought I would leave my first comment. I don't know what to say except that I have enjoyed reading. Nice blog. I will keep visiting this blog very often.\nEssay Writing Help|Research Paper Help|Essay Writers|Cheap Essays|Help Me Write An Essay|Custom Research Paper Online Help|Free Essays Online|Order An Essay Online|Buy Persuasive Essays Online|Admission Essays Writing Service Online\nI def dont think ur a bad guy, lol...i spent some time looking for that quote but ill def give ur friend a shout and get the scoop...lol....roll tide!!\nI thought you might want to check out \"The Top 25 Title Odds\" story. I think you'll get a kick out of my picks to make the finals.\nKen... I fully and totally understand you not wanting me to have your email address. If you want to keep in touch through B/R that is fine with me. But, if you ever want to get in touch with me on a more personal level, you can always email me at firstname.lastname@example.org. It is a strange time in the world right now so I won't be upset in any way, shape, or form if you would rather keep in touch through B/R. Hell...it surely is easy enough and my email alerts me any time I get any kind of message from B/R. I may be wrong, but I consider you smart,and even though you are a fan of \"little brother\", I consider you a friend as well. I wish all of the people at B/R were like you and the handful of friends I have at B/R. I have a couple Michigan pals, a Wisconsin buddy, you, and about a dozen Buckeye friends although they aren't very bright for the most part and DO NOT have my email address. Hahahaha. Anyway...you are now my brother whether you like it or not (I call all men, \"brother\"... it is a Christian thing). And on a couple personal notes... I'm 38 years old. I was born in Dayton, Ohio, just like friggin Brady Hoke, and I have lived in the Orlando, Florida area for around 30 years. My birthday is on February, 25th so I turn 39 then, In keeping with \"Things about Chris\"... I am married with 2 daughters (12 and 9), but I have been separated for 7 years. I live with my girlfriend, Wendy, and her 2 children. Wendy's boy has Down's syndrome and is 28. Wendy's daughter is a senior in high school and is 18. We honestly have 26 cats (no joke). We took in a couple pregnant strays and then 8 months later we went from 12 cats to 38 cats. Since we would never let someone kill our pets, we take between 1 and 4 cats to the \"no kill\" animal shelter every 2 to 4 weeks. We also have 2 rabbits as we are animal lovers but the cats were an accident of sorts that our laziness made things bad. Wendy and I are both plumbers that specialize in total home re-piping. But since we are in a depression of sorts, Wendy has taken a job doing housekeeping at a nearby hotel and I am doing very little part-time plumbing just to barely get by. We used to make $1200 to $2500 each weekly for a four day week, but now we are living week to week. Times have been very tough to say the least.\nSo, now you know about my family and me. I'm just a sports freak and not too much of a weirdo. You told me about your job so I went a bit overboard and told you nearly everything about me and us. Oh... one last thing... we are Christians but we aren't Bible banging freaks. You never have to worry about me getting upset about any words you speak. I'm just a normal dude that believes in Christ but I don't attend church or practice any funky rituals. I'm a weirdo, but I'm normal at the same time. Email me through B/R or through my regular email anytime you wish. Your emails and your sports views will always be taken in pleasure. Take care, brother, I hope to hear from you before the last game of the Big Ten basketball season.

{"text": "And Now We Return to Wednesday’s Originally Scheduled Broadcast\nAs I mentioned before, my original plan on Wednesday was to discuss some of the topics covered in Tuesday’s Winter Meeting interviews with Angels’ GM Tony Reagins and Angels Manager Mike Scioscia. That was before the Crawford deal, before the Angels signed Scott Downs, before…well, suffice to say a lot has happened in the four and a half days since those interviews, rendering much of what was said irrelevant at this point. However, a few pieces of news remain pertinent and interesting:\nSince about late August or so, all reports have indicated that Kendry is making great progress at or slightly ahead of schedule and that he should be able to return for the 2011 season as good as new. On the one hand, this is what you would expect the front office to say but, on the other hand, if his progress was cause for concern I tend to think the easier route would just be to avoid giving frequent updates all together. During the Tuesday interviews, Scioscia and Reagins both reiterated that Kendry is making excellent progress and let us know he has been able to resume light baseball activities in addition to the regular rehab and workouts. Scioscia also said that while they will watch Kendry cautiously in the beginning, of course, based on his current progress he should be “full-go for all drills”* by the beginning of Spring Training.\nKendry Morales is one of my favorite players – a guy who can motivate the whole team with a swing of his mighty bat or a great play at first. Honestly, this news makes me happier than a big trade or signing announcement would make me…not that I didn’t want that big announcement too. I’m greedy like that. Having Kendry back in and of itself will be a huge improvement in the Angels offense, but all of the major players involved have promised us repeatedly that they would not be content with just having Kendry back in the line-up and would make one or two additional improvements for 2011. This promise has noticeably not been repeated since Crawford signed with the Red Sox and, while I sincerely hope this is not the case, I am left with one of Ash’s great lines from Army of Darkness stuck in my head. Oh that’s just what we call pillow talk, baby, that’s all.\nCatchers’ Tango Turned Broadway Ensemble Dance Routine\nMike Scioscia said that with Kendry on the mend, Mike Napoli would be returning to his role as catcher in 2011 in the typically glowing way we have all come to expect when Scioscia talks about Napoli behind the plate. “I think he’s a catcher, and he thinks he’s a catcher. Now he needs to go out a catch like he’s a catcher.” Clearly by returning to his role a catcher, Scioscia meant returning to the two and occasionally three and even four way bare knuckled, albeit good naturedly so, brawl for a permanent position behind the plate. Of the catching position, Scioscia said, “It’s obviously an important position for us. Jeff is more skilled defensively. Bobby is a combination. Hank Conger is coming. We have some depth there.” Mike Scioscia, King of Understatement. Of course, this could also be so much pillow talk and Napoli could very well be trade bait for the bat we so desperately need. Given the fact that the Angels’ 2010 homerun leader is often, himself, the bat we so desperately need, albeit a very streaky one, unless such a trade brings additional sizable tangible benefits, this doesn’t make nearly as much sense to me as other deals might.\nAccording to Scioscia, Kaz’ new offseason conditioning program seems to be working. He is showing marked improvements in stamina and control and is still expected to be the 5th starter in 2011. This is the kind of news I really hope is true and not just the thing the team is expected to say. It’s hard not to respect and root for a player who is possibly more upset by his poor performance than even the fans and who busts his butt in the offseason to try and make sure it doesn’t happen again. If Kaz could be as good as he was for the Rays, as good as he started out for us in 2009…Wow! The Angels starting rotation would truly be a thing of beauty, wouldn’t it?\n* All of the interview quotations were taken from Lyle Spencer’s articles “Scioscia Sees a Bright Future for Trout” and “Lee Joins High-Profile List Linked to Angels.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:4997180c-88a3-4aeb-bceb-bb5cf9a5f22c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blithescribe.mlblogs.com/2010/12/12/and-now-we-return-to-wednesdays-originally-scheduled-broadcast/?like=1&_wpnonce=67418a1937", "date": "2013-05-18T05:58:22Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.97530198097229, "token_count": 990, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "Finding a position that’s comfortable and supportive is important for beginning meditation. Remaining completely still for any period of time is difficult for most Americans, and if you’re uncomfortable, it makes it even harder.\nIf you’re just starting out with meditation, don’t feel like you have to twist yourself up like a pretzel. A simple posture will provide just as much benefit.\nIn Buddhist philosophy, the mind, body, and breath are intricately connected. How you sit will affect the quality of your breathing and your mental focus.\nKeeping your back straight with good posture is important no matter which meditation position you choose. This allows the diaphragm to move freely as you breathe more deeply. If you are sitting on the floor, you may need a pillow (called a zafu) to raise your buttocks and help you keep your body upright with very little effort.\nSitting in a chair is the simplest way to begin your meditation practice. It’s also the best option for individuals who suffer from back pain or other discomfort that makes sitting on the floor difficult. Keep your feet flat on the floor. Use a backrest if needed, but keep your body upright and your back straight. You can use a zafu pillow behind your back to help your posture, or you can sit on the front third of the zafu in the same you would use it on the floor.\nSitting on the floor helps you feel more grounded and stable. Meditation cushions such as a zafu and zabuton can make sitting on the floor more comfortable. Use the zafu to raise your hips and make it easier to keep your body upright. Sit on the front third of the zafu cushion. You can either sit with your knees bent in a kneeling position with the zafu under you (seiza position) or with your legs crossed in front of you and both feet on the floor, in the Burmese position.\nThe Burmese, half Lotus, and Lotus positions require flexibility. Only attempt to sit in these positions if you can do so comfortably. Otherwise they may interfere with your ability to meditate.\nPhoto Credits: Kanzeon Zen Center on Flickr", "id": "<urn:uuid:c11e1b5a-b3af-4b3c-a8ae-55e8aa855ba7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.1massagestore.com/tag/meditation-cushion/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:30:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9268646836280823, "token_count": 458, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "Discussions about faith-work integration are on the rise, with an ever-increasing number of related books, sermons, and blog posts (ahem) appearing with every passing day.\nJust a cursory glance around the faith and work landscape, and you’ll find a bunch of middle class white men (with the occasional woman or Asian). So what’s going on here? Does integrating your faith and work only matter for white professionals and not African-Americans or Latinos? (For the sake of this post, you’ll have to excuse some generalizations.)\nAfter offering a brief history of 20th-century American prosperity and the widespread self-actualization that followed, Haanen offers his hypothesis:\nTwentieth century America did not bless all ethnic groups evenly with wealth and comfort. African Americans lived under the thumb of institutionalized racism even years after the civil rights movement, and struggled for years to acquire the kind of jobs, and thus material comfort, that their white counterparts did. Today, it’s mostly Latinos who occupy the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder; they make even less than blacks per capita across age groups.\nAll that to say this: while white guys were wondering about their purpose in life, blacks and Latinos were just trying to survive. When I was a pastor of a Latino congregation, it wasn’t terribly surprising that questions of existential despair or vocational fit never arose. Dignity and providing for the family trumped “fulfilling the cultural mandate.” Getting a job and paying rent was a bit higher on the hierarchy of needs.\nHaanen’s point about disparate shifts in the makeup and distribution of work is an important one. The minimum-wage McDonald’s worker will likely face a host of spiritual challenges distinct from those faced by the white-collar executive. Likewise, the differences in time and comfort outside of that work will play no small part in defining that struggle. As Haanen also indicates, “intangible” factors like racism are bound to transform these struggles further, even among workers in the same job type and industry.\nBut having recognized all of this, it’s also important to recognize that just because a worker hasn’t the time, resources, or energy for armchair theologizing on “vocational fit,” it doesn’t mean that meaning, purpose, and transcendent activity isn’t taking place amid the strenuous circumstances. Whether or not we are actively thinking and talking about “cultural mandate,” the basic dignity of our work and the basic activity of serving society and providing for one’s family is an integral part of fulfilling that mandate. At a certain level, “needs-based” work has a forceful way of tempering our individualistic inclinations, and at that level, I think we need to seriously reconsider how closely we’re aligning “vocation” with our own personal preferences or our end-game goals. Does God not also call us to that initial job or task that begins a longer trajectory filled with other more “fulfilling” things?

{"text": "Multi-Channel Retailing Today and Tomorrow\nFebruary 1, 2013 Leave a comment\nWhen I attended the National Retail Federation conference a couple of weeks ago, there was a session on “Exhibitor Big Ideas” dedicated to what global consumers say they really want in a multi-channel world, based on a 2012 study by NCR. The research was very enlightening about the current state of retail and the preferences of today’s consumers.\nThe study mapped what consumers look for and like with against retailers are actually offering and there is a lot of room for retailers to improve. In fact, retail will change more in the next five years than it has in the past 20 years.\nWhen it comes to personalized coupon offers:\n- 69% of consumers worldwide would welcome them.\n- 73% of shoppers said the availability of electronic coupons is a must-have for them.\n- 27% of grocery retail locations provide personalized offers.\n- 46% of favorite grocery retailers offer electronic coupons (“favorites” were a specific sub-set of retailers cited by respondents)\n- Overall, 35% of U.S. retailers offer them but 80% of American consumers want them.\n2. Buy anywhere, get anywhere\nShoppers expect a connected or converged experience. They want to feel like they are dealing with the same business in-store, online, in mobile apps, etc. Brick and mortar stores must embrace that consumers are using technology. For many, the internet has become the shopping channel of choice. Retail has gone from a B2C to a C2B experience.\nFor each company, all of the pricing strategies, policies and procedures have to look and work the same. The best way to accomplish this is to put the right platforms in to manage the entire ecosystem versus managing all of them individually.\n- 78% of shoppers in North America want to purchase anywhere and get merchandise shipped or picked up anywhere.\n- 82% of favorite retailers in North America offer the option but 26% did not.\nThere are some interesting developments happening. Retailers are creating multiple channels for returns. It’s good they are doing this because expensive or lengthy return policies and procedures were reasons for not making purchases for 76% of consumers.\nRetailers have to think about getting creative because there are many opportunities to think outside the box. For example, Sears had a drive-through window for returns after the holidays.\n3. In-Store Self-Service\nMost grocery stores have some self-service options but there is opportunity to incorporate this approach across all retail categories. Even in grocery, many retailers have self-service in the front lanes but not enough help around the store. Consumers want independence and control of their shopping experience.\n- Nearly 20% of retailers provide in-store self-service\n- However, 44% of North American consumers desired increased in-store self-service options.\nApple consumers can walk in, buy accessories and walk out without speaking or engaging with store associates.\n4. Consumer Mobile\nRetailers have to do mobile right and consumers love it when they do. The experience should be clean, fast and positive. Furthermore, it has to be timely. When it works, the adoption rate will be strong and fast. From mobile apps and offers to research and payment—there is no end to the trend.\nRegarding mobile scan and pay:\n- 52% of consumers want mobile scan and pay\n- Only 12% of their favorite grocery stores offer (because it is tough to implement and there are operational considerations).\nRetailers who drive this feature early may actually get consumers to switch their loyalties. Even if retailers decide they want to hang back and join this trend late, they should start soon in the next one to three years because consumers will demand this feature.\nMobile can be a win-win.\n- Consumers are using technology for faster checkout and personalized offers. They also use it to monitor spending.\n- Retailers get valuable insight into purchasing behavior, store utilization/traffic patterns and can influence shoppers at the point of decisions with targeted offers. On top of that, scan and pay is a huge opportunity.\nStepping back to look at the big picture, time is the biggest problem retailers can solve for consumers. And they are getting more impatient. They digest technology really quickly. So if “Big Brother” is smart, he will be successful.\nUltimately, retailers have to remember that the consumer is in charge. Purchasing used to be a straight line of activity. Now there are lines all over the place in the C2B experience. The best advice for retailers is to think of all the points of contact, look at their technology architecture and centralize to deliver what consumers want, as well as how and where they want.\nWhat makes certain retailers “favorites” for you and what multi-channel options do you value most?", "id": "<urn:uuid:984b591f-eb63-40cd-b8a0-789c989055fb>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.affinityexpress.com/2013/02/01/multichannel-retailing-today-and-tomorrow/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9559429883956909, "token_count": 1012, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "8 June 2012: A new charity to provide holidays for recovering armed service families has been launched by former Secretary of State for Defence the Right Honourable Dr Liam Fox MP.\nIn partnership with Afghan Heroes, the registered charity set up by the mothers of soldiers killed in Afghanistan, this new initiative is called ‘Give Us Time’.\nThe idea is to provide families of those recovering from trauma of combat to adjust in a neutral and quality environment. It will apply to those who have lost a loved one, those who have suffered physical injury and those who suffer from the mental stress of combat.\nDr Fox said: “During my time as Secretary of State for Defence I was extremely heartened to see how we improved the treatment of those who had been physically injured in combat.\n“Medical improvements in prosthetics, better physiotherapy and improved social attitudes all contributed to a better chance of rehabilitation. In terms of psychological trauma – the invisible scars of war – we are making progress, though perhaps at a slower rate.\n“One of the areas where I think there remains room for improvement is the integration of service families into this equation.\n“As a doctor working with the Armed Forces I learned the importance of seeing our personnel, not as isolated individuals, but as members of a wider family and community dynamic.\n“Give Us Time has been made possible thanks to generously donated week-long holidays in second homes, holiday homes and timeshares across the UK and beyond.\n“We now look forward to helping those returning from active service recover through this scheme.\n“We are launching the property registration part of our website on Monday 11th June and we will trial the system throughout the rest of 2012, rolling it out more extensively in 2013. We aim to launch the armed service family part of the website in September this year.”\nDenise Harris, founder of Afghan Heroes added: “When we launched Afghan Heroes, one of our main objectives was to provide support for families of the fallen and those returning from theatre.\n“I know through personal experience how difficult it can be for those who have suffered loss or injury to recover. Give Us Time is a fantastic initiative and will go a long way to help those who have put their lives on the line readjust to a normal civilian life.”\nThis launch has been made possible by various partner organisations who have kindly donated their valuable time and resources, including Serco, VenueDirectory.com, Fanatic, and Cobweb.\nIssued on behalf of Give Us Time and Afghan Heroes by Empica Ltd.

{"text": "Two Mobile-based television stations have been off one of southwest Alabama's largest cable providers for a month now, and it remained unknown whether the underlying contractual dispute will be resolved anytime soon.\nAt the end of August, the programming of WALA, a Fox affiliate, and WFNA, a CW affiliate, disappeared from the Mediacom cable lineup. The blackout is part of a larger dispute between LIN Media, which owns the stations, and Mediacom, which carries the programming of LIN stations in a number of markets around the country.\nMediacom pays LIN for the right to rebroadcast its programming. A contract between the two companies expired on Aug. 5, and they have not come to terms on a new deal. The resulting standoff also affects several stations in Indiana, Virginia, Michigan and Wisconsin.\nThe two companies' rhetoric, which was fairly bland as the blackout loomed, has grown somewhat more forceful in the interim.\nWALA's website, www.fox10tv.com, carries a statement saying that LIN has \"tried hard to reach an agreement\" and is \"disappointed in the outcome of our negotiations, especially since we have successfully reached deals with every major cable, satellite and telecommunications company that recognizes our fair market value.\"\nMediacom, meanwhile, offered viewers a statement that says the company \"won't cave-in to demands for outrageous rate increases\" by LIN and that it has \"a duty to our customers\" to fight for a deal that keeps costs reasonable for Mediacom patrons.\nThe site also carried an aggrieved letter from Mediacom Chairman and CEO Rocco B. Commisso to Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, arguing that the FCC has been too passive in such disputes.\nMediacom described the blackout as an uncivil \"pressure tactic\" that undermines good-faith negotiations. The WALA statement held that \"by law, Mediacom no longer has the right to carry our programming.\"\nDespite the tough talk, representatives for both sides said Thursday that negotiations were ongoing.\n\"We are continuing to negotiate with Mediacom and have been negotiating with Mediacom, frankly, since even before last April,\" said Elden Hale, general manager of WALA and WFNA, who added that he was not personally involved in the talks. He said the contract actually ended in April, but both parties had agreed to extensions through August.\n\"We have noticed from our customers a lot of support,\" he said. \"A lot of our viewers have told us that they are seeking alternative pay TV providers, so we've been really encouraged by the support we're seeing.\"\nTom Larsen, vice president of legal and public affairs for Mediacom, said that on the channels where it once showed LIN stations, Mediacom has occasionally been showing free previews of the NFL Network, the Big 10 Network and Starz Family in some markets, and in some cases making other special offers to subscribers who are upset by the blackout.\n\"We're continuing to negotiate with LIN,\" he said. \"We sent them a proposal last week, and we're waiting on them to respond to that proposal.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:03acb7b1-1e3e-43d6-8be5-9c3b766111ed>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.al.com/entertainment-press-register/2011/09/month-old_cable_dispute_drags.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:33:10Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.974894106388092, "token_count": 654, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "On Oct 1, 2012, the Perth Mint in Australia released the latest issue of a popular Gold bullion series: the 2013 Australian Gold Kangaroo. Much like the previous releases in this series, these Gold Kangaroos are issued as Australian legal tender and guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government of Australia.\nThe 2013 Australian Gold Kangaroos are offered in sizes of 1/10 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz and 1 oz, as well as the larger 1 kilo size. The smaller sizes (1/10 oz to 1 oz) have limited mintages of no more than 350,000, depending on size, which gives them high numismatic value. Their worldwide distribution facilitates easy purchase and liquidation, making them good investment pieces, as well.\nThe Australian Gold Kangaroos have been offered by the Perth Mint since 1989 and are one of the few Gold bullion coins to change its reverse design each year. This year’s issue depicts a kangaroo standing against the Australian outback. The kilo coin differs slightly, in that the image is instead a hopping Red Kangaroo. The “P” mint mark appears on the reverse of each coin, along with the inscriptions “Australian Kangaroo,” the date, size of the coin, and the purity, “9999 Gold.” The obverse of each coin shows the Ian Rank-Broadley likeness of Queen Elizabeth II, as well as the coin’s monetary denomination.\nThe Perth Mint opened in 1899, originally serving as a branch of Britain’s Royal Mint to help supply Gold sovereigns and half sovereigns, which were used as everyday circulating coins throughout the British Empire. In 1970, control of the mint passed from Britain to the Western Australian Government, which still owns it today.\nTo add these beautiful coins to your collection or your investment portfolio, shop APMEX’s selection of 2013 Australian Gold Kangaroo bullion coins.

{"text": "There are not many Thanksgiving horror movies. It’s like the forgotten holiday of spooky splatter films.\nWe sent the SML Haunted Mansion and Blog Laboratory minions to find a Thanksgiving themed horror movie all the monsters could enjoy. We expected them to bring back “Home Sweet Home” or “Thankskilling.” But we forgot how unreliable minions can be.\nInstead, our underlings brought us 1972’s “Blood Freak” – a grindhouse film about a half-man-half-turkey who goes on a pot-fueled rampage against drug dealers, thirsting for their chemical-addled blood.\nDear minions, we couldn’t be more proud.\nThe movie features a Vietnam vet who returns home to get involved with a group of junkies and drug dealers. One of the girls gets him a job with her mad scientist father, who turns him into a turkey-man, and horrific hilarity ensues.\nThe director must have been in love with the lead actor because the opening credits feature actor Steve Hawkes’ name three times. The director is easy to spot because he makes frequent cameos throughout the film. He appears in an unbuttoned silk shirt with flower print and chain smoking while giving Public Service Announcements about the dangers of drugs. You don’t see this technique used very often.\nWe assumed the cheap Vincent Price mustache the director wore was an homage to the classic horror films of the past generation. And his heavy-handed Twilight Zone-like introduction must have been his attempt to tap into that classic television format.\nHowever, the director’s attempt to use a classic horror/sci-fi format ended there. The dialogue was riddled with groovy early 1970s slang – “right on,” “gone,” and “putting me on.”\nThis film was not afraid to break all the taboos, like scenes where actors eat roast turkey in front of live turkeys. And real scenes of fowl slaughter. Now that’s just sad. We aren’t vegetarians, but show some class. If PETA had been around in the early 70s, we are sure they would have been calling Mister Faux-Vincent-Price director night and day.\nAlso, a groovy chick makes love with the turkey man in the bedroom of a flophouse. Talk about being “Far Out.” Oh, and don’t worry about the man who gets his leg cut off with the power saw. He was already an amputee in real life.\nThis movie made us realize how thankful we should be this holiday season. We are thankful that we were not born turkeys, that there is no crazed turkey man going after our chemically-enhanced blood, and that our mad scientist father works with bears instead.\nView “Blood Freak” with your loved ones this Thanksgiving, and next year you’ll have the holiday all to yourself. Enjoy.\n~Film Review by Jim and Sarah of StuffMonstersLike.com\nGetting into the zombie mode? We are too.\nThe best zombie flicks have a little bit of laughter, a lot-a-bit of gore, and maybe even a tad of social commentary. Here are some movie suggestions to watch this October before you become the living dead on October 22 at the Asheville Zombie Walk.\n10) Dead Snow – Yes. This movie is Norwegian. That means there are subtitles. And yes. It is a movie about teens becoming trapped in a ski lodge and fighting off the living dead.\nBut did we mention the zombies from “Dead Snow” are leftover Nazis? If you thought regular zombies were mean, try watching the living dead who have sworn an allegiance to the Fuhrer.\n9) Fido – This movie was a total financial flop. And it’s Canadian. But it gives a fresh take on the old zombie tale by providing some “biting” social commentary via a 1950’s-esque landscape. There was a zombie apocalypse and the humans won. But in this alternative universe, sometimes the zombies are more humane than the humans.\n8.) Re-Animator - A classic low-budget horror movie about a scientist who possesses the secret of life and death. If you cannot imagine a B-Movie actor more schmaltzy and over-the-top than Bruce Campbell, then this movie is for you. But be warned, this gory film is definitely not for the squeamish.\n7) Return of the Living Dead – This 1985 movie is full of 1980’s hair and fashion. For some, that’s a great thing. For others, we feel it’s best forgotten. This flick features a lot of bad and unknown actors fighting against re-animated corpses. But this means they act poorly and are very good at looking confused. That’s very fitting. If anything, this movie’s claim to fame is that it started the whole trend of zombies who moan for “BRAINS.”\n6) Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town – Okay. We admit it. We have never seen this movie before. But with a title like that, it has to be “awfully” good.\n5) Shaun of the Dead – Usually, zombie movies and romantic comedies don’t go hand-in-hand. But this one pulls off the awkward amalgamation just fine. A bumbling store clerk loses his girlfriend and gets caught up in the zombie onslaught of his city. With help from his clueless roommate and pretentious friends, he attempts to save his loved ones from impending doom. If you haven’t seen this movie, get thee to the DVD rental store now. Your life is incomplete.\n4) 28 Days Later – Some argue if this is really a zombie movie because the dead are not rising from the grave. There is an infection turning living people into zombies. Again, this movie demonstrates that sometimes, humans can be more vicious and malignant than the living dead. In America, it’s easy to kill zombies. Just grab the nearest shotgun. But this movie takes place in England where guns are banned. Uh oh. That’s a problem. Your best defense against zombies in Great Britain is running shoes. Because in 28 Days Later, the zombies can run very, very fast.\n3) Zombieland – Got a craving for Twinkies? We do, and if you watch this movie, you will too. A rag-tag group bands together to battle the zombie forces destroying the Earth. The movie ends with a zombie swarm quickly taking over an abandoned amusement park. And who could forget the cameo from a Saturday Night Live Alumnus that is truly hilarious and tragic?\n2) Night of the Living Dead (Original) - This 1968 movie by Director George Romero is the original, the best, the quintessential, the ultimate, the classic by which all other zombie movies are judged. It started the craze of flesh eating zombies from beyond the grave, taking movies about the living dead to new levels of terror. So, why is it number two on this list. . . ?\n1) . . . Because we are having Ashtoberfest and the zombie walk at a mall, that’s why. And that brings us to our number one zombie movie:\nDawn of the Dead (original). A great Romero zombie flick from 1978. Zombies take over a mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania. There are biker battles and blood and plenty of biting. It was our inspiration for this year’s zombie swarm in Asheville. If you haven’t seen this movie, you’re missing out. The rest of us will be enjoying the awesome homage to this film on October 22 at the Biltmore Square “Maul.”\n~Written by Jim and Sarah, creators of StuffMonstersLike.com", "id": "<urn:uuid:df5e550f-d2d6-422b-8fc4-e3e823934aa8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.ashtoberfest.com/tag/movies/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:49:08Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9386080503463745, "token_count": 1657, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "If I hear one more time how Macs are expensive and just for fashion victims, I'll throw up. This urban myth keeps coming up for so long, that it's not really funny any more. These two statements that Macs are a) expensive and b) merely a fashion statement, are so easily debunked if one cares to look objectively for the truth that it's mind-boggling to see them come around so often. From personal experience, the (a) above is a farce. It is most ironic, that I mainly hear this from people who spend quite a lot on computers and tech gadgets in general. Like they are quite happy to shell out hundreds of euros for doubtful upgrades on PC hardware and assorted gizmos, but when contemplating a different platform altogether they become Ebenezer Scrooge.\nWhen I picked a locally-assembled PC with Ubuntu for my desktop at work, I did it for two reasons. First, to save a little extra cash, since the budget was low and second, to keep up with developments on FLOSS desktops in general, since I already had a Mac at home. Both systems would work equally well for what I do at work. Now, the purchase savings from getting the PC, amounted to what I cost the company per day. Having spent about a day fiddling with driver's and software that was not readily available through synaptic (that was in Edgy if memory serves), that advantage was gone. I pretty much knew this was going to happen from the start. However, the second reason still holds. I believe that the inevitable progress in FLOSS desktop systems is eventually going to make proprietary products pointlessly expensive. Ubuntu's polish in each new version attests to this. However we are not there yet.\nThe \"fashion\" argument (b) is even worse. It might have had some merit in the nineties, when Apple was floundering and targeted mainly the publishing and multimedia markets, but as anyone can see today things have changed. Are all the Mac-carrying uber-hackers in large conferences fashion victims? Really? Those guys with the pony-tails, beards, glasses, t-shirts, shorts and slippers? Funny how they don't seem to spend much on clothes.\nActually, what people like Yakov Fain are really afraid of, is change. And that's perfectly OK. I'm afraid of change, too. Otherwise I might have moved already. Or changed jobs. Or get divorced. Um, nope, scratch that one. It's just that, occasionally, I do manage to build up the courage to face something foreign and exotic and learn to live with it. And sometimes even learn to like it. For someone like Fain who has spent most of his time in the Windows world, every other world will appear difficult to learn. I have a friend (hi George!) whose first computer was a SPARCstation. When he started using Windows, years later, the experience seemed weird and clunky. It's the same thing, only on the flip side of the coin.\nAlso, Mark Pilgrim's latest mocking of MySQL installation on Mac OS X while hilarious (which is why I like his blog), is unfair. Sam Ruby's too. Installing or upgrading MySQL on OS X is just a matter of getting the package from the vendor's site and launching it, not compiling from sources. The fact that there might be no package yet for Leopard or that the current package does not function well on it is utterly irrelevant. It will be fixed. Ubuntu is no different. I updated Firefox on my Mac at home the day 22.214.171.124 was shipped, yet one week later my Ubuntu box at work is still at 126.96.36.199. Of course, it will be fixed.\nThis is what you lose with centralized package repositories, in order to gain consistency and ease of upgrading. I'm no stranger to this kind of thing, having used FreeBSD and Linux as my main desktop for many years now. If you think installing things in Ubuntu is always as easy as launching Synaptic, try to use Skype on amd64. Or Flash and Adobe Reader pre-Gutsy. I'm quite used to watching compiler output scroll for hours so all of it was a walk in the park for me, but I can imagine how it might have been frustrating for someone less experienced. Ubuntu's (and FreeBSD's, Fedora's, etc.) advantage over the Mac is when installing something not packaged specifically for OS X by the vendor, like mutt or nmap. That is where the value of a community-maintained repository shines. Of course you can use MacPorts / Fink / pkgsrc / whatever, but they are not integrated into the system, so you merely moved the goal post a little further.\nAs a parting thought, I have a confession to make: I'd love to work with this guy. Interacting with human beings requires a set of skills that not many people in the technology world can brag about. Understanding how humans work and what makes them tickle is fundamentally different than being an expert with machines and software. Michael Lopp is an engineering manager at Apple. It figures, I guess.\nMonday, November 19, 2007\nFriday, November 2, 2007\nI've tried both one Scriptaculous wrapper and the gwt-fx codebase and I would wholeheartedly recommend the latter. For starters, it feels like things are done \"the GWT way\": a single EffectPanel to decorate the widget that will be animated, separate effect classes for the most popular effects, sequential and parallel combinations of effects, deferred binding for browser-specific functionality, Listeners and Adapters and much more. Implementing a fade effect took me about 10 lines of Java code. And we all know Java is not the most succinct girl in town, right? Furthermore, while the Scriptaculous solution worked on IE, Firefox and Opera, it would barf on Safari (version 2 if you must know). gwt-fx worked on all of them without any special-casing in my code.\nAlso, when things don't work as expected, the author, Adam Tacy, is very cooperative and helpful. He has endured a flood of patches from me to solve some problems that I encountered, and when not satisfied with them, he implemented even better solutions after careful consideration and thoughtful reasoning. Just make sure to get the latest version (1.0.0) that has every bug I encountered so far, fixed.\nAdding a supported effects library in the main GWT distribution has been discussed a few times on the contributors list, but apparently it is not a high priority task at the moment. For a good reason I might add, since the release of GWT 1.5 is just around the corner, with support for Java 5 and a whole slew of compiler optimizations. However, with the recent introduction of the GWT incubator project it might be appropriate to start trying out some design ideas on such a library and see how it goes. If you care for such an outcome, don't hesitate to let the GWT developers know about it, by joining the discussion in the recent thread on the subject.", "id": "<urn:uuid:17b8854c-7af8-4cf0-982c-a4e50dbf28c7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.astithas.com/2007_11_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.963620126247406, "token_count": 1474, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Goodbye dearest Joyce\nThis past week the knitting world lost one of it’s treasures. Joyce Williams contemporary of Meg Swansen, author of Latvian Dreams and friend, passed away around noon on August 4th.\nIf you never had the pleasure of seeing Joyce’s work, or listening to her talk then I am sorry. I’ll never forget when I met her. I was vending at Madrona Fiber Arts and went to the bar (where everyone hangs out) to get a bottle of water. There were these two women sitting on one of the sofas chatting it up in some of the most beautiful knits I had ever seen. I couldn’t resist saying hello and complimenting them on their sweaters, the next thing I knew my cell was ringing and Debbi was wondering where the hell I had gotten off to. As I excused myself, explaining about the booth and all, we realized we have never exchanged names, just had launched right into knit-communion. So I introduced myself and was making plans to meet with them again when the smaller, fiery eyed one reached out her hand,seized mine and said I am Joyce Williams. Well… you could have knocked me over with a strand the finest lace yarn you can find. Here, for almost an hour I had been sitting and casually chatting with one of the most brilliant knit minds on the planet. I do believe my jaw dropped to my chest. I should’ve known. It was then I recognized the sweater she was wearing and well worked really hard at not kicking myself all over that bar. She was beyond gracious of course. What got me thoroughly in that moment was the twinkle in her eye when she caught my eye and whispered, it is my favourite piece in the book. I fell hard and fast for Joyce right then and there.\nMy life was enriched before meeting Joyce Williams in person because I had met her through her phenomenal designs. Meeting Joyce and getting to know and spend the little bit of time with her I have is a blessing I’ll cherish forever.\nI love you Joyce, you will be missed!", "id": "<urn:uuid:e15a4c02-c0a2-4f3d-b0dc-65b8a8b47995>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.bluemoonfiberarts.com/2011/08/09/goodbye_dearest_joyce/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9795690178871155, "token_count": 439, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "House Passes Continuing Resolution, Senate Expected to Vote on Omnibus\nOn Wednesday night, the House passed a year-long continuing resolution (CR) by a vote of 212-206 that would fund all government programs at last year’s levels until the end of the fiscal year (September 30, 2011). All Republican members voted “no,” along with 37 Democrats. The plan had been for the Senate to present an omnibus appropriations bill as a substitute for the House continuing resolution. If the Senate were to get the 60 votes necessary for cloture, the bill will be sent back to the House for consideration. The omnibus bill would contain about $19 billion more in funding than the House CR and would contain congressional earmarks. However, it appears the Senate will not vote on this until next week.\nHouse Select Committee Leadership\nThe House Republicans and Democrats on Tuesday announced new chairmen and ranking members for the slate of House committees for the 112th Congress. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee will be Hal Rogers (R-KY), while Norm Dicks (D-WA) will serve as ranking member.

The bill also gives the federal government the authority to apply nutritional standards to all food sold during the school day, including in vending machines, a la carte lines and other venues. There has been some concern that the new standards could impact CTE programs that sell student prepared food to raise money for their programs, but the bill does allow for an exemption for school-sponsored fundraisers that are approved by the school and are infrequent within the school.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5b7a6d02-2de6-4bcd-9ce1-1a50f977a748>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.careertech.org/?p=2804", "date": "2013-05-18T06:56:10Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.966012179851532, "token_count": 422, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Gov. Rick Perry defended the state’s controversial Voter ID law Friday during on a Fox news interview when he complained about interference from the federal government.\nThe Justice Department on Monday rejected the state’s Voter ID law because state officials failed to demonstrate the election changes would not make it harder for minorities to vote. Because of historic discrimination against minority voters, federal law requires Texas to prove its case before making any election changes.\nTexas is suing to overturn the 1965 law.\n“Here we are in 2012 and the idea that somehow or another a southern state, Texas in particular, a state that is a majority minority in our public schools now, is somehow or another being discriminatory toward minorities, I think, is a vestige of fear tactics that have been used through the years, and frankly, don’t hold water anymore,” Perry said in the interview.\n“This is not a Democratic or Republican issue,” the governor added. “Any person who does not want to see fraud believes in having good, open and honest elections – transparent. And one of the best ways to do that is having photo identification so you prove you are who you say you are, and you keep those elections fraud free.”\nThe vote to pass the bill into law, however, reflected a strong partisan perspective.\nAll 19 Texas Senate Republicans voted for it last year while all 12 Democrats opposed the bill. In the House, the key vote saw 100 Republicans and 1 Democrat supporting the bill. All 48 dissenting votes came from Democrats.\nSen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, acknowledges that voter fraud exists.\n“No one disputes that. However, what every investigation has proven is that the kind of fraud voter ID laws would address — voter impersonation — doesn’t really exist. In fact, there are more UFO and Bigfoot sightings than documented cases of voter impersonation,” Ellis said.\n“Literally millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent in Texas, South Carolina and across the country chasing the white whale that is voter impersonation,” Ellis said. “Several years ago, Texas supporters announced there was an ‘epidemic’ of this kind of voter fraud, launched an investigation and found nothing of the sort. They found 26 cases to prosecute and two-thirds of those were simple technical violations, not fraud and not one of the 26 would have been affected by a voter ID requirement. It is just a coincidence, I’m sure, that all 26 cases were brought against African American or Hispanic voters.”\nPerry told his Fox news audience Texas has “multiple cases of voter fraud in various places across the state,” according to legislative testimony.\nBut the evidence of voter impersonation, which the Voter ID law addresses, is sketchy.\nIn the 2010 general election, the Texas attorney general’s office received 7 allegations of election law violations, according to statistics the office provided to state Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas. Four of those seven cases involved mail-in ballots, which the Voter ID law does not address.\nOne of the 2010 general election alleged violations involved “unlawfully rejecting a voter, another involved “campaign finance violations” and the other dealt with “obtaining voter registration applications prior to being deputized, failing to timely deliver voter registration applications, false statement on voter registration and tampering with a governmental record”.\nNearly 5 million ballots were cast in the 2010 general election.\nThe 2008 election law violation allegations in the document provided to Anchia: “electioneering within 100 ft mark at a polling place,” “citizen not allowed to vote by an election worker,” “vote soliciting bribery on the internet (eBay),” “Unlawfully released police reports and narratives on one of the candidates running for sheriff (in Wichita County),” “providing false information on a voter registration application,” “ineligible to hold the office of county clerk (Terry County),” “Unlawful assistance, unlawfully influencing a voter and illegal voting,” “Unlawfully prevented from voting,” “Solicitation of campaign funds while on duty, selling of campaign fundraiser tickets while on duty and misuse of county employees while on county time,” “illegal voting,” “death row inmates registering to vote,” “non-citizen voted in election,” “election misconduct,” and “unlawful candidacy (Tarrant County).”\nMore than 8million Texans voted in the 2008 general election.\n“The only thing that I can put out is that there is obviously those who would like to fraudulently impact elections and, therefore, they are against having a photo ID. Otherwise, it makes all the sense in the world. And we have put in place ways for people to get those IDs,” Perry said in the interview.\nThe state will provide DPS voter ID cards for at least 600,000 registered voters who don’t have a Texas driver’s license.\nBut getting those cards could be difficult for those who live in 73 Texas counties without any DPS driver’s license office – or in inner city communities that also lack access to a driver’s license office.\n“The sad truth is that there is now a concerted all-out assault on the right to vote in this country, and minority and elderly voters are the ones being mugged,” Ellis said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:76e60c94-668f-4798-b1e6-aa0b1bb8de52>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2012/03/voter-id-good-elections-or-a-mugging/?gta=commentform", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9555128216743469, "token_count": 1151, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Johnson made the request during Monday night's council meeting. He also invoked a little-used rule that allows council members to question the mayor's Cabinet when he asked Safety Director Martin Flask about the investigation of Patrolman Anthony Sauto.\nThe chairman of council's Safety Committee said no review was planned.\nSauto arrested Jason Ruiz and Alexander Parilla outside Velvet Dog on West Sixth Street on Aug. 21 after a confrontation as the club was closing. A videotape showed Ruiz and Parilla yelling at Sauto and jabbing fingers toward his face. The tape also shows Ruiz grabbing Sauto's arm. Ruiz later said that Sauto punched him several times in the face.\nRuiz was charged with three misdemeanors. Parilla was not charged with a crime.\nResponding to Johnson's questions, Flask said the investigation by Police Chief Michael McGrath's office found that use of force was justified. Flask said investigators did not interview Ruiz or Parilla. He added that the two men have not filed a complaint against police.\nThe incident became public after the men complained to the Cleveland chapter of the NAACP.\nFlask also said that based on the videotape, race did not play a role in the incident. Sauto is white.\nRuiz and Parilla were wrong for yelling at Sauto and pointing fingers, but that did not justify Sauto punching Ruiz, Johnson said.\n\"These are public servants trained to deal with disputes,\" Johnson said. \"If they can't resolve disputes beyond hitting someone in the face, it's unacceptable.\"\nJohnson said there has long been a culture of insensitivity toward minorities in the Warehouse District, which is a mix of bars, nightclubs and high-end restaurants.\n\"People don't want to deal with that,\" Johnson said.\nCouncilman Kevin Conwell, chairman of council's Safety Committee, said after Monday's meeting that he did not plan to hold hearings about the police probe.\n\"I trust the mayor,\" Conwell said. \"I'm not going to meddle.\"\nJohnson criticized Jackson for his lack of leadership after the incident became public.\nJackson could not be reached for comment after Monday night's meeting.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9b0641bc-c5f1-48c8-aca3-757c5ec04cee>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/09/cleveland_councilman_jeff_john.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:14:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.982972264289856, "token_count": 450, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "This week’s featured Cogswell Insider is Jessica Bower!\nQ: What is your major/program and student status (frosh, soph, jun, sen)?\nA: My major is DAA (Digital Art and Animation) and I’m specializing in 3D Modeling. I am a junior.\nQ: What student activities are you involved in?\nA: I am involved with Game Development Club, Women of Cogswell Club, and All-Student Board. In those clubs I am currently VP of Game Club, VP of Women’s Club, and I’m an Executive Board Member on ASB.\nQ: Can you tell me a little bit more about the Women of Cogswell Club? I’ve seen some of the Bake Sales as fundraising, those definitely hearken to the domesticity of the female stereotype, is this all in jest? Are there any men involved in the club, by chance?\nA: We are a group designed to get the women (and men) of our school together to talk about issues and host events. The posters we have up are definitely in good fun. We’re just poking fun at the typical female stereotype and it also draws attention to the club. And yes, there are quite a few men involved in the club. It’s about 50/50 when it comes to the male/female ratio.\nQ: What was your impression of Cogswell (classes/student body) when you started? Has it changed?\nA: When I first started Cogswell, I was dazzled and I still am. This school has so much to offer in the field I want to pursue, which is making video games, and my old college did not have these courses. I figured the campus, class and student wise, would be similar to my old college, but now that I’ve been here for a year, that view has definitely changed. You never know what to expect here. The people here are a unique bunch of folks.\nQ: As a student myself, I completely get the unique quality of the student body. What are some of the crazy quirks you’ve seen? Any crazy stories?\nA: It’s difficult to just point out any specific crazy quirk, and there are a lot in my opinion. However, story-wise there are plenty, but one does come to mind. It was finals week and Samantha and I needed to work on finals at school. She got the idea to build a couch fort in ASB office. We brought blankets and pillows, pushed the couch and chair in ASB together, built the fort, and slept in it till the next day.\nQ: What do you look forward to most in the school year? Projects? Events?\nA: I look forward to learning new things and building onto my current knowledge. Going to student events is the highlight of the semester when midterm and final projects start to rear their heads and most of your time is dedicated to working on them.\nQ: What have been the most memorable events for you?\nA: The most rememberable events for me would be the first student housing event I ever went to when we all went to a beach in Santa Cruz and I got buried vertically and lost my glasses in the ocean (they were found). The second most memorable would be the Global Game Jam that happened at our school in Spring 2010.\nQ: Have you met anyone interesting/networked with people you see yourself working with in the future?\nA: I have in fact! When the Global Game Jam was here [at Cogswell] in spring of 2010, I got the pleasure of working with four people in the industry. I’m horrible with names, but one I clearly remember was Rob Jagnow, Founder of Lazy 8 Studios and the sole programmer for their indie game “Cogs”. Everyone on my team was so amazing. I knew nothing about game making, but they helped teach me and we created a fun game to play! I feel that I can definitely see myself working with them when I improve my skills and the chance arises.\nQ: If so, how have your career plans changed since studying? Are they still on track with what you wanted when you started?\nA: I originally wanted to be a concept artist, but I learned that the industry has many people wanting to get into that particular profession and my drawing skills, in my opinion, are not up to par with industry standards. So, I changed to 3D modeling, because as long as I’m creating something I am happy.\nThanks to Jessica for taking part in the Cogswell student series!

{"text": "By Anne M. Amato\nSHELTON — The condition of one of the three men injured in a house explosion earlier this week has been upgraded, according to John Cappiello, Bridgeport Hospital spokesman.\nHe said that Randy Fera, 59, of Stratford, who was in critical condition at the hospital following the Monday afternoon explosion is now in fair condition.\nFera and Gary Henry, 24, of Waterbury, both employees of Pioneer Gas and Appliance Co. were in the basement of a house at 67 Wopowog Trail on a routine job when the blast occurred.\nHenry, and the third victim, Luke Lauretti, 48, brother of Mayor Mark A. Lauretti, remain in critical condition, Cappiello said.\nA propane gas leak, caused by an unsecured gas line to a home, resulted in the explosion, according to Fire Marshal Jim Tortora.\nWilliam Papale, Pioneer owner, said his employees were at the house to change over the homeowner’s service from another company to Pioneer, which is a routine job. He said there was already an existing gas system in the home and all they needed to do was put in a new propane tank.\nHe said safety is his company’s “No. 1 concern” and that this is the first time in the 70 years the company has been in business that “something like this has happened.”\nBefore the explosion occurred, two other occupants of the house, Debra Duguid, 53, and her daughter, were told to go outside when workers smelled gas. Duguid and her daughter were not injured in the 2 p.m. blast, but were in shock because of what happened.\nNeighbor Bart Bakota, 20, heard the explosion and said he saw flames shooting from the house, which is across the street from his, and then saw three men coming out of the building.\n“They were all badly burned,” said Bakota. “They had burns all over their face, head, legs, hands and back.” Parts of their clothes were burned off and their hair singed, he said.\nPolice and fire officials said the main beam of the house was shattered and the basement walls were blown out.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9827572c-37d7-41d9-b38f-bba8908f563d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.ctnews.com/connecticutpostings/2012/09/12/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:13:08Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9891665577888489, "token_count": 472, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Addy now helps me with the dishes. She loads the silverware into the dishwasher and puts them in the drawer when they're clean. She doesn't get them in the right places usually, but at least she's willingly helping!\nAddy has gained an appreciation or attraction for baby dolls of late. She always wants to have one with her and won't go to sleep without at least one, sometimes three. We try to limit her to 2 babies because she just doesn't have that many arms. If she has too many at night she hits herself or does something where she wakes up.\nSometimes we put Addy on our bed to sleep when she's extra grumpy. I helped her fall asleep and then later came back to find her like this. Yes, she is asleep, fast asleep. This is the only time I've found her sleeping like this.\nThis is a picture of the supermarket at the Children's Museum. She likes being the cashier, but also likes to \"eat\" the food before she pays for it. That's a bad habit I caused. Sometimes when she's grumpy in the store, I open the cheese sticks or crackers before we pay for them. :)\nAddy loves playing on the computer. From her daddy working all day on one to her mommy surfing the internet a lot she is exposed to the computer frequently. Whenever Jordan comes out of his office to talk to me or get something to eat, Addy races past him, runs over to his chair, climbs up, and starts \"programming\" on the computer. One time when Jordan wasn't even logged in she opened the bios of the computer. Jordan said that's the part that tells the computer the basic functions like how to turn on and stuff. Thankfully she didn't confirm any of the changes she made. We thought the computer would be safe because there was no way she could randomly type in Jordan's password. Now we're not so sure.\nHere is a video of Addy being helpful.

{"text": "As I begin this post, I am nine days, six hours and 31 minutes away from leaving a very comfortable, generously-paid job where my colleagues and leadership respect me and treat me well. In just over a week’s time, my girlfriend (and adventuring partner), Aubrey, and I will be driving off into the night, embarking on an incredible roadtrip to seek out a new home somewhere beyond the Rocky Mountains.\nThere are no words to convey my excitement.\nFor as long as I’ve existed, there has always been an obligation to someone else’s rules lurking just beyond the horizon. Even on vacations, where time is theoretically mine, there was the lingering, ever-present knowledge that before I knew it, I would go back to a world of obliging someone else’s whims. For the first time, I’ll escape those bonds. It’s a feeling of freedom I’ve never known.\nIt must be stressed that while Full Sail has been a great place to work and I’m grateful for the experience, I had a job there and I have a handful of problems with working any “job,” no matter who supplies it. When I say job in this context, I mean any paid activity wherein you provide 40+ weekly hours in exchange for a regular paycheck, benefits and perhaps a reasonable approximation of social interaction. I’m a difficult, demanding, even impossible person, so these problems loom larger for me than perhaps they do you.\nWhen you arrive at your job and get down to the business of working, you are addressing problems that are not yours. These are the problems of whatever organization has hired you for your job. Depending on your level of career advancement and achievement, the problems you solve may range from the tedious (data entry) to the complicated (project or team management). No matter the complexity of your daily tasks, though, you can be assured that none of the problems they address are actually your own. While it is true that, through initiative, hard work and persistence, your handling of the organization’s problems can enrich your knowledge, experience and career prospects, this doesn’t change the fact that you’re doing someone else’s work.\nUnless you’re working at some sort of hippy, ultra-progressive company, you give 96% of your weeks to your job. That is a shitload of time. When I write it out like that, the egregious criminality of giving away that much of your life to someone who isn’t you seems so obvious, I can’t even come up with anything else to say.\nI’ve spent a lifetime resenting any condition where someone else had authority to direct the discharge of my energies. The trade you make while collecting a paycheck is that in exchange for the money, someone gets to tell you what to do with 96% of your weeks. Even with the best boss, this deal is crap: Who wants to spend this much of their lives following orders?\nIn the typical job arrangement, I would show up each day and give a significant amount of time, energy, imagination and passion to the tasks of the organization. If I worked exceptionally hard while not being a douche and doing my best to help others be successful, I could earn promotions and more money. I would not become wealthy. Meanwhile, assuming successful management of the company, those who own the organization would increase their wealth. For many people, maintaining the wealth of others in exchange for a job’s security is a fine trade. That doesn’t work for me. If there’s anyone who should be wealthy off the sweat of my brow, I’m the first person on that list.\nThis is also including the assumption that whomever it is who owns the company is making the right decisions, which is absolutely not a given. There’s an illusion of security in a paycheck that comes crashing down as soon as layoffs or bankruptcy are announced (hello, domestic auto manufacturers). I’d rather have control of my fate than leave it in the hands of someone else.\nAlignment of Interests\nIf your company did not need you, you would not exist there. This is a simple, business-driven reality and under no circumstances would I ever begrudge any organization this simple fact. Business is not and should not be charity. Still, think about it. The interest of the business is always and will always be the business. Never you, as an individual. This is an important fact to remember as you commit 96% of your weeks to the job that has hired you. You are the only person you can trust to have your own best interests as a top priority. Rest assured, if the business felt as though it could get more of your time while paying you less, it would surely take that arrangement. It’s just business.\nYou show up early, stay late. You take on extra projects and complete them in your spare time. You’re good to your coworkers and can always be relied upon in a pinch. Congratulations, you’re on your way to promotions and potential raises.\nThe trouble is, if you gave this level of effort for clients instead of your boss, you’d make a whole lot more money.\nIf you’re following the thread of my argument, you might be thinking “hey, wow, having a job is slavery and my company is screwing me over!”\nTwo things to note: Having a job gives you incredible opportunities to learn, grow and network while giving you the stability to develop yourself over the long term.\nSecondly, unless you signed some sort of contract, you can leave any time you like. If you’re prepared.\nSo prepare yourself. Maybe I’m young and idealistic, but I firmly believe that the pursuit of things I genuinely love will bring me infinitely more reward than being paid to worry about someone else’s problems. I believe that dedicating the bulk of my time to my own growth, wealth and self-selected challenges, rather than to the development of someone else’s business, is the only conscionable use of my time. I believe that investing myself in an organization whose best interest is something that isn’t me would be to ignore one simple fact: I’m going to die one day. I need to make the most of my life and working for someone else isn’t going to cut it.\nYou may be following this, finding none of my assessments about having a job objectionable and thinking to yourself that I am, in fact, absurdly difficult and demanding. If that is so I salute you: your expectations for your life are much more easily satisfied.\nI’m stuck wanting something else for myself. Thankfully, I’ve got some role models to help me handle this drive for a self-directed life.\nI heard Adam Savage give a talk where he mentioned that his line of work is mostly freelance. This perked up my ears. If you’ve spent any amount of time watching MythBusters, you know that Adam has a singular passion for the creative work that he does. He currently has the best job in the world because he desperately, obsessively craves the joy of making things. He’s incredibly good at it. I’m certain he never could have attained his world-class skills without first loving the work to begin with.\nNick Popovich, Super Repo Man\nIf you need a defaulted plane retrieved from a deadbeat, you call this guy. Nick had some flight skills and did his first repo on a whim. Now he owns a $20 million business grabbing planes from all corners of the globe. He’s good at it and he enjoys the work. Imagine the waste of his talents if he had stuck to being a traditional pilot and never realized his unique ability to resolve impossible, dangerous situations.\nJohn is obsessive about details in design, typography, user experience and software development. He’s also obsessive about Apple. It shocks me that time and again, John is able to render completely accurate predictions about Apple’s direction and upcoming products. It’s a level of insight no one else on the web can match. It also puts professional investment analysts to shame. Is it incredible that six-figure salaried analysts can’t match the insight and prescience of a guy working from his home on a blog he maintains by himself? A little bit, but it should not be surprising at all. Only a love and passion for his subject matter could have made John the authority on all things Apple on the web.\nI don’t know that she feels great about me saying so here, but it’s important to the legend: my mom didn’t finish high school or go to college. She does have a GED. She’s a minority for whom english is a second language. In pretty much all the ways a single mom can have the chips stacked against her, she had.\nMy mom loves animals – always has. It’s truly an obsession with her. In my childhood, I can recall the ownership of three ostriches, a donkey, six geese, dozens of chickens, an African Grey Parrot, dozens of dogs, some cats and multiple generations of coral reef tanks with tropical fish that made the house a viable field trip destination.\nWhen I was very young, my mom took a certificate program at the New York School of Dog Grooming. To pay homage to James Herriot, no capped and gowned don ever looked back to his years among the spires of Oxford with more nostalgia than did my mother to her two months at NYSDG.\nIf I am difficult and demanding, then my mom truly is impossible. Nonetheless, she endured years of working for shitty bosses at shittier dog grooming shops. I don’t know how she did it, but one day, she had enough. I’m not sure where she got the funds, but she put together enough money to lease and renovate a commercial space, adding all of the kennels, baths, and other equipment necessary to provide absurdly clean, professional dog grooming services. For pretty much the rest of my childhood (and to this day), she was self-employed, her own boss. Despite the statistics for small business failure, my mom was and continues to be wildly successful at her trade without any training in business, marketing or finance. She doesn’t need it: she’s just incredibly good at what she does, wanted to provide the best possible service and has always loved her work. Not many other people can offer this. This was enough to ensure I never went hungry as a kid.\nThe message is clear: if you love the work you do, you can become so good at it that whatever rewards you seek become attainable.\nI’ll say it again: I’m going to die one day. I don’t know if it’s next year or many decades from now or somewhere in between. What I do know is that expending my energies within the narrow, limiting, self-denying confines required by the traditional job is a complete waste of whatever existence I have at my disposal.\nAubrey has brought many incredible gifts of insight to my life, but chief of among them is this: you shouldn’t spend any significant amount of time doing something you don’t want to do. I owe so much of my evolution to that crucial realization.\nI’m excited to be in business for myself. The nagging feeling that plagued me for so long, the feeling that I was somehow missing the point of life and wasting my time, is completely gone.\nI’ve discovered a list of things that I absolutely love to do. I’m already good at some of them while others will require years of time to develop. That’s no problem – the love makes it easier to get through the rough spots. I’ve spent years aggressively growing myself to reach this point. I had no idea where I was heading.\nNow I know. I can’t wait to be able to focus on what’s truly important, free from the distraction of minding someone else’s business.\nLeave a comment", "id": "<urn:uuid:79d3cac2-f5f2-4124-9283-940bf8c74c68>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.danilocampos.com/2009/06/21/love-what-you-do-do-it-for-you/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:17:41Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9679981470108032, "token_count": 2574, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}
{"text": "Hi Guys! Well, high winds, power outages, the helicopters circling my house all morning – it’s all going crazy in Atlanta this week! I’m happy to be back online and able to tell you a few bits of news around the blogs this week as I catch up.Â Media breaks can be good I suppose, but yours truly usually needs to be forced by a natural disaster or something.\nFirst, I stumbled onto The Complete Organizing Solutions Blog via Tanna, who emailed me to ask if she could use a picture of my pursery. Hey, to anyone who would like to post any of my mediocre-at-best photography from flickr, you can always be my guest! Thanks Tanna. This is a great blog for organization inspiration. Check it out!\nNext, I was thrilled to see another favorite blogger, Victoria, a.k.a sfgirlbybay, featured in the March issue of Sunset magazine. It’s funny, Victoria switches up her apartment styling so often that I almost didn’t recognize it from the first picture. It seemed oddly familiar but it wasn’t until I saw her tulip chairs that I knew where I knew that place from! The most heroic thing about Victoria’s styling,Â is that she is CONSTANTLY switching up and rotating her art collection. This is no easy feat. It usually takes me about five years to get one arrangement just right. Victoria has mad skillz when it comes to arranging art. Perhaps she needs to go into business on the side helping the rest of us compositionally challenged types! Congratulations Victoria!\nNext, I caught up on the old DVR. Of course Lost, The Wire, and In Treatment came first. I think the most entertaining thing I saw from last week was Michael Kors LOSING IT on Project Runway during the WWE Divas Challenge. It was like getting the giggles in church, he just could not get it under control. To check it out, be sure to catch the Reunion episode before watching the Bryant Park episode this week.\nFinally, as a blogger, I just had to check out Quarterlife. Like all other shows by this duo (Herskovitz and Zwick), they take a typical formula, throw in a tortured misunderstood artist, stripped a few characters of makeup and maybe stick them in glasses and create what they think is a really deep show. Like thirtysomething and Once and Again before it, Quarterlife seems like it’s about four times longer than it is. I mean with TiVo, it’s about 40 minutes, but it feels like 4 hours because it’s so boring.\n1) from Complete Organizing Solutions\n2) by Thomas J.

{"text": "Without so much as a parting word, they walked out on us. No emotional farewells. No longing, final glances. They didn’t even bother to leave a note sealed with a kiss, on the crumpled pillow. We thought we had a good, solid thing going here. We’d been in bed with them for quite a while. And we’ve been loyal to the bitter end. Call us romantic, but if it was to ever happen, we imagined it playing out kind of like this…\nWe’ll always have Paris? Not quite. We were quickly faced with the cold, painful truth. They’d been seduced by a rich, trendy, shiny boy toy who happens to use a first-person, singular pronoun for a name.* And, to add insult to injury, they’d already moved in to i’s swanky, new pad.\nBut, “Hey, this is business!”, you might be thinking about the Agency 5’s decision to sever their ties with us, and to shut us out of all their titles, in order to make them available on Apple’s iPad. That’s right, it is business! And the way we conduct our business, here at Diesel, is to lovingly nurture our partnerships – whether they’re with distributors, publishers or customers. And, at the risk of being naïve, we expect the same in return – thank you very much.\nLook, we’re human. Sometimes, we forget to do the dishes or take out the trash. But the point is that we really wish more companies out there behaved with some level of integrity where it counts – in their business relationships. But, noooo. Too many of them are still not realizing that this is a brave new plugged-in, “social” world in which the old ways of doing cut-throat deals are going out the window with yesterday’s business ethics models (see our last post for more on this topic). Yes, the moral codices for business and personal interaction are becoming inexorably intertwined. Haven’t you heard? Where the hell have you been, dude? The traditional one-way marketing conversation has become a, truthful two-way dialogue. And not soon enough.\nWhat was once accepted as normal, “institutionalized” predatory behavior in the name of just making a buck, is out…period! Double period!! Hello? If you don’t get that Mr. Macmillan, Mr. S. A. Schuster, Monsieur Hachette, et al, you’re in for a rude awakening, eventually. Information is being shared by your customers, prospects and competitors every day through all the new social media channels. Relationships are being forged, brands are being made and strengthened, and potential new customers are being engaged. With an exponential number of eyeballs accessible to you, are you really willing to keep going down that path? You’ve already taken a rather salient and bold move by discarding us – the retailers and their customer base – like a worn out book jacket cover. Think long and hard. What will your next one be? We sincerely hope it’s a move that speaks to the angels of our (and your) better nature.\nAnd if it’s not, at least have the decency to whisper sweet nothings in our ears while you’re f*@$#^%g us. Oh, and some chocolates would be nice, too.\n*(Please Note: Genders roles are interchangeable, here.

{"text": "Over the past year or so, Evernote has begun to really focus on the design and experience of our apps. We’ve been inspired by a wide range of companies and products that do this right, from Apple to Uchida Yoko to Moleskine. In fact, in Moleskine, we saw more than inspiration, we saw an opportunity to do something amazing together that fully embodied our Experience First thinking.\nMoleskine is the maker of beautifully designed notebooks and accessories that are the go-to choice for creative individuals of all types. While these notebooks are beloved for their quality and style, they suffer from an issue common to all physical notebooks…they’re physical.\nThat’s where Evernote comes in. We’ve partnered with Moleskine to develop a new, limited edition Evernote Smart Notebook that’s designed specifically for the new Evernote iOS application.\nTogether, we created a gorgeous notebook that includes a number of special features that allow you to take your ideas off the written page and place them right into Evernote, where they’ll be searchable, organized and available forever.\nNew Features. Magical Pages. Smart Stickers.\nOur goal was to create a notebook that met Moleskine’s aesthetic standards, while adding an entirely new level of functionality. Here’s what we did.\nThe Evernote Smart Notebook comes in two page styles: ruled and squared. For each, we designed a special dotted paper pattern on the pages that was optimized for new features in Evernote…\nEvernote for iPhone and iPad got an update today (version 4.4) that includes the new Page Camera functionality, which is designed for photos of physical pages and documents.\nTo use the Page Camera, launch the camera inside of Evernote, then tap on the new Page Camera icon at the top of the screen. Hold your camera above the page and center the image inside the rectangle. Snap a photo, then move on to the next page. Using your flash ensures that you’ll get the highest quality image. Tap on the page numbers to review the images you’ve taken. Tap the checkmark when you’re done.\nPage Camera automatically improves the contrast of the page and removes any shadows. For the Evernote Smart Notebook by Moleskine, it finds the dot pattern and even corrects the skew of the photo. This means that the images that end up in your account are perfect for Evernote’s handwriting recognition, so that you’ll be able to find you thoughts anytime. But, there’s more…\nAs if that wasn’t cool enough, in the back pocket of each Moleskine notebook you’ll find a set of multi-color Smart Stickers. When you apply a sticker to a page and take a photo, Evernote recognizes the sticker and instantly associates a tag with the note or places it into a notebook that you specify in your Settings. The Smart Stickers come with some pre-defined tags, but you can customize them to be whatever you want.\nIn addition to the Smart Stickers, we also included some handy Skitch arrows. Use those to draw attention to important things on the page.\nCheck out our Getting Started with Evernote Smart Notebook for some guidance on getting started.\nAs if all of that wasn’t great enough, each notebook also comes with 3-months of Evernote Premium.\nThese beautiful and powerful notebooks will be available in two sizes, pocket ($24.95) and large ($29.95), beginning on October 1. If you would like to be among the first to get your hands on one, you can pre-order them today from the Evernote Store.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5241c567-a758-468d-9b1a-dd2865a9dcab>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2012/08/24/the-new-evernote-smart-notebook-by-moleskine/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:55:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9106812477111816, "token_count": 796, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Results tagged “Tops” from Fabric.com Blog\nLiberty of London- Just say it out loud. It just sounds like great fabric. Saying that words bring pictures of English countryside, blooming flowers, tea heavy in the air and double-decker buses. Saying the name \"Liberty of London\" makes me want to sew. And sew I have. I was given 2 yards of Liberty of London Lawn Pepper Green (one of our MANY gorgeous prints from Liberty of London) as soon as it arrived in our shop and told to make something great but try to keep the project small and fun. Well, that was no problem given that it is spring, almost summer. I decided on 2 projects to show the variety of Liberty. These prints are perfect for wee people as well as adults and it is perfect for warm weather.\nMy first project was the trickiest because I wanted a sleeveless shirt but nothing with too much detail to compete with the print of the fabric. I sorted through the Fabric.com pattern catalog but didn't find anything I loved! Well, I became sidetracked with a personal project of making new PJs for myself and found the pattern that was perfect for the Liberty of London. It is HotPatterns Cupid Cami (And it's a free pattern download!). Originally designed as a PJ top, I didn't see why with a fabric substitution it would not make the most wonderful summer top. I love being right. With some Hanky Weight Linen as my bias tape, this cami took approx 1 yard of Liberty of London (you are safe with just ordering 1 yd) and about 2-3 hours to complete (having had to make the bias tape). I did have to add darts of 4 in. long by 1 in. wide at the bust but that was my only modification. This top is easy to make and can be easily modified for a longer length; it hit right at my hips. The ties at the top are so much fun and make me feel like a kid again. I do recommend that when you sew the front to the back that you start at the bottom when matching up the sides. If you start at the top, it will not match up once you get to the bottom. Once you sew the seam, it will all work out.\nMy second project also took approx 1 yd and came from Heather Ross Weekend Sewing. I have made the Flower Girl before and know it runs a little small so I made the size 4 for my 2 yr old; I want her to have it for several summers. This print really brought out something in this pattern that the other dress did not have. The Liberty of London print sort of 'fits' this pattern like no other fabric. The Flower Girl dress also went to together super quick, 2 hours or so. I cut my skirt length to 20 in. to make it longer like in the book photograph. The other modifications were to topstitch the gathers in place once I had pressed the bodice seam towards the skirt and I made the straps a bit wider at 1.5 in. I think even a bit wider than that would still look great. You could even get away with some flat piping where the bodice and skirt meet. You could not ask for a better combination of dress and print for little girls.\nThe flow and drape of the Liberty of London Lawn is light and delicate with an airiness that will be most welcome come the balmy days of summer. The print reminds me of my childhood, of picnics and climbing trees. You can't beat the soft hand or bright colors; this is a fabric that needs to be in your closet.\nToday I am reviewing some of my favorite patterns, perfect for the upcoming spring. These patterns are versatile and fun. They work with a multitude of fabrics from Quilting cotton, linen, voile and silk. There is also a bounty of these patterns in different finishes throughout blogland should you need inspiration. I, myself, cannot wait to try modifications to really fill out my spring wardrobe.\nThe first pattern is Favorite Things Prairie Girl Pattern. I made the top version and it was really easy as far as tops go. The fit is semi fitted with some ease through the bust and the hips. I nixed the modesty panel in favor of mixing my different color tank tops underneath. I also went with the capped sleeves instead of the fluttery sleeves. I love the ties and the v-neck, which really needs something underneath but is complimentary to any bust. One of my favorite things about this great neck line is that it begs for a necklace and I love a good necklace. Next time I am planning to cut the skirt a few sizes bigger and add in gathers. I also want to make the ties twice as long and in a contrasting color so I can wrap them around and add definition to the waist. I am also considered doing the flutter sleeve but layering 2, one in the main print and the second (cut 1 size bigger) in the same contrasting fabric as the ties.\nNext is the Apron Overlay by Amy Butler, Barcelona Skirts. It was fun and really easy to make too. I love the weight of the two layers of cotton coupled with the gathers; it really adds structure. Next time, I will not sew up the bottom but sew both sides to the waist band, turn it out and topstitch the bottom. If my stitches are going to not be perfect, I would rather it be on the hem than the waist. When I make this overlay again I will not use so many prints but couple prints and solids together. I think so many prints, or rather the prints that I used, compete with each other. I would pick one solid and a print for each side and perhaps a smaller print with less business. I am also looking forward to trying different fabric with this, maybe a light-weight linen or silk coupled with a shorter length to wear with tunics & leggings. Another idea bouncing around is to leave the contrast stripe down the center but join the 2 panels so there is no split down the center. This will give more of an apron look but more of a skirt feel.\nor you can get the inside scoop on my projects, see their progress and get extra tips and tricks by following me@tdangermiller", "id": "<urn:uuid:dc893003-fc19-419c-ac6f-52fae7566f46>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.fabric.com/cgi-bin/mt4/mt-search.cgi?tag=Tops&blog_id=1&IncludeBlogs=1", "date": "2013-05-18T05:55:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9689976572990417, "token_count": 1299, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "I just came across this pro GMO article which I found offensive enough that I needed to immediately write a rebuttal:\nWould Rachel Carson Embrace ‘Frankenfoods’? – This Scientist Believes ‘Yes’\nHere’s my rebuttal:\nI find it very irksome when articles like this suggest that scientists are “ok” with transgenics while those on the other side are just fear mongering. Instead of spewing propaganda, let’s look at scientific facts.\nMany scientists have raised concern over resistance to Bt toxin. Given that Bt transgenic crops express this toxin over the entire plant, throughout the plant’s life, there is very real concern that constant, chronic exposure to Bt toxin will lead to resistant pests. This pest resistance has already been found to be happening. As pests become resistant to Bt toxin, pesticide applications will increase. As such, it is a concern that any currently observed reductions in pesticide use will be short lived. Following are a few peer reviewed studies:\n1. Agi, A., J. Mahaffey, J. Bradley, and J. van Dunn, ‘‘Efficacy of Seed Mixes of Transgenic Bt and Non Transgenic Cotton Against Bollworm,’’ Helicoverpa zea Boddie. Journal of Cotton Science 5 (2001), 74–80.\n2. Alyokhin, A. V. and D. N.

Tasbashnik, ‘‘Large- Scale Management of Insect Resistance to Transgenic Cotton in Arizona: Can Transgenic Insecticidal Crops be Sustained?,’’ Journal of Economic Entomology 94 (2001), 315–325.\n6. Chaufaux, J., M. Seguin, J. J. Swanson, D. Bourguet, and B. D. Seigfried, ‘‘Chronic Exposure of the European Corn Borer (Lepidoptera: Cambidae) to Cry1Ab Bacillus thuringiensis\nScientists have also raised concerns about the impact of Bt from transgenics on non-target species with the Monarch butterfly being a common topic. Remember, in the case of transgenic Bt crops, the toxin is being excreted all the time as opposed to discreet applications in conventional farming. Here are some peer reviewed studies:\n1. Hansen, L. C. and J. J. Obrycki, ‘‘Field Deposition of Bt Transgenic Corn Pollen: Lethal Effects on theMonarch Butterfly,’’ Oecologica 125 (2000), 241–248.\n2. Sears, M. K., R. L Hellmich, D. E. Stanley-Horn, K. S. Berhauser, J. M. Pleasants, H. R. Mattila, B. D. Siegfried, and G. P. Dively, ‘‘Impact of Bt Corn Pollen on Monarch Butterfly Populations: A Risk Assessment,’’ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98 (2001), 11937–11942.\n3. Zangerl, A. R., D. Mckenna, C. L. Wraight, M. Carroll, P. Ficarello, R. Warner, and M. R. Berenbaum, ‘‘Effects of Exposure to Event 176 Bacillus thuringiensis Corn Pollen on Monarch and Black Swallowtail Caterpillars under Field Conditions,’’ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98 (2001), 11908–11912.\nBecause Bt toxin in transgenic plants are excreted from every part of the plant, including the roots, scientists have raised concerns regarding potential negative impact on beneficial insects that as a part of the natural ecosystem help reduce pests and maintain healthy soil. Following are some peer reviewed studies:\n1. Crecchio, C. and G. Stotzky, ‘‘Insecticidal Activity and Biodegradation of the Toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. kurstaki Bound to Humic Acids from Soil,’’ Soil Biology and Biochemistry 30 (1998), 463– 470.\n2. Cui, J. and J. Xia, ‘‘Effects of Transgenic Bt Cotton on the Population Dynamics of Natural Enemies,’’ Acta Gossypii Sinica 11 (1999), 84–91.\n3 . Dutton, A., H. Klein, J. Romeis, and F. Bigler, ‘‘Uptake of Bt-Toxin by Herbivores Feeding on Transgenic Maize and Consequences for the Predator Chrysoperla carnea,’’ Ecological Entomology 27 (2002), 441– 447.\n4. Dinel, H., M. Schnitzer, M. Saharinen, F. Meloche, T. Pare, S. Dumontet, L. Lemee, and A. Ambles, ‘‘Extractable Soil Lipids and Microbial Activity as Affected by Bt and Non Bt Maize Grown on a Silty Clay Loam Soil,’’ Journal of Environmental Science and Health 38 (2003), 211–219.\n5. Donegan, K. K., R. J. Seidler, V. J. Fieland, D. L. Schaller, C. J. Palm, L. M. Ganio, D. M. Cardwell, and Y. Steinberger, ‘‘Decomposition of Genetically Engineered Tobacco Under Field Conditions: Persistence of the Proteinase Inhibitor I Product and Effects on Soil Microbial Respiration and Protozoa, Nematode and Microarthropod Populations,’’ Journal of Applied Ecology 34 (1997), 767–777.\nScientists have also raised concerns that herbicide resistant GM crops could lead to reductions in biodiversity which in the long run could impact productivity. Two peer reviewed studies are here:\n1. Andow, D. A., ‘‘UK Farm-Scale Evaluations of Transgenic Herbicide- Tolerant Crops,’’ Nature Biotechnology 21 (2003), 1453–1454.\n2. Brooks, D. R. (and 32 others), ‘‘Invertebrate Responses to the Management of Genetically Modified Herbicide-Tolerant and Conventional Spring Crops. I. Soil-Surface-Active Invertebrates,’’ Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (London) 358 (2003), 1847–1862.\nMany scientists have raised concerns about the potential for transgenes to jump from one plant to another or even across species. Many normal pathways for DNA movement exist namely sexual reproduction and dispersal (eg. pollen, fruit, gametes, embryos, offspring), non-sexual gene transfer such as between bacteria or between bacteria and higher organisms (horizontal transfer). In the case of horizontal transfer, the genetic material does not have to be in the living organism. It could be in decayed tissue, in feces, in the gut, etc. Given that transgenes are naturally unstable and are also armed with all the “tools” to jump into a genome, they are at significant risk of jumping out of their host genome and into other non-target genomes through the pathways described above. Here are a few peer reviewed studies on this subject:\n1. Doerfler, W. and R. Schubbert, ‘‘Uptake of Foreign DNA from the Environment: The Gastrointestinal Tract and the Placenta as Portals of Entry,’’ Wein Klin. Wochenschr 110(2) (1998), 40–44\n2. Duggan, P. S., P. A. Chambers, J. Heritage, and J. M. Forbes, ‘‘Survival of Free DNA Encoding Antibiotic Resistance from Transgenic Maize and the Transformation Activity of DNA in Ovine Saliva, Ovine Rumen Fluid and Silage Effluent,’’ FEMS Microbiology Letters 191 (2000), 71–77.\n3. Einspanier, R. L., A. Klotz, J. Kraft, K. Aulrich, R. Poser, F. Schwagele, G. Jahreis, and G. Flachowsky, ‘‘The fate of Forage Plant DNA in Farm Animals: A Collaborative Case-Study Investigating Cattle and Chicken Fed Recombinant Plant Material,’’ European Food Research and Technology 212 (2001), 129–134.\nThis study is the first recorded confirmation that transgenic DNA can in fact be transferred to gut bacteria in the human gut:\nNetherwood, T., S. Martin-Orue, A. G. O’Donnell, S. Gockling, J. Graham, J. C.Mathers, and H. J. Gilbert, ‘‘Assessing the Survival of Transgenic Plant DNA in the Human Gastrointestinal Tract,’’ Nature Biotechnology 22 (2004), 204–209.\nMovement of transgenic material into non-target species is a big deal. For example, antibiotic resistance is a common marker used in the transformation process. If antibiotic resistance started jumping into the environment, it would create a whole slew of human and environmental health issues. The fact that it has been shown that transgenic material can be taken up by gut bacteria in the human gut also opens up the potential for movement of transgenic DNA into the human genome which could have serious health implications.\nThere is serious concern from the scientific community that transgenes could also spread into wild relatives with risk being transfer of herbicide resistance to “weedy” relatives. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest this is already happening. Here are some peer reviewed studies:\n1. Halfhill, M. D., R. J. Millwood, P. L. Raymer, and C. N. Stewart, Jr. ‘‘Bt-Transgenic Oilseed Rape Hybridization with its Weedy Relative, Brassica rapa,’’ Environmental Biosafety Research 1 (2002), 19–28.\n2. Haygood, R., A. Ives, and D. A. Andow, ‘‘Consequences of Recurrent Gene Flow from Crops to Wild Relatives,’’ Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 270 (2003), 1879–1886.\n3. Lefol, E., A. Fleury, and H. Darmency, ‘‘Gene Dispersal from Transgenic Crops: Hybridization Between Oilseed Rape and the Wild Hoary Mustard,’’ Sexual Plant Reproduction 9 (1996), 189–196.\nSo please refrain from making statements like “It’s a wholly uncontroversial comment—at least among scientists.” That type of statement is untrue and highly misleading. As you can see from the large number of peer reviewed studies I just produced, there are many scientists across a variety of disciplines who are very concerned about the impact of GMOs on our health and the environment.\nAs many of you know, this debate is heating up with the impending vote to occur in California where people from that state will be able to cast their ballot for or against labeling of genetically modified foods. What happens in California has huge implications across the US. What happens there will set the precedent for what happens nationally.\nI hope I have shown you that there are a lot of concerns regarding GMOs in their current state. If you agree and wish to do your part to allow concerned citizens to at least have a choice, then support the Right To Now campaign. Go here to learn more about it: http://www.carighttoknow.org/.\nWe’ve got one shot at this.

{"text": "Some of our customers may have noticed a new fresh goat milk cheese in our cases. Carolyn Hillman, our go-to fresh chèvre producer for many years, is taking a hiatus from production for the next year or so. While heartbroken about this absence, I am thrilled to be able to support another grande dame of Massachusetts cheesemaking – Susan Sellew of Rawson Brook Farm. Susan is entering her 30th year of production!\nIn October, fellow cheesemongers, Ross, Tripp and I spent an afternoon with Susan at her farm in Monterey, MA. Tucked in the Berkshire hills, it was a rainy afternoon and the goats didn’t want to leave the shelter of the barn. Inquisitive and friendly – we fell in love with them immediately.\nThe goats are milked on something that looks a bit like a merry-go-round. Old army helmets serve as feed bowls while they wait their turn. Susan milks the goats three at a time, causing them less stress and keeping the quality of the milk extremely high. The fresh milk is quickly moved to the vat, and transformed into curd. The curds are hung in cheesecloth to drain out the whey. Susan’s fresh goat cheese is exceptional: light, fresh, tangy – a fluffier texture than Carolyn’s, but equally delicious. There is a clean, balanced salt and a mouthwatering finish.\nSusan manages her goats on a seasonal basis and doesn’t interfere with their natural breeding cycles. As a result, cheese is made from approximately the first of April through mid-December. After the goats are bred in October, milk and, subsequently, cheese production starts a steady decline. This is followed by a short dry spell until the goats give birth, and fresh milk is once again readily available. Rawson Brook Farm is very small, and Susan’s cheese is not commonly found outside of the Berkshires. We feel lucky that she has decided to share a portion of her production with us.\nThe Berkshire Food Journal made a short video about Susan several years ago that captures her spirit and philosophy about goat cheese exceptionally well.\nSarah Spira is the domestic cheese buyer and a cheesemonger at Formaggio Kitchen South End.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9bc2dc0f-3c86-4d20-9166-4507fe68677b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.formaggiokitchen.com/2013/01/15/introducing-fresh-goat-milk-cheese-from-rawson-brook-farm/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=843d76250c", "date": "2013-05-18T05:07:41Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9661030173301697, "token_count": 472, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Some of them have been very moving stories of individuals and people groups who have either recently been reached by the Gospel or stand in need of being reached.\nThis morning, the Resolution Committee and messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention took actions that confirmed that theme--every number has a story. Sadly, the numbers involved tell a sad, sad story.\nThe Resolutions Committee refused to submit my resolution on integrity in church membership to the convention for vote. As promised, I brought a motion to overrule that decision. It takes a 2/3 majority to overrule that committee. President Page gave me an opportunity to read my resolution on the floor of convention. The debate was for the most part healthy and appropriately spirited. It was very respectful.\nMy appeal for allowing the convention to consider this resolution was that we had just passed a resolution calling for corporate repentance and \"every number has a story.\" I read the statistics again from our Annual Church Profiles. I emphasized the fact even in the most generous analysis only 37% of our members even care enough to attend a worship gathering once a week. I have addressed the shame of this statistic repeatedly and will not belabor the point again here.\nThe chairman of the Resolutions Committee, Gerald Harris, responded to my appeal by saying that the committee thought it inappropriate to bring my resolution before the body because they feared it would infringe on the auntomy of local churches. We should not try to tell churches what to do, he said. Well, anyone who read my resolution and the resolutions that were passed this year and other years will recognize that this argument holds no water. However, it is a tremendous advance over last year's response from the chairman that, if churches took my resolution seriously we would lose our most promising prospects for evangelism!\nThe convention failed to overturn the committee and therefore my resolution never formally came before them for a vote. Several people--of various theological persuasions--came up to me afterwards to express appreciation for the attempt and dismay over the failure of the committee and convention to allow the resolution to be considered. While I am disappointed by these events and, quite honestly, surprised, I am in no way despondent! Think about it, for two years in a row a resolution calling for integrity in church membership has been read on the floor of the Southern Baptist Convention. We have discussed these matters. What the discussion has exposed is just how spiritually sick we are. While I don't like the fact that we are spiritually ill, I rejoice that this is being made increasingly apparent. Until we admit we have a problem, we will never seek to address it. In other words, until we see our sin, we will never repent of our sin.\nI am encouraged because this conversation will continue for another year and, as promised, I will, by God's grace, be in Indianapolis next year to submit the same resolution. The passing of my resolution is not the goal. The goal is the recovery of the Gospel and reformation of local churches. If the events surrounding the efforts to get this resolution before the SBC can contribute to that by shining the light on how desperately sick we are, then praise God!", "id": "<urn:uuid:13058c49-798e-46fd-8b64-81831f151ba3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.founders.org/2007/06/every-number-has-story.html?showComment=1181865660000", "date": "2013-05-18T07:26:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.969588041305542, "token_count": 683, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "As you’ve probably seen already, I’ve started releasing some bits and pieces of information related to SharePoint 2013 already. As a huge fan of SharePoint Designer workflows (I’ve written two books and recorded 20+ hours of USPJ Academy lectures on this topic alone), I’ve been paying extra attention to how SharePoint Designer 2013 will handle workflows.\nIn a previous post, I wrote about how SharePoint Designer 2013 will finally support loops, a feature that so many people have implemented in so many risky ways that I guess the Redmondians just had to do something.\nApparently, they have been listening to more than just the loopy, pun intended, loop developers, because there are more cool features on the ‘To-Do’ list of SharePoint Designer 2013.\nThere’s a new action/activity in SharePoint Designer 2013 called the Stage. It’s an activity like the loop or the steps (regular step and impersonation step), what are called container activities in workflow, and this leads me to speculate that SharePoint Designer 2013 will indeed also include support for state machine workflows.\nThis will either make you giddy with anticipation, somewhat confused, or completely unaffected. The first two are good, the latter just shows you’re ignorant, which isn’t a good thing…\nIf you’re confused, well, let me give you the quick overview of why state machine workflows are incredibly cool and how their introduction to SharePoint Designer 2013 workflows will completely change your life forever. Oh, and if you’re already giddy with anticipation, that’s likely because you know how cool state machines really are\nState Machine Workflows?\nIn short, state machines are groups of ‘normal’ (called sequential) workflows. These workflows are called states in state machine terminology. At the end of each of these state workflows, the workflow jumps into another state as determined by the logic of the completed state.\nThe cool factor here is the ability of state machines to adapt to changing conditions. In a sequential workflow, everything in the workflow happens in a rather one-way direction; from start to finish. Granted, you can have simple branching, but there’s no way to go back to a previous step, for example if you require a second approval in an approval workflow.\nState machines allow you do jump between these states, for example between “Get approval” and “Implement suggestions” states, as many times as are required. Not just that, but you can also jump between any states of the state machine, for example if your business logic requires multiple levels of approval.\nA scenario may be an editorial process like the one we have in SharePoint Magazine (albeit very simplified for this example):\n- Author submits article. At the end, move to step 2.\n- Editor reviews article. If approved, move to step 3. If not approved, suggest changes and move to step 1.\n- Copy editor works on article. If approved, move to step 4. If not approved, suggest changes and move to step 1.\n- Layout editor makes pretty things. Once completed, move to step 5.\n- Publisher sets up publishing schedule. If everything is OK, complete workflow. If changes are required, suggest changes and move to step 1.\nFrom this logic you can see that an article goes back and forth between ‘states’ of completion. This is a much more human acceptable method of working and allows the humans to make decisions without having to restart or even redesign a workflow to get the required outcome.\nWouldn’t it be swell if these state machines were indeed supported by SharePoint Designer 2013? Well, beyond the introduction of the Stage activity, there is another factor that leads me to believe that state machines are indeed coming, but I’ll save that for the next (or a later) article on rumors around SharePoint 2013\nPS: Keep in mind, these are just rumors. I believe my sources are credible, and considering who they are, I have no reason to distrust their information, but you have nothing beyond wild speculation on which to base your opinion of this information. Do not make important decisions based on rumors.\nFound this article valuable? Want to show your appreciation?

{"text": "I live in Dallas, Texas, home of the Cowboys. I grew up half Houston Oiler and half Atlanta Falcon, with a minor Phoenix Cardinals stint. I chose the New York Jets over the Giants when I lived in The Big Apple. Now what in the world do I wear to watch the Super Bowl?\nWhat are you wearing?\nI don’t like the Green Bay Packers or the Pittsburgh Steelers. I will not cheer for Roethlisberger. I respect Aaron Rodgers. All of my team options are out. Who do I wave my spirit fingers for in a couple weeks?\nI have the answer for all of you out there.\nI wrote a blog about NFL Gameday Fashion a bit back. I wrote that Tebow fans should support him in FL gear instead of whichever team colors he currently sports – unless of course they’re already fans of said team. It’s the premise Fantasy Leagues exist upon. You cheer on individual players over an entire team – again, unless of course you’re already a fan of said team.\nSince my favorite sport is NCAA College Football, this makes it easy. I’ve spent every Fall since high school wearing red and black for the UGA Bulldawgs! I love me some Matthew Stafford. I don’t care about the Detroit Lions whatsoever. But when he’s lobbing passes, I’m cheering. I met Vince Young on Draft Night at Marquee in NYC, as well as cheered the Longhorns all season. (I grew up with a Father in burnt orange every weekend). He’s a gentleman – with a few minor tantrums - and is a splendid athlete. I’ve cheered for him at Tennessee and may end up cheering for him as a…Viking? Don’t care for either team as a whole.\nThink about it. You know you have favorite players that have changed teams over the years. Do you just abandon them? Or do you still kind of follow them throughout the season, albeit, continuing to cheer on your entire favorite team.\nIn addition to my boys spread across teams from coast to coast I cheer for the Cowboys. Am I bandwagon? Let’s just say I didn’t grow up loving them, but I’ve enjoyed watching them for 12 years now. But even on the team, I have favorite and not-so-favorite players.\nAll of this brings me back to my initial question – what do I wear on Sunday February 6th? Well, I’ll tell you.\nRed and blue.\nWhat?! Yes, red and blue. Two words: Emmanuel Sanders. Pony Up. I’m not cheering for the Packers or the Steelers. Whoever wins, wins. But my boy and fellow SMU alum will get my full support on Gameday. I will be maintaining my player loyalty. I even had a customer come in admitting her son, a Longhorn fan, is cheering for the Packers because of Jermichael Finley. No other reason.\nIf you want to jump on and support a team, do it. And look good doing so. You should probably stop in Gameday Cloth to make certain you’re looking your sports fashion best; especially since the pressure is on with all the millions of visiting fans to DFW. But otherwise, pick a player and rock out their college colors. We could probably keep you fashionable for that choice too.\nRed and blue.

{"text": "With summer just around the corner, many homeowners are contemplating the efficiency of their central air conditioning systems, including how efficiently the ductwork delivers conditioned air to various parts of the house. But there’s another aspect of air distribution that’s just as important to your home comfort levels. It’s vital that your home also have functioning return-air ducts to provide complete circulation of the air in your home.Without properly placed return-air ducts, the air in your home, especially on the upper floors, can become stale and hot. Several problems can crop up with your return-air ducts.\nBefore you check the return-air ducts themselves, you should make sure the air conditioning system is actually sending air to the rooms you’re concerned about. Otherwise, you will waste time checking the return-air ducts when the problem lies elsewhere. Check the air supply registers to make sure they are not closed and that nothing is blocking them. Also, check the dampers to make sure that they’re not closed.\nSince warm air rises in a home, to get the best use out of return-air ducts they must be located correctly. If you have a second floor, they should be on that floor. Placement within the rooms is also important. The return-air ducts should be placed on the wall near the ceiling. Otherwise, you are just returning cool air.\nReturn-air ducts must have a free flow of air. Make sure that nothing, such as wallpaper, pictures or furniture, is blocking them. In addition, the holes for the return-air ducts have to be large enough to allow the air to flow easily. If a room that seems stale does not have a return-air duct, install a grill to allow air to flow to another room that does have one.\nKeeping the air in your Northeast Ohio home cool and fresh will make it more enjoyable for you and your family this summer.

I’m a child of the 90’s.\nYou’re best known for your work in fashion design, but what do you consider your greatest talent?\nPig training! I grew up in the country, raised animals and my favorite animals were my pigs. I had to train them in order to show and sell them at the local county fair. I bought my first car with my pig cash at the age of 15.\nWhat’s your daily habit?\n5am coffee and exercise: gym, yoga or a walk.\nWhat’s one thing in your closet you could never give up?

{"text": "Cooking classes in Skamokawa\nWould you like to learn to bake bread like those gorgeous loaves in the picture? If so, you are in luck. Kitty and Don Speranza, a pair of talented and passionate cooks who own The Inn at Crippen Creek Farm in Skamokawa, WA, are now offering cooking classes to the community as well as their overnight guests.\nBefore moving out to eventinierTown, Don and Kitty owned and operated Mangiamo! Catering and Italian Eatery in Portland, Oregon. Their bread is such a huge hit at the Two Island Farm Market on Puget Island in Cathlamet, WA during the summer months that they started a bread subscription service to keep their customers happy in the off-season. (Ahem, their bread is so good that I buy their focaccia all summer long instead of making my own.)\nClasses vary from a 2-3 hour course to an immersion weekend for 2 or 3 couples with accommodations at the Inn. Current topics include Artisan Bread Baking, Italian Country Cooking, Pizza and Calzone, and Quick Classic Pasta Sauces.\nOne of the coolest things about these classes is that couples booking a weekend stay may collaborate with the chef for a particular theme. How much fun would that be? I'd have to put together a dessert class so that I could get Don's tips on the dessert buffet he served for a post-concert party at the Inn last weekend: New York cheesecake with fresh lemon curd, chocolate cake with chocolate panna cotta 'frosting', and Don's signature tiramisu...maybe Kitty's cinnamon rolls too.\nThe current class schedule includes:\n- Beginning Artisan Bread Baking - Saturday, January 26, 2008 11am until 1:30 pm $50 (includes pizza luncheon)\n- Quick Classic Pasta Sauces - Saturday, February 2, 2008 6-8:30 pm $65 (includes pasta dinner)\n- Beginning Artisan Bread Baking - Saturday, February 16, 2008 11am until 1:30 pm $50 (includes pizza luncheon)\nLess than two hours from Portland and about three from Seattle, a weekend at the Inn with bread baking lessons (and maybe a romantic dinner) might be just the Valentine's gift you have been looking for.", "id": "<urn:uuid:ae407796-5399-4943-96b7-26c7ec0f9fa2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.kitchenmage.com/2008/01/cooking-classes.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9496380090713501, "token_count": 477, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Tuesday, November 23, 2010\nHow to knit combination style\nBut unlike Continental knitters, I purl using the Eastern purl technique. Annie Modesitt offers a nice tutorial about Eastern purling, which allows you to quickly purl by scooping up yarn held with your left hand in the front of your work. This marriage between Continental knitting and Eastern purling is aptly called Combination knitting. I have made a very homespun (that's a nice word for it!) video showing my technique.\nIf my video doesn't do it for you, check out Annie Modesitt's video. Her hand movements look different from mine; it looks like she still throws her knit stitches and I do not.\nThe bottom line is that there isn't a right way to knit and purl. Whatever works for you is the right way to knit. So experiment. That's how I came to my particular knitting techniques. I looked for the smallest movements possible to make knit and purl stitches and adapted my technique accordingly. I encourage you to do the same. And as always, practice, practice, practice. In both knitting and in life, it makes all the difference.", "id": "<urn:uuid:26ccfef0-52a2-418e-93d4-d3fcbf0c7816>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.knittingatlarge.com/2010/11/how-to-knit-combination-style.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:39Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9532325267791748, "token_count": 237, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Sixpack mobile applications is a young, fast growing and trend-setting business specializing in mobile e-commerce. Sixpack creates, develops and supplies mobile applications for customers, and builds mobile shops for e-commerce retailers. The company currently solely operates in the Netherlands, but has ambitions to expand throughout Europe.\nSixpack boasts an impressive profile of 40 apps that have generated more than 3.5 million downloads. The company offers its customers a ‘one stop, turnkey mobile app solution’ and already supplies brands such as Autotrader, Lenco and ADP.\nOnline shopping has taken off in a big way as people increasingly favor shopping from the comfort of their own home, at a time that suits them. In addition, the popularity of smartphones and tablet devices has spurred a rise in m-commerce, allowing consumers to order products on the move, wherever they are.\nAs online sites are core to Sixpack’s operations, ensuring that the connection is stable, secure, flexible and quick was of utmost importance. Firstly the brands whose mobile apps were developed by Sixpack needed to have a stable and resilient connection to ensure customers could simply buy products. In e-commerce, the inability to process transactions means lost revenue for each minute that goes by as customers will soon switch sites if they feel their needs are not quickly met. For this reason, Sixpack needed a hosting provider that would have the appropriate resources to fix hardware problems as soon as they occur so that transactions would not be compromised.\nSecondly, as customers would be required to enter their confidential payment details, it was essential that all transactions be kept safe and secure. Sixpack needed to be confident that all information is stored safely, securely and is backed up, with the reassurance that sites and user details would not be compromised internally or externally.\nThe third challenge was the rise and fall of traffic to online shopping sites in line with consumer demand, resulting in peaks around key shopping times such as Christmas. Sixpack therefore needed its IT infrastructure to be flexible and scalable to support these fluctuations in traffic. The scalable and flexible option would ensure that there was an optimum page download speed and virtually no downtime on the site, to provide the best customer experience possible.\nAs Sixpack was planning to build mobile apps in Germany – and possibly other European countries – the hosting provider also needed to operate from a wider base than just the Netherlands.\nHaving researched the marketplace and received a number of recommendations, Sixpack chose specialist hosting provider, LeaseWeb.\nSixpack believed that LeaseWeb’s reputation for stability and security made it the ideal partner for helping the company to service retail customers. With it’s the global network ranking among the best in the world, LeaseWeb has a highly redundant design, good connectivity and a number of different possibilities for selecting internet paths. LeaseWeb offered a highly responsive support team who would maintain a watchful eye over the network and address problems before they could cause an issue and breakdown of a service. In addition, LeaseWeb could provide the scalability that was needed in order to handle peaks and troughs in traffic to online shopping sites.\nSixpack also believed LeaseWeb to be the perfect partner to assist with the planned expansion of the Sixpack brand; indeed the team felt that in their attempt to increase their presence across Europe, being in partnership with a respected and recognized global brand would be invaluable.\nBoudewijn Verkerk, CEO of Sixpack said: “As we work towards expanding into Germany and France next year, LeaseWeb can provide the European coverage that will facilitate our growth. Similarly the scale of LeaseWeb means that it is better suited to accommodate our planned growth than in-house servers would be.”\nSixpack has now been working with LeaseWeb since November 2011. During that time, Sixpack has experienced zero downtime.\n“We are very impressed with the service and products that LeaseWeb has provided us with. We feel secure in knowing that LeaseWeb is a trusted supplier for us. Furthermore, that fact that existing and potential customers of theirs have been impressed with the quality of service fills us with confidence. We feel very optimistic about the future of our partnership, and are highly encouraged by LeaseWeb’s shared enthusiasm in m-Commerce.”\nWe have many interesting case studies about our customers, so head over to our website if you would like to know more!", "id": "<urn:uuid:3570c7a8-74ef-4e0b-ba60-8d439d987c1c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.leaseweb.com/2012/07/16/sixpack-mobile-applications-and-leaseweb-scalability-and-reliability-in-m-commerce/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:30:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9680758714675903, "token_count": 907, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "In 2006, two scientists announced that they had cooked an egg by placing it in between two cell phones. It has been thrououghly disproven and analyzed since the surface of the claim, but it is still an excellent opportunity to use the Scientific Thinking Principles on!\n#1: Ruling Out Rival Hypotheses\nThis principle isn't the most relevant because the experiment doesn't exactly prove any hypotheses. But it can still apply to the attempt to cook an egg between two cell phones because there could be other effects causing that outcome.\n#2: Correlation vs. Causation\nThere are so many other reasons that the egg could've cooked! Maybe it was really hot out? Or the cell phone egg set up was within a microwave? Not the most probable of all possible causations, but it proves the point. There could be many other ways this egg could've cooked (or in actuality, the fact that it didn't cook at all) that we need to examine or at least acknowledge that they could be there.\nThis claim is very out there so it has a really good chance of being able to be falsified. As we will see in #4, after replicating the incident one can find almost instantly that it is in fact a hoax.\nAs many people did, reproducing the egg cooking experiement will prove that it is in fact a hoax. Every reproduction that was prodcued failed to yield the same results as the first, which made everything make sense when the site's webmaster that published the article stepped forward to say it was in fact completely fake.\n#5: Extraordinary Claims\nThe claim that you can cook an egg with two cell phones is pretty extraordinary yet there is no extraordinary evidence to back it up! In fact, it is just too extraordinary to be real.\n#6: Occam's Razor\nIn my mind, the simpliest explaination would be that it simply is not true. The end.\nI'm not going to lie, if this claim was true I would be thrilled. In addition to being in awe of the power of technology, it would make cooking meals for myself in my dorm room a whole lot easier! Unfortunately though, this is a hoax.

As a history lover, I greatly enjoyed reading these primary source documents, trying to figure out what the different words could be, and deciphering the context of the letter. I discovered that it was much easier to read the younger sons’ letters, because they had much neater cursive than their father did. It’s possible that Patrick Barry Hayes spent much of his time writing to Elizabeth while at sea, which could account for some of the jarring script that made much of his letters illegible. In contrast, his sons’ handwriting was easy to read, and they used more modern vocabulary than their father did.\nHaving the opportunity to read personal letters from the early 19th century was fascinating for me. It was like reading a diary, but with multiple perspectives and a great deal of guessing about missing information between dates and locations. I enjoyed learning that one son had reunited with his love, and had written to her father to ask for her hand in marriage. I was worried for the son who was away at school for the first time, was ill, and clearly homesick for his mother. While these letters were written almost 200 years ago, the thoughts and feelings they related were contemporary and relatable.\nThank you to Michael Foight and Laura Bang for sharing their knowledge and advice, and providing me with the opportunity to learn about and work with digital libraries. I enjoyed seeing the “other side” of the digital library process, and look forward to using this experience in future digital projects!\nEditorial Note: These transcriptions are in the process of being attached to the digital images and will be available for the public in the near future.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9c92d62b-cbdd-433e-bc31-4fc417d15a2e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.library.villanova.edu/digitallibrary/category/patrick-hayes/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:26Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9873002767562866, "token_count": 433, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "I recently attended a talk by e.E. Charlton-Trujillo at the Central and Southern Ohio SCBWI. Charlton-Trujillo burst into the children's writing scene when her debut novel, Prizefighter en Mi Casa, won the Delacorte Dell Yearling Award in 2004. Her second book, Feels Like Home, was published in 2007.\nAlthough she's a successful novelist, Charlton Trujillo's background is in film. Her current project is a paranormal TV series called Fallen. At her talk, in addition to telling us about her publishing journey, she passed along some tips for videoblogging and making book trailers. Here they are.\n1. Network and make friends with photographers, musicians, and videographers. They will be very helpful when you decide to make book trailers. New musicians might be willing to let you use their music, for the exposure.\n2. If you're on a budget, consider hiring a college film student. They will work for a lower rate if they can use the trailer in their demo reel.\n3. Or, get your readers involved and hold a competition for them to make their own trailer.\n4. If you have a picture book, your job is half done. They have pictures!\n5. For easy video blogging, try a Flip camera or Kodak's Zi8. If you want absolute, full proof ease, go with the Flip. For slightly more control but with the same amount of ease in transfer to your computer, the Kodak Zi8 is your best bet in the pocket cam realm.

{"text": "My good pals William and Lia brought us back us back some goodies from Japan (aka, my dream destination). In this bag of goodies were a couple satchels of this cat tea. Not being able to read Japanese, I wondered, is this tea for a cat? Is it for me? Is it for both of us? What is this? I mean there’s a cat on the front who looks like they are drinking some tea – really? What kind of tea is this? So a quick text sent to my friend Saya who is from Japan confirmed this is in fact tea for your cat. Not any type of tea – this is CATNIP TEA. I know, take a second to think about this.. So I opened up the package and inside was just one tea bag – very catnip smelling by the way. How catnip smelling? FiFi Bofinkles showed up to smell it. Then I confirmed with Saya the amount of water (16 ounces), temperature (hot or cold would work) and then I made it. I used 8 ounces cold, 8 ounces warm water. I let it cool down to room temperature. You can see it turned a slight yellow/green color while steeping. Omg guys, I’m steeping tea for my cats. I question my sanity. Then I put it into a bowl because I thought a tea cup might cross the line for me…. And I waited. FiFi Bofinkles showed up first. She wasn’t interested. She knew the smell but in liquid form? Not having it. She moved away to a food bowl and ate instead. The real girl I was waiting for was Essy. Essy is catnip obsessed, I’m sure some would say she needs to rehabilitated or needs a detox. Girl likes her nip. She’s 19.. she does what she wants. I left the bowl for a few minutes and Matthew called out “Is Essy ok?” I walked over and Essy was laying on the ground rolling around, rubbing her paws into her cheeks. “She’s all wet” Matthew said feeling her face. ESSY HAS A TEA FACE. That sneaky girl. So Essy was really feeling the magic of the catnip tea. She was doing her stretches and rolling movements when she’s under the influence. Then I played with her and she bit my finger because she probably thought it was a dinosaur. She felt good. I waited until she went back to the tea and she did. Where she then slid her cheeks all over the bowl, inside the bowl, dipped her chin. Basically she bobbed for tea. After rubbing her cheeks in the tea some more, she just stood there and stared at her Dora the Explorer plate. I wish I could know what was going through her head during those 36 minutes of non movement. Was Dora talking to her? Was she plotting to hurt Dora? Was she living in a animated rainbow? Who knows. 20 minutes later, she was still here. I rubbed her face and she was soaked. I’m pretty sure she just put her head in it, so in fear of Essy drowning in catnip tea, I removed it. The tea bowl was full of Essy fur.\nIf you can get this, I would try it. I have a few more teabags that I will let Brother and Xanadu try. Just watch out for Essy!\nToday our beloved Essy Francis turns 19 years old! Essy is the shining sun in my life, the stars in my sky, my heart pitter-pattering. I love her dearly. Happy Birthday Essy Mom Cookie Bear! You can have unlimited Fancy Feast and white bread all day today! Essy received special emails, tweets and voicemails on her birthday! <3 This is Essy when she was 1! What a cute baby. Have a great day Essy. Relax with some catnip!\nThis is a tale of FiFi Bofinkles and the telephone. As soon as I get on the telephone, Bofinkles jumps on my lap. Bofinkles doesn’t understand I’m on the telephone, she think it means “Bofinkles Time”. Example from today: Me on the telphone “Hey, how are you doing?” and continues conversation… Bofinkles sprints over, jumps on my lap “What Mom? Do you need me”?” Bofinkles: “Hey, I’m talking to you. Do you need me, do you?” Bofinkles: “Ok, I am getting closer to you. I will jump on your shoulder. Are you talking to me?” Bofinkles: “Why aren’t you responding to me standing here, looking at you? Maybe if I pretend I fell asleep while you were talking to me you would notice..” Bofinkles: “PLEASE JUST RUB MY CHEEKS! PLEASE!” Bofinkles: “Ok, so about that conversation we were having. How are you?” Bofinkles: “Omg, are you ignoring me again? What If I just fall down..?” Bofinkles: “Just look at me. Please!”\nFiFi Bofinkles lets you know when she’s arrived. Right now I know she’s here because she’s sprawled out in my lap, paws pressed into my leg, tail wrapped around my waist, occasionally batting her eyelashes at me when I need to rub her belly harder. When Bofinks arrived we quickly learned she doesn’t just lay in a area, she exists in that area, she becomes that area. She’s not one to curl up into a ball, instead she likes to stretch it all out. If you’re in the way, oh well, you’re going to have a Bofinks legs on top of you then. This is her life: When I wake up in the morning, either there’s a Bofinks on my head, or she’s sharing (that means I get 20%, she gets 80%) my pillow. I see her bright green eyes just staring at me. She’s slightly in a daze, wondering if she really wants to wake up or should go back to sleep for a few more hours. I slip out of bed very slowly, bending my legs in ways that I didn’t think were possible just so I don’t make Bofinks uncomfortable and angry. When I finally somersault onto the floor, I get up and look at her. She’s made herself more comfortable and has slipped under the comforter. Is this a person or a cat? When she finally wakes up, I kiss her, I hug her. I wrap my arms around Bofinks and Xanadu at the same time and make them both angry. I am very happy though. The sun hits, the cats move themselves every hour to catch the sun directly. Bofinks has this down to a science. She’s laying on paint brushes, her bright pink belly is out, she doesn’t have a care in the world. I give her belly a rub, she flexes her paws at me to thank me but doesn’t open a eye. It’s bed time. I come back into the bedroom. It appears Bofinks decided to crash early this evening. Somehow she’s slipped under a blanket and needs an entire bed for all 8 pounds of her. I try to lay in the area above her head, all 10 inches of it but I’m bigger than that. Bofinks doesn’t care. I try to push her over, but she glares at me. Finally she rumbles a bit, rolls her eyes, and gives me another few inches that she thinks is acceptable to sleep in. Are you comfortable Baby Bofinks? I hope so. She’s all tucked in, goodnight girl.\nXanadu Pluto is our 6 year old crazy Siamese. Even though she’s hands down the smallest cat in the family, she’s most definitely the boss and monitors the rest of the Meowza family. A few days ago we caught her on live stream when we weren’t home just sitting next to the door guarding the bowls. Does she not allow anyone to eat while we’re gone? She would sit there very proud and occasionally run after something, most likely FiFi Bofinkles. A few days ago after my mission to find new Halloween decorations I came home with this cute pumpkin rug. I put it down and waited… 3.4 seconds later, Xanadu was on it claiming it as her own. Sometimes she wraps herself up completely in it and gets stuck. I will try to get a picture of that. Have paperwork? Don’t worry, Xanadu will lay on it and take care of it. The only one she has to watch out for is Brother, he’s not very scared of her at all. Sometimes they lay like this (by the way notice how bigger Brother is than her) and Xanadu attempts to stick her head under his tail. Then he whips his tail and continues to hit her in the head. She closes her eyes and enjoys every moment of it.\nLet me introduce you to the love glove. It’s a glove which will cause alot of love to your furry cats. Essy is 18, she knows what she wants and what she doesn’t like. One thing she doesn’t like is being brushed, she hisses at the furminator and brushes in general. This causes a problem because she sheds crazily. One thing she loves though is being rubbed and petted with your hand. She can lay there for hours with your hand on her belly between her arms. In fact just as I typed the last sentence, Essy who is across the room met my glance, jumped off her chair, plopped on the floor and stretched it out with a “come and get me” nod. I’ll be right there babe. So here comes the love glove, it’s basically a brush that you wear, so cats feel your hand rubbing them, not that brush they hate. We just got it and tested it on 4 of our critters, it’s a sensation. All the cats are begging for it, they stretch out as soon as they see it, they purr, they rub, they cry out in happiness. It was a bit intense to watch them get all these emotions. Essy loves to put her chin on the ground and get ear and head rubs with it. Xanadu plops upside down completely and likes it on her belly rough. FiFi Bofinkles likes it on her head all the way to her tail, knocking over anything in the process and completely furring up my monitor as she rubs her fresh fur body all over it. Brother Bear likes it to relax. If you have cats, try it out! You’ll cause lots of purring. Bofinkles about to pass out. Xanadu passed out. Essy looks like she has a beret on. All this from just a few quick rubs on each cat. Life changing.\nIn just 2 months, our little (who is actually the biggest kid in the Meowza family) Brother Bear will be 3 years old already! Everyday we watch his personality continue to change. Brother came from a shelter in the Bronx and when we first got him, he was not very friendly. He was scared, ready to attack and we imagine came from not a good place where he wasn’t treated right. Over the time we’ve had him, with the numerous vet visits for many conditions, this guy just keeps warming our heart everyday. He’s grown from not wanting to be touched at all, to one who begs for head bumps, ankle rubs, and will jump up with us in bed and curl up on my feet. I read one of the biggest Maine Coon characteristics is their “goofy” personality. I never thought Brother would become it, but he’s turned into a pure goof ball. From the laps he runs which ends in him sliding into his condominium house, sliding 10 feet, crashing into the wall, to the way he rubs his tongue all over plastic to his side head glances he does when he’s surprised, to the way he hides under the bed whenever there’s a hint of a storm, he’s one silly and sweet man. He is the youngest in the family, but being 14 pounds has him as the biggest as well. Even though he could easily pin down any of the girls, he never hurts them, ever. He lays near them, he follows them, he lines up behind Essy when it’s eating time so she can eat first (even though he shouldn’t be eating her food to begin with, but that’s another story), he lets them all pick their beds and always gets stuck with the smallest bed that’s left, he’s such a gentleman. Every morning when I wake up, he gives a big baby meow (very soft voice) as soon as I swing my legs out of bed, then he follows me out the bedroom, and will continue with me until I plop down on my computer. There he will sit next to me on the floor, or on my toes (in the winter, this is great – furry belly to keep me warm!) and just stare at me, feeling safe that he’s next to me. If I have to go to the other side of the room, he will follow. Right now he’s a few feet away, looking up at me.. I’m looking back at him telling him such a great boy he is and how much we love him. We love Brother Bear.\nNote his mini Santa beard he’s slowly starting to grow…\nLove this guy so much.\nThe surprised side glance he does.\nThis is the first picture ever taken of him when he came here. He ran under the bed, and finally I got him to reach a arm out to grab a ball and go back under the bed with it. We’ve come a long way.\nDid you know our 18 year old girl Essy has a blog? She’s the queen of the house, the apple of our eyes, the love of our lives. She’s been blogging since 2006, there’s lots of sunning pictures, food pictures, sleeping pictures and just general stare downs. Check it out here, or you can always check it out in the sidebar over there ——————————->\nHey Mom, how are you doing? Just sitting with my paws over the edge. It’s comfy. Boy, am I tired! Can I get a kiss? Where’s Xanadu? Oh there she is.. Let me lay on a desk and mess all your documents up, it’s totally ok. I have a nice pink belly, would you like to rub it? Why is everyone sleeping behind me? Ok, I guess I will sleep too.. When you are ready for bed, I’ll be here waiting for you with my paws crossed like a gentleman.\nWe have a cat door on our bedroom door. We originally installed it to keep the air conditioning in so we could keep our door closed at night. Xanadu had no problem going in and out, Brother either. Essy doesn’t really go into the bedroom much but if needed she will go through that cat door at full speed so it shakes on its hinges. FiFi Bofinkles though, she doesn’t really get cat doors, she doesn’t understand why she has to press her nose against something to open it so usually she just pounds on the door at night with her paws until I wake up, open the door, pick her up and insert her onto my pillow, followed by a nice love tap on the head which then causes her to close her eyes and curl her toes.\nBut that door broke.\nIt was installed for years, was kind of cheap plastic, and Xanadu and Brother fist fought on opposite sides of the door too much. Plus Brother squeezed his big 14 pound body through that door so many times I think it shortened the lifespan. So that led to just a cat door frame with no actual door.\nBut that all changed today. Let me introduce you to the TubbyKat Door. This cat door is for big cats up to 25 pounds. That means Brother can grow some more and still fit in! This door is monster, it looks like a mack truck. The best part is there is a magnet at the base, which means the flap door always closes after a kitty enters or leaves.\nWe just installed it and Xanadu was our first victim. It took her a few minutes to wonder what was going on and how was she going to get in. She tried to ignore the cat door and just use her paws to open the door like a human would (her preferred method, she’s way too smart). She could see us, we could see her. Eventually she went through which caused us to clap and yell “hooray” which caused Xanadu to drop to the floor and look terrified.\nSo we immediately left and Xanadu was like “What? I just got in and now you guys leave. This isn’t funny.” Eventually it took her so long to get out the door I had to bribe her with pieces of my ham sandwich. She came out.\nBrother has not tried it yet, although I’m sure smiles will ensue.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8ab607da-fd3f-41d9-a070-7296c1060d90>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.meowzas.com/?cat=12", "date": "2013-05-18T08:10:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.973994791507721, "token_count": 3767, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Label: Defend Music.\nMy take: Born and raised in Detroit, The Silent Years are one of Michigan's most celebrated contemporary bands. This is their third release to date and brings beautiful orchestration to new highs with its earnest, almost organic sound. Each track is gorgeous -- a blend of symphonies, strong rock guitar riffs, gentle banjos and pianos -- creating a juxtaposition of heavy and light, soft and dark that makes the album well rounded. This is a great album from a great Michigan band -- learn them, love them.\nLabel: 4AD Records.\nGenre: Pop/dream pop.\nMy take: Stereolab is a WIDR-FM staple band and it's more than a pleasure to introduce you to their 11th album. This time the group keeps up with its whimsical, dream-pop sound inspired by '70s pop and '60s psychedelic. The music is just as good as ever, with beautiful brass and string arrangements, quirky keyboard arrangements and -- as always -- the angelic voice of Laetitia Sadier, who sings in both English and French. Critics are calling this album their most focused work to date, and I agree.\nLabel: Marriage Records.\nMy take: White Fang is a young band whose 19-year-old frontman seems wise beyond his years when it comes to great punk-rock. White Fang's sound is a combination of island-inspired punk with rousing chants, trumpets, congas and a casaba to create a sound that lies somewhere between Vampire Weekend and the Mae Shi. It's energetic and rambunctious but without having the lame \"teen angst\" vibe. Rather than punching these teens, you'd want to hang out with them. One thing is for sure: This album isn't just for the kiddies.\n\"F Monday Orange February Venus Lunatic 1 or 13\"\nLabel: Great Society Music.\nMy take: Colourmusic is a very odd band, almost unclassifiable. The group's sound is a mixture between Oklahoma rockabilly, pop and rock. Large choruses, alt-country guitar picking and quirky percussion makes this album fun -- think the Polyphonic Spree meets The Flaming Lips with a little bit of Okkervil River. The band's inspiration comes from Isaac Newton's theory on the relationship between color and sound, having all their songs represent a particular color. This band also is known for its theatrical, audience-participation-oriented shows. From hearing this album, you'll be itching to find out what those shows are all about.\n\"You and Me\"\nLabel: Gigantic Music.\nGenre: Garage rock.\nMy take: The Walkmen are known for their more sophisticated version of garage rock. This album is still quite raw and lo-fi, but pianos and brass sections are implemented. This album is one of their best works to date. These brooding yet romantic songs are vibrant and dramatic, filled with brash expression. The album is filled with versatility, and has its fair share of slower love songs that almost have a DeVotchKa-like quality.", "id": "<urn:uuid:75b10676-515c-44ce-afe8-47d650edac28>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.mlive.com/kalamazoo_gazette_extra/2008/08/widrs_top_5_65.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:51:20Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9570828676223755, "token_count": 651, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "How To Win At Science Fairs (Dec, 1960)\nHow To Win At Science Fairs\nby Ronald Benrey\nYOU CAN WIN at a Science Fair as long as one thing interests you more than winning does. This is your project itself. It is going to be judged on scientific thought, creative ability, and presentation. You will really have to know the field your project is concerned with. This takes effort. Since you lack the means of a professional laboratory, you will have to do much with little. This takes trial and error and just plain work. Your presentation must be attractive and clear. This means good workmanship, which takes time and care. You are going to have to show some originality. After all, there is no use doing what everybody else is doing: be different. For this, you have to have the other three under control. By the way, the “laymen” who see your exhibit will ask all kinds of questions. Have good answers at your fingertips. The judges won’t be laymen, and any double-talk will scream to them that you don’t know your subject. It may also make them suspect that the best parts of your project are not your work. This would be unjust, perhaps, but deadly. Now, whether your entry covers a large table top or can just be tucked under your arm, it is going to be a big job. It can’t be left for a “crash program” in the last few weeks before the Fair. It is going to eat up big portions of your time, energy, and spending money for the next several months. All this demands your interest. But it isn’t simply a matter of “fun. ” Licking this challenge may be a turning point in your life. With or without a scholarship prize, your career may begin with it.\nAs a reader of Electronics Illustrated your project will probably deal with electronics or applied physics rather than with biological or earth sciences. Select your topic carefully from a broad subject that really interests you. A massive effort in the direction of a passing fancy will result in a mediocre project at best. Take a limited subtopic that you think worth investigating and that you feel able to handle.\nTo ease financial strain, plan now to build your project over a long period of time, say six months, on a pay-as-you-build basis.\nOnce you have a rough idea of your project’s general form, don’t dash into construction.\nVisit technical libraries and learn all you can about current professional work in the field, and its technical jargon. This will give you much important information and helpful hints, and when you finally face the judges, you will know your subject.\nHere is a prickly question. It is up to you to be realistic and honest with yourself when you choose a topic. Your science teachers and advisers will certainly be helpful, but the final decision must be yours. In other words, if you have never handled a soldering iron before, don’t take on a project requiring elaborate electronic instrumentation. If you have enough time you can work up to a complex project by building a few simpler devices, like many described in EI. This is another reason for starting NOW. – Why not get your feet wet by assembling some test equipment from kits? You will certainly need a multimeter anyway, for any project, and it will be something you can use “forever. ”\nAnother touchy subject: discussion of this often scares off good potential science fairers. Nobody requires or expects a science fair project to produce a radical new scientific discovery. However, this does not imply that an entrant can’t find a new angle on an old problem. Merely duplicating a project described in a magazine shows the judges only one thing: the builder can follow directions. The main benefit of entering a science fair is the challenge of thinking a real problem out, all the way through. Your project can be for “demonstration” rather than “research, ” but make sure you come up with fresh, clear, meaningful ways to present your material. Stay away from last year’s winning project: it was good last year. Avoid “staples” (like Tesla coils) unless they are only part of a ‘wider original project.\nYour project should be well presented and look impressive, but impressive need not mean expensive. Judges seldom look twice at an exhibit loaded down with excess and borrowed equipment when the same results could have been obtained more economically and without false show. Novel use of common materials shows creative ability, and this is an important judging criterion. Remember, how you solved your problem is what counts at a science fair, and not merely that you solved it. Also, neatness counts! Aside from being impossible to troubleshoot, a rat’s nest of wiring is typical of losing projects. Time spent color-coding leads, installing wire harness and cable clamps will result in a much more attractive and more reliable project. But know what you are doing! Don’t harness leads in a circuit that demands point-to-point wiring, or cable grid and plate leads together in an amplifier circuit. Read up on layout and construction techniques, and allow yourself time to make and correct mistakes. Prior planning will also pay off in dollars and cents, since you can save by purchasing some components (like resistors) in quantity, and if you live near a big city you can shop around for some items in the military surplus stores, modifying your design if necessary to take odd-value components. Now, sit back and start your thinking. The time to start is right now.\nIS YOUR WINNING PROJECT HERE?\nRADIO TELESCOPE: Home-built sensitive low-noise receiver, simple antenna system. Try to make simple “radio map.”\nGUIDANCE SYSTEM: For model ear. Can be programmed to run around science fair grounds without hitting anything, or to reach pre-chosen destination.\nSOLAR CELLS: Home-built unit as part of demonstration of basic physics of solar cells: display on recent professional research results: off-beat practical applications (eyeglass type hearing aid?).\nMOON MOUSE: “To be landed on the Moon. ” Self-propelled, radio controlled from Earth, instrumented and transmitter equipped. Some functions solar powered ?\nThese are only suggestions.

{"text": "I’ve only been at MSPP for two months, and so far I have met some truly incredible people that I will consider life-long friends. One of those friends in my first year cohort is named Nicole, and we spend about 9 hours a week in class together. Even though class does not leave a lot of time to get to know each other, I feel like we’ve become pretty close. Nicole is one of those people that radiates positivity and genuine caring, and you feel like a better person by osmosis just sitting next to her.\nI’ve just found out recently that she has not always been this happy and positive, however. Like 1/4 of the general American population, (myself included), (statistic from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication), Nicole has struggled with mental illness. However, unlike most of us that fear the stigma, Nicole is brave enough to share her story with the world.\nNicole is a really wonderful writer, and has written and published a book about her battle with mental illness. It is a collection of short stories, poems, and various artwork about her struggles. In publishing her book, she hopes that other people battling mental illness will see that they are not alone. It is my hope in sharing her book with you, we can promote hope and continue to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness together.\nIf you are interested in reading Nicole’s story, you can purchase her book, Spoken, here.\nI am so immensely proud of my friend and classmate, not only for writing and publishing her own book during her first year of grad school, but for being such a courageous individual that is using her history of pain as motivation to get her PsyD in order to relieve the suffering of others.

In many cases, this erotic roleplay is combined with material kinks such as leather, rubber, PVC etc.\nIn this video, a man uses a female latex mask as well as constricting pantyhose to transform himself into a DAK (double-above-knee) amputee woman.

{"text": "First Herman Cain said he knew nothing about any settlements related to claims against him of sexual harassment. Then he acknowledged he did know about the settlements. Then he tried to parse the meanings of the words “settlements” and “agreements.” Then he blamed the Perry campaign for leaking the story. Then he threatened to file some sort of lawsuit against Politico, which broke the harassment story.\nWhat a mess. And the most bizarre part of Cain’s inability to deal effectively with the issue is that he knew it was going to come out. He raised it in 2003 as an opposition research issue during his failed bid for a Senate seat and he had an advance warning of 10 days before the Politico story went public.\nPart of Cain’s appeal thus far has been that he’s not a conventional candidate and isn’t running a conventional campaign. He isn’t loaded down with advisers and consultants, which — until recently — was making a virtue out of necessity since he didn’t have the money for a Romney- or Perry-style campaign.\n“Let Herman be Herman,” he says. Except when it’s clear he needs help if he wants to win.\nChris Stirewalt at Fox News has a great analogy. Cain doesn’t need all the campaign machinery, just like drivers don’t need all that safety equipment on their cars:\nThe reasons all the other campaigns have “conventional” press flacks, message gurus and other personnel is that, like anti-lock brakes, they’re just an added expense most of the time, but good to have when you need them.\nProbably no one is more surprised at the Cain campaign’s success than Herman Cain. Only he knows whether, when he announced, he was really in it to win it or if he was merely trying to parlay has immense talent into a Fox News contract or celebrity status, à la Sarah Palin.\nBut having jumped out in front of the GOP pack and with a reasonable chance of winning the nomination, he now needs to decide: Is he running a book tour, or is he running a campaign? If it’s the former, then he’s taking Republican voters for a ride and his flailing response to the sexual harassment charges really doesn’t matter much. If it’s the latter, then this week ought to serve as his final warning that it’s time to get serious.", "id": "<urn:uuid:290a6ae7-687c-4bf0-8ddc-3cb03b1ce51c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.mysanantonio.com/the-arena/2011/11/cain-disabled/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:06:57Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9742023348808289, "token_count": 516, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "It has been one year since we launched The National Archives’ blog. From the start, our writers and staff have taken a fresh look at a wide range of subjects. Our 223 posts have ranged from information management in the movies to personal stories of the First World War and Titanic, from maps to UFOs. With over 60 published authors from around the organisation, we seem to relish the chance to tell the stories of our work. And people seem to want to read them too – with around 10,000 visitors a month.\n\"Motor Manufacturing\" by Clive Gardiner for the Empire Marketing Board (ref CO 956/258)\nSo apart from that, why do we do it? For three reasons. First, The National Archives is doing some of the most interesting work around on a whole lot of issues. Our aim is to bring some of this to the people who matter – the users, readers and researchers. We certainly haven’t always been perfect but it is all the more important that we get feedback from users to make our services as good as they can be. Second, because of the financial situation, the best way to get this feedback is not through expensive surveys or focus groups, but through the web and social media. And, third, our role is to bring the most interesting public records and information to light, objectively, and let others discuss them. Continue reading »\nI was interested in some of the wider questions that were raised over the spring this year on the size and scale of the civil service. One of the straw-men that was set up was that the UK government, at the height of Empire, ran everything with 4,000 people, all of whom could be fitted neatly into Somerset House. With a little help from the team here (in particular Ed Hampshire), we thought it might be useful to assess this in some more detail.\nEmpire Marketing Board 1927 'Highways of Empire' (Catalogue ref. CO 956/537 A)\nStarting with civil servants in Whitehall, 4,000 is about right for the interwar period, but too high for the 19th century. The central government departments were all very small until the First World War. For example, the Foreign Office had around 100-175 staff (including doorkeepers, porters etc.) up to 1914. The Admiralty had around 70-80 well into the mid-19th century.[1*] Four government departments (Colonial Office, Foreign Office, Home Office, India Office) were all housed in the building that now only houses about a 1/3rd of the staff of today’s FCO (Charles Street).[2*]\nContinue reading »\nColossus electronic digital computer, 1943 (Catalogue ref: FO 850/234)\nI hope by now that you’re starting to get the idea that The National Archives is a bit of a dark horse when it comes to innovating in technology. We have, as far as I can tell, won more technology awards for more separate projects than anyone in the public sector except for the NHS, and we’re a little smaller. This culminated in a Queen’s Award for Enterprise and Innovation last year for our digital preservation technologies across all sectors and a public sector digital award for legislation.gov.uk. It doesn’t stop there – we also innovate in education, and the physical preservation of our collection, saving a lot of energy in the process.\nSo I thought it might be interesting to describe my view on our approach. I’ll look at technology, cost, and culture.\nI feel rather privileged to be the first person to use our new blog, where people from across The National Archives will post about their work. There’s a wide range of activity that we’re involved in, and I hope this blog will really convey this to everyone we work with.

{"text": "My manservant had, as usual, materialized just when I needed him. I swear he has a sixth sense.\nI put the newspaper down. \"Joe,\" I said, \"I am so mad at this character John LaBruzzo that I need the calming influence of one of your specials. Kindly mix me a stiff one.\"\nI expect you've heard about LaBruzzo. He's the state rep who wants to sterilize poor people and give the upper classes tax breaks for having children.\nFrankly, that strikes me as uncivilized. You know what would happen? The racial balance would be skewed, and society would become top heavy. Domestic servants, if we could find them at all, would want top dollar. It would be the biggest blow to gracious Southern living since the Civil War.\nI never miss a chance to discuss current events with Joe, but thought it best not to pursue this line of argument when he returned. It might sound selfish, or even bigoted. Joe's ancestors inhabited hotter climates than mine, so I always tread very carefully.\nI swished the ice cubes and took a stimulating draught. \"There's a word for this, Joe. I remember my dear old grandfather saying that humanity would benefit by applying the principles he learned breeding horses. He used to talk about some movement he was in years ago, but I'm damned if I can remember what it was called.\"\n\"Eugenics, sir. The theory was that unfit specimens should be prevented from procreating and contaminating human stock. Miscegenation was widely banned, imbeciles and epileptics hunted down to be forcibly sterilized, and immigrants from undesirable ethnic groups were turned back. Italians and Irish, I believe, were widely regarded as a dire threat to America's gene pool.\"\nJoe sometimes congratulates me on my sense of irony -- and I am pretty sure he is serious. This time it took me a minute or so to latch on, but I knew he would be impressed when I came through. \"LaBruzzo -- isn't that an Italian name?\"\n\"Indeed it is, sir, and in the old days Italians were greatly despised in New Orleans. But that was long before LaBruzzo's time, and nowadays Italian ancestry is no bar to social acceptance, except, perhaps, in certain krewes.\"\nDid I see a flicker of a smile on his face? I, of course, refused to be drawn. Beauregard will never be one to divulge the secrets of Carnival. I sent Joe off to replenish the goblet and picked up another newspaper, which included quotations from some Tulane egghead that left me mystified.\nWhen Joe returned, I was confident he could help me out. \"Joe, what is Jonathan Swift's Modest Proposal?\"\n\"Ah, yes sir. LaBruzzo has reminded many people of Swift's suggestion that the poor sell their infants to be eaten by the rich.\"\n\"That's his proposal, is it? Well, you can tell him from me that he is sick in the head.\"\n\"I fear that is not possible, sir. In any case, Swift was not serious. He was an Irish satirist.\"\nI gazed into the delicious concoction deep in thought. Then it struck me. \"Do you think that LaBruzzo might be an Italian satirist, Joe?\"\nYou will never catch Joe off guard, but the question did cause his eyebrows to rise by about a millimeter. He said something to the effect that LaBruzzo was not regarded as a subtle mind even in the state capitol. He was no more of a jokester than the old kleagle and Third Reich fan, David Duke, who called for the sterilization of welfare recipients when he represented the same district in the state House.\nJoe pointed out that welfare reform had made the rationale for such legislation even flimsier than in Duke's day. Duke got nowhere with his bill, and Joe reckoned that the Legislature would give LaBruzzo short shrift too, supposing he was reckless enough to introduce a bill and take on the Catholic lobby.\n\"I am with the archbishop on this one,\" I told Joe. \"I think it only right that the poor should always be with us. Still, let's give LaBruzzo credit for good intentions. He only wanted to remove a drain on the public purse, and sterilization would be strictly voluntary.\"\n\"That is true, sir, but compulsory sterilization is hardly an option as the law currently stands. And if we are to discourage breeding among people who damage the economy, we might start castrating Wall Street bankers.\"\nI thought he was joking, but when I checked my portfolio later that evening, I began to warm to the idea.\n. . . . . .\nJames Gill is a staff writer.

{"text": "If a visit to this weekend's (June 13) grand opening of the Audubon Insectarium inspires a sudden interest in entomology, continue your explorations with a do-it-yourself film festival.\nSadly, \"The Savage Bees,\" the 1976 television movie about killer bees disrupting Carnival before being air-conditioned to death in the Superdome on Ash Wednesday (\"the quietest day of the year in New Orleans\"), is not available on DVD.\nLuckily, there are plenty of other choices. Granted, there's more fiction than science about them, but here are five titles that deliver the bugs.\nA Bug's Life\nThe insectarium's colorful exhibits lead quite naturally to a repeat viewing of this computer-animated classic from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. The 1998 movie tells the story of a misfit ant who recruits a troupe of flea circus performers to help save his colony from some mean grasshoppers. The family-friendly film is known for its groundbreaking use of delicate lighting effects.\nThose who prefer old-school bug movies should check out this genre-defining, 1954 black-and-white classic, in which atomic tests in New Mexico turn ants into man-eating monsters. Promotional materials promised \"a horror horde of crawl-and-crush giants clawing out of the earth from mile-deep catacombs! . . . Kill one and two take its place!\"\nEight Legged Freaks\nMid-century horror cliches are played for camp value in this 2002 film with the hyphen-challenged title, which should be \"Eight-Legged Freaks.\" The movie isn't about eight freaks who happen to have legs; it's about a bunch of freaks with eight legs apiece. Yep, it's your basic giant spider movie, tricked out with the kind of visual effects filmmakers in the 1950s could only imagine. (If you prefer less cheese, check out 1990's \"Arachnophobia\" instead. In that film, the spiders don't have to be supersized to be superbad.)\nIt might be set in New York, but it's New Orleans' worst nightmare. Scientists engineer a \"Judas Breed\" -- half-mantis, half-termite (insert scream here) -- to wipe out plague-carrying cockroaches by impersonating them, infiltrating their nests and killing them. Unfortunately, the new bugs don't know when to stop -- and guess whom they're impersonating now! Mexico's Guillermo Del Toro directs the 1997 film. (If you prefer your cockroaches to have a sense of humor, check out \"Joe's Apartment\" from 1996 instead.)\nIn a future in which a fascist global government has founded military academies with co-ed showers, Earth must defend itself from a planet populated by giant bugs. When the film was released in 1997, director Paul Verhoeven (whose previous two films were \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Showgirls\") came under fire for his supposed glorification of fascist imagery, although a case can be made that that's just successful production design. At any rate, the viscerally thrilling action sequences helped the film build enough of a fan base to merit two direct-to-DVD sequels. \"Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation\" was released in 2004, and \"Starship Troopers 3: Marauder\" will arrive Aug. 5. There also was a British television series titled \"Roughnecks: The Starship Troopers Chronicles,\" available as a DVD series.\nALSO ARRIVING THIS WEEK\nRelease dates are subject to change.\n(N) denotes a Newhouse review.\n(TP) denotes movie critic Mike Scott's review.\nTuesday (June 17)\nBurn Notice: Season 1\nCalifornication: Season 1\nCarmen Miranda Collection\nDynasty: 3rd Season, Vol. 1\nER: 9th Season\nInspector Gadget: Big Little Problems\nJericho: 2nd Season\nJungle Book 2: Special Edition\nJust Add Water\nMeerkat Manor: Season 3\nMy Mom's New Boyfriend\nThe Naked Brothers Band: Polar Bears\nPopeye & Friends, Vol. 1\nPopeye the Sailor: 1938-1940, Vol. 2\nRails & Ties\nThe Real McCoys: Season 3\nSo I Married an Axe Murderer: Special Edition\nThe Suite Life of Zack & Cody: Lip Synchin' in the Rain\nThe Sword in the Stone: 45th Anniversary Edition\nUnder the Same Moon\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles\nTyler Perry's Meet the Browns\nSuperhero Movie: Extended Edition\nSpaced: Complete Series\nLost Boys: The Tribe", "id": "<urn:uuid:e7225454-ce91-4cc0-8be1-fa84370e7f97>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.nola.com/michaelkleinschrodt/2008/06/creepycrawlies_take_starring_r.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:23:18Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9232653379440308, "token_count": 972, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "September 25th, 2007 § § permalink\nIn this entry, I am actually going to try to be both serious and informative. Hard to believe….but here it is:\nIn the past couple of years I have been in a hell of a lot of pain from what has recently been diagnosed as Piriformis Syndrome. If it sounds radioactive, it is. Not in a U238 kind of way but it radiates like a bitch and if you have never experienced chronic pain, do I not recommend it, even to those amongst us who profess to enjoy it. If by some chance, nature did not endow you with an ounce of empathy, this here: tear jerking, fist clenching, teeth gnashing, and all consuming pain, will make you wish you never existed. And the best part of it is, it’s on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and every sorry ass day of the year.\nWhy am I telling you this? Fear not, I do not need your pity or sympathy, even-though I’ll take your money, but if by some stroke of fantastic luck, you are reading this, and are sitting at home and contemplating the old adage, that dropping like a stone has its advantages, read these here phrases before you decide to leap off the ledge and into the bottomless pit (btw, in you are going to do it anyway, remember that you must jump from at least the 4th floor, to ensure a sufficiently traumatic death? .\nAs I was saying, in October 2006, I decided that I had had enough of this grief to actually do something about it. I went to see a MDs, and as it turned out, not just one but many. At the time the pain was severe but not yet devilish. I had just finished crossing the country and the Pacific several hundred times, in a three month traveling frenzy, which had aggravated my aches and pains enough to warrant a trip to the clinic. I started to believe that since I was spending all this dough on health insurance, why not give medicine a spin, no more barin’ and grinnin’…. let’s get some relief, you’ve earned it….\nLong story short, the pain got worse and worse, the MDs got more and more confused as to why my supposed Sciatica had no visible diagnosis, no herniated disc or spinal stenosis. Hell, at this point, since we can’t figure this out lets shunt him off to the pain clinic; it’s what we do when our protocols are no longer useful and we’d rather not look into it, it’s probably all in his head anyway.\nBeing the type A that I am, and a strong believer in answers to everything, I simply refused to believe the way this was ultimately going. I decided to enroll my friend Scott, the MD, who one early summer day came bouncing out of the San Francisco mist to casually mention, that I ought to get Botox injections: ” I read a paper recently that Botox injections can be quite effective, if, as you seem to so vociferously believe, that it’s a muscular, not a skeletal thing”.\nA quick search (Botox + Siatica) on the internet and there it was, the number three, the trinity(actually six). There are, in turns out, not two but three possible diagnosis for this wretched sciatic misery; and here is my word for it: Piriformis Doloris Vendictis.\nI won’t describe it here, just go to these and the other links, I am so generously providing alongside this entry to remind you that medicine is protocol based; to believe in your instincts and listen to your pain, not the physicians who think they seen it all before; just another patient, like every other miserable wretched case before it.\nMy condition, it turns out, should have been well known to the MDs who treated me, it’s not that uncommon, but thanks to the time constrained and generally disinterested MDs who treated me, I was well on my way to rotting, alongside all the other unlucky corpses haunting the halls of the chronic pain.\nEpilogue: I received a Botox injection in the Piriformis last August fourth, and am doing better. Not out of the woods yet, as a lot of physical therapy and possibly many more corticosteroids and Botox injections will be needed to deliver me from this nightmarish affliction, but at least now, it has a name and can be treated like the bitch that it is.\nBelow, are must reads, if you have any kind of sciatic like nerve pain radiating down your lower limbs. Even if your MRI shows signs of herniation or synopsis, as it often will; do not discount the Piriformis, and mention it to your MD, as a very real possibility. Send him/her the links and nip it in the bud, before it breaks your spirit, as it eventually will as the longer a diagnosis takes, the greater your chances of going insane in the membrane.\nTake it from me, chronic pain is unmitigatedly the closest thing to absolute misery. If you have it, wether or not your Piriformis is the culprit, you have my deepest sympathies; I feel your pain, I really do mean it, even if I often profess to the contrary.\nSeptember 21st, 2007 § § permalink\nAs promised, I will now attempt to dissect the killer formula behind these starlets’ photographic replicas. The power, the éminence grise, behind these two pixies, I so generously posted in today’s and last Tuesday’s entries. BTW, I have no idea who Josie Maran is, but I am familiar with Jessica Alba and of the ongoing struggle for cultural hegemony, between hers truly, and Miss Jessica Biel. If I am not mistaken, these two young women are being currently toted as America’s hottest shakespians, or rather, “best in show”, in a supporting role as a bathing beauty.\nNotwithstanding this aside, and in order to properly complete this task, I undertook to partner with a literary companion to search the internet and settled with a symbols dictionary, so as to remain as objective and un-lascivious as might be expected of a male of this specie. One who could infuse this entry with credibility and referential certitude, as oppose to vaguely self referential ineptitude.\nWithout much thought or premeditation, I briefly transcribed into words what I was seeing on screen. Also, and as previously mentioned, least we forget; I stumbled upon these screen saving beauties, on the same website where as lady luck would have it, I also found a very atonal, Middle Eastern version of Nokia’s iconic ring tune. (Furthermore, and as you may already know, cell phone manufacturers are forced to devote a lot of their precious, and limited global resources, to transcribing their “flagship” ring tones into other languages, and craft multi-culturally appropriate Pavlovian melodies, to win, the hearts and minds of the masses).\nJosie Maran(Tuesday the 18th): Image includes three obvious and visible references.\nAs the orbit of Venus, is closer to the sun than is the earth’s, it is never seen more than 48 degrees from the sun. This means that Venus is visible as the Morning star or Evening star in the immediate vicinity of the Sun. Thus Venus can only be seen from earth just before sunrise in the morning or just after sunset in the evening. As you can see, the use of the sunset, as a background for the Josie Maran image, wether, conscious or unconscious can be easily associated with Venus, the goddess of beauty, love and fertility.\nRocky Seashore (Ocean scape included)*:\nAs for the rocky seashore behind her, I will have to subjectively interpret its meaning, as a quick search on the internet did not reveal any interesting references, or reasons why the creatives, behind this image, decided to incorporate it in the shot.\nBased on my knowledge of classical texts, and secure in the knowledge that water is supposed to represent nature’s passive element and is the ultimate solvent, I may be correct in presuming that the viewer is to feel non-threatened by this beauty but not so much so as to render her bland and unexciting.\nThe rocky shore line, is, I presume, meant to spice it up so to speak, infuse the scene with a bit of danger and mystery. Josie wants to be remembered as the girl next door, who might also, just as well spank you if you misbehave. She wants to pack enough of a punch so that you’ll keep a close but admiring distance. She’s just out of your reach, someone else’s treat. Unless, that is, you can in turn prove that, you are indeed equal to her needs. A task, not so easily achieved, as the competition for such a beauty is stiff. In order to join her archetype on these rocky shores, you will have to earn it, and prove to this Aphrodite, that you can swim.\nAnd what about that autograph, which also happens to be our third and final peek: After-all, she may seem unapproachable and beyond reach, but still, she is a human being and would not want you to think that she does not appreciate her legions of teenage fans. Think of it as a kiss on the cheek, a smile, a look back and a wink as she steps into the limousine.\nAs for Ms. Alba, I would venture to think that the image above is meant to have you believe that she’d be a better mother to your kids than Josie, who, if you’re not jealously careful, might run off with Neptune, when you’re not looking. Frankly who would blame her, have you seen how well hung Neptune is? and from the looks of you, all you’ve got going; besides that hair piece, is a few moles and that gun you’re holding.**\n* To separate these two, into distinct symbolic representations, seems at this point in time, inappropriate.\n**A Corsican Welcome.\nSeptember 19th, 2007 § § permalink\nI was able to find good text to voice software, and with a bit of work, I managed to find the very tone and voice, this blog is meant to emulate. I shall soon, be slowly transcribing, each and every entreaty. So, if you like reading these entries, please listen to them, it will add to the overall feeling. They are now, and will be, far more representative of my personality.\nSeptember 18th, 2007 § § permalink\nIt is my great pleasure to inform you that I will be transcribing all past and future blog entries into embedded audio files, available right here, on this blog. This thecnology will allow you to listen to my entreaties instead of having to actually read each and everyone of them. A voice generating robot will be performing this thankless and dreadful task, so that I, may not have to.\nA word of caution, you might have to listen very carefully. As of yet, I am unaware of any free, Mac compatible software out there, which might do a better job than Fred….Also known as the “Stephen Hawking”.\nSeptember 18th, 2007 § § permalink\nA quick note please: To experience this entry, as it was meant to be, it would be best to click the MP3 above. A pop up will appear, which you will need to forcibly shove aside, so as not to obscure your reading pleasure. Until such a time as I can figure out how to play it automatically, you will need to comply with this directive. Thank you, the management….\nOn a whim, I undertook to search for Arabic ring tones and in the process of expanding my search, as is so often the case, I quickly became mired in a tangled web of baroque web pages, MP3s, MIDIs, pop ups, Dubai mortgages and Arabian real estate.\nTo my here disbeliefs, the Muezzin’s MIDIs is, if well intoned, not a bad way to shake off some dream sleep and double check, how red delicious, Kabul’s sunsets might look to the Almighty™, after a long day. In the meantime, while browsing afore mentioned website I nearly picked up my pen to sign these dotted lines: “Allah is defined as the ONE who ALONE, without partners or helpers created all that IS created in creation, either known or unknown.” Sounds like an all rights grab to me; and because we should be so lucky, his excellency, rimes with intellectual property…… How’s about 72 attorneys…..?\nWhile desperately trying to extirpate myself from a dozen web pages, I inadvertently followed a link and came upon afore posted, Kafir beauties; which, to my manly delights, featured scantily clad celebrities. Cell phone mementoes, that to many a teenage dream screams: “Call me…!”. Afterall, it does not hurt to dream a little, every time you hear that ring tone and pick up the phone; like snacking between meals, sneaking a peek, or coping a flat screen, when no one’s looking….. If only that damn LCD didn’t fade to black, with such annoying regularity.\nAs an aside, later today, I shall also explore why we primates find such images so compelling, and how they are, ever so deftly constructed to lure so many fishes with nothing but a hook and no bait. Why is it that images of such enticing and classically trained young ladies, always seem to say: Why isn’t she calling.?\nSome day, I promess, I shall reveal, lay bare and peel back, the many layers of this cake. Trust me, nothing but good things awaits us in this future and upcoming journey.\nSeptember 13th, 2007 § § permalink\nThese are my great grand parents on my mother’s side. I shot this framed image in my ninety four year old grand mother’s bedroom last month, in Milaria, Corsica. I dropped by the village for a couple days to visit her and found this propped up, on her bedroom set. It was nice to see that even at 94, she gazes at their image every night, before she goes to bed and may be dreams of rejoining their warm embrace.\nI do not see any reason why I should not have 4×6 of my mother when I am her age but it was surprising to see this portrait come out of the woodwork, and remind me, that my grandmother’s memories go back so far in time, that they seem down right alien, ancient and distant to this grand child’s eyes. Time will render us all the same, and our descendants, our grand kids even, will look up some day and see us, not as we were but dead.\nI would not mind owning portraits of my ancestors circa 1334, but I fear that that time has come and gone without momentoes, pics or snap shots. How rude, how thoughtless, how very, how to say, Dark Ages….\nNevermind them, for if all goes well, my descendants will be able to gaze up, five centuries from today, type in a password, hack my DNA and bring my carcass back to life, and give me another shot, at living on this planet; or the next.\nSince I would not want to be a burden, I’d be willing to provide enough cash to actually live off the interest, even five hundred years from now. In the meantime, I might get there by investing my last dimes to cryogenetically store my seeds in geostationary orbit , which would, with any luck be launched back to earth at a prescribed time and date and reconstituted, for a small fee, by future scientists. If five centuries seem like a long time, a downright and boringly longtime, don’t worry, it shouldn’t feel any longer than a good night’s sleep. By the time you rejoin your descendants, even at 5% compounded, you might even be rich. Like Social Security, but without the bitterness of government pay day…..\nCome to think of it, this might make the makings of a trashy sci-fi; where only those with enough cash would be reconstituted to live and work another ten decades. The rest of us who could not or would not provide well enough for our futures would simply wither away and die alone, in orbiting planetary hospices, shot into intergalactic space, where may be some other race would find us and bring us back to life to work us to death as sex slaves, or digging amonium trenches, four million light years away.\nAnyway, the possibilities seem compoundingly and endlessly hopeless…… Or better yet buy some government CDs, have yourself cryogenetically preserved along side Mickey, and there you have it, when your future mother drops you from her vageen, you’ll be sitting pretty, richly compounded, on pile of money*. Grown up, eat candy, blow half your savings on Crystal, crack and hot babes, blow your brains out, repeat as needed. If all keep on going well, invest in the future once and you won’t have to ever do it again. What’s life without death, and death without compound interest.\n*$1000.00 at 5% For 500 years= $ 39,323,261,827,218.67\nSeptember 7th, 2007 § § permalink\nTwo things for Friday Sept Sixth:\nThing One: I just took a nap for no other reason that I had to drive to Berkeley to deliver some promos for bulk mailing. After that, I went for a walk through UC, the university. Like an old man on his afternoon walk, my hands behind my back, I reviewed the offerings laid out on small tables where students proposed to let others, not I, join various ethnicities, to presumably once again bond and share a common ancestry, find solace amid a sea of unfamiliar kissters and grins. As if that was a barrel of monkeys, or something.\nWhen I first moved to this country, when I was fourteen, it never failed, I had to be introduced to every French, Dick and Harry who happened to live within a 200 miles radius of me. Wether I like it or not I had to play the little diplomat, shake their sweaty paws and prove to the peanut gallery that indeed we were French, not some knock off, some cheap Chinese copy. That generally was achieved by muttering a few words, twirling our mustaches and cursing “Les Roast-Beef “.\nAs if sniffing a terrier’s crack somehow smelled better to another terrier than a pug’s posterior or a shepherd’s ass. So, as I was saying; I strolled by so many recruiting stations that I became frightened and had to turn back, retrace my steps, return to my car and begin the short ride home to Saint Francis; but not before noticing the Future Business Leaders’ hermit crab convention and the Future Accountants of America ‘s kissing station. Like a fucking Carny, but scary…. I quickened the pace and then down right ran as fast as my shackles would let me.\nThing two: When you are forty two, going on forty three, you’d better not succumb to the culinary temptations of Telegraph avenue, which as you might have presumed, and rightly so, are chuck full of tricks and treats for teens. I made the mistake of ordering a large frozen yogurt on this empty stomach. Large frozen treat came with a paddle, for scooping, and could barely be dragged, never-mind carried. It came oozing, out of the frozen yogurt machine, all 50 gallons of it and had to be consumed alone, with no other posse or company than my own.\nNeedless to say, on the bridge back to San Francisky, my lids were droopy and my killer driving instincts severely diminished. I hopped into bed, closed my eyes and threw off the main switch. When I woke up, I did not really wake, just dreamed that I was waking and cutting myself a piece of salami. As I was chewing I came to realize that there normally is, no cutting board or salami in my bedroom; let alone on my bed, at least not in the past several years of domesticity. I decided to double check that what I was tasting was real, not some fucking dream, that it was indeed a piece of dried and smoked meat I was indeed, masticating. That did it, and next thing I know, I am truly awake, with both my hands deep inside my mouth, searching for that salami treat I could have sworn I was chewing.\nThing Three: Look up, not at the night sky, just the top of this page and behold the galaxies. I love this image. Every point, every spec, a galaxy. I even tried to run the dust and scratch filter in Photoshop and momentarily cleaned a few billion errand stars, clusters and galaxies. But not to cause, any real, intergalactic damage, I, promptly, commanded Z, and reverted to saved, right away.\nSeptember 6th, 2007 § § permalink\nI was out of town from August 16 until September 2nd.

{"text": "Question from Jennifer\nJanuary 31, 2013 at 7:44am\nIf I owe court fees can state take the money out of my federal? They just started garnishing my paycheck??\nAnswer: Jennifer - Thank you for your question.\nThe following information comes from IRS Tax Topic 203, Refund Offsets. This tax topic is available at the IRS web site, www.irs.gov:\nThe Department of Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS), which issues IRS tax refunds, has been authorized by Congress to conduct the Treasury Offset Program. Through this program, your refund or overpayment may be reduced by FMS and offset to pay:\n- Past-due child support;\n- Federal agency non-tax debts;\n- State income tax obligations; or\n- Certain unemployment compensation debts owed to a state. (Generally these are debts for compensation that was paid due to fraud or for contributions due to a state fund that were not paid due to fraud).\nYou can contact the agency with which you have a debt, to determine if your debt was submitted for a tax refund offset. You may call FMS at the number below for an agency address and phone number. If your debt was submitted for offset, FMS will take as much of your refund as is needed to pay off the debt and send it to the agency you owe. Any portion of your refund remaining after offset will be issued in a check to you or direct deposited for you.\nFMS will send you a notice if an offset occurs. The notice will reflect the original refund amount, your offset amount, the agency receiving the payment, and the address and telephone number of the agency. FMS will notify the IRS of the amount taken from your refund. Contact the agency shown on the notice if you believe you do not owe the debt, or if you are disputing the amount taken from your refund. If a notice is not received, contact FMS at 800-304-3107 or TDD 866-297-0517. The available hours are Monday through Friday 7:30AM to 5:00PM CT. Contact the IRS only if your original refund amount shown on the FMS offset notice differs from the refund amount shown on your tax return.\nThe courts do not appear to be covered in theTreasury Offset Program, however, you should contact the court or agency to determine if such a request has been made.Need tax help?

{"text": "Corporate cash does funny things to people. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) got into office by pledging to fight “special interests,” but just a decade or so later, he’s running one of the biggest special interest shows in Washington. It’s easy to see the appeal. As the fancy funding backing the Tea Party demonstrates, big money buys big things—from elections to populist outrage.\nIn a piece for Mother Jones, Kate Sheppard details some of DeMint’s serious campaign finance flip-floppery. During his first bid for Congress in 1998, DeMint denounced the Political Action Committee (PAC) mechanism as a tool deployed by “special interests” that “corrupts” the electoral process. But today, DeMint is the single most important figure and fundraiser for Senate Tea Party races. He has endorsed and pledged millions of dollars to support fringe right-wingers Senate candidates Christine O’Donnell (Delaware) and Rand Paul (Kentucky). DeMint has funneled this money through his own Political Action Committee (PAC) known as the Senate Conservatives Fund. DeMint even pledged to “fight for reforms that allow only individual contributions to campaigns.”\nBut as I note in a blog for Campaign for America’s Future, DeMint isn’t the only power player pouring money into the Tea Party. DeMint’s 12 Tea Party Senate candidates have reaped over $4.6 million from Wall Street for this election—excluding Wall Street cash that has been funneled through DeMint’s PAC. So much for all that grassroots rage against bailed-out elites.\nThe Tea Party bubble\nAnd Wall Street’s new Tea Party investment might just be the next big economic bubble. Joshua Holland at AlterNet surveys the campaign contributions of America’s bailout barons. The 23 firms that received at least $1 billion in bailout money from taxpayers spent $1.4 million on campaign contributions—in September alone.\nAnd these are just campaign contributions, which are essentially unaffected by the high court’s ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The real corporate money is running through front-groups that run their own ads—not the official campaigns operated by political candidates. And these front-groups don’t have to disclose where their money comes from.\nWriting for Campus Progress, Simeon Tally highlights a frightening trend toward secrecy in U.S. elections, fueled by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. Back in 2004, 98 percent of outside groups disclosed who their donors were. Today, that number is just 32 percent. We’re not just fighting corporate money bombs, we’re fighting secret corporate money bombs.\nWho really has the advantage?\nWhile there’s been much debate over who really comes out on top thanks to the post-Citizens United rules, Jesse Zwick notes for The Washington Independent, these stories are only talking about direct campaign contributions. Some might argue that Democrats have an advantage in disclosed funding, but Republicans have a six-to-one advantage money flowing through outside groups.\nBut wait, there’s more!\n- Check out Matthew Reichbach and Trip Jennings’ reporting for The New Mexico Independent on the fact that all of this spending from outside groups usually means money from outside the states where candidates are running. Outside expenditures have swelled to $5 million in two New Mexico House races—both in relatively cheap media markets.\n- AlterNet has been running loads of stories on crooked corporate cash, covering everything from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s dirty dealings with AIG to the political spending habits of bailed-out banks. Joshua Holland rounds up eight of the articles here for AlterNet.\n- Comic artist Matt Bors makes light of America’s new “growth industries” at Campus Progress, pointing to makers of anonymous political attack ads.\nThis post features links to the best independent, progressive reporting about the mid-term elections and campaign financing by members of The Media Consortium.

{"text": "BSDTalk has an interview with Kris Moore that was recorded during BSDCan. Kris talks about the features going into PC-BSD 9.1. The interview is available in mp3 and ogg formats.\nKris has announced the availability of the next testing snapshot:\nThe 20120525 snapshot in the PC-BSD 9-STABLE branch has just been released for i386 and amd64 architectures.\nThis snapshot provides both users and developers a means to test out new features in the upcoming PC-BSD 9.1 release. This snapshot may contain buggy code and features, so users are encouraged to run it only on non-critical systems.\nChanges since the previous snapshot:\n- Based on FreeBSD 9-STABLE from 05-20-2012.\n- Add support to Warden for using ZFS snapshots on jails. Now you may create, remove, and rollback previous snapshots of a jail via the command-line and GUI.\n- New bottom panel and features in the AppCafe for installed applications.\n- Updated the pc-thinclient command. Now you can run this utility to convert your system into a PXE boot server. During the setup you will be prompted if you want to create a remote desktop, or remote install server.\n- Added numerous fixes for i18n in our graphical utilities.\n- Added some safety checks to ZFS installs.\n- New “About” GUI, displays information about system.\n- Added initial support for enabling 8021X authentication, still a work in progress.\n- Added LDAP/AD support to installed Samba packages.\n- Fixed a bug setting firewall rules to “block” causing an invalid configuration file to be created.\n- Fixes for rdesktop utility missing some libraries.\n- Include new Intel video driver by default again.\nHighlights for the upcoming 9.1:\n- New system installer is greatly simplified for desktop and server installs.\n- New PC-BSD Server installation option. Includes command-line utilities like pbi-manager, warden, metapkgmanager and more.\n- Support for ZFS mirror / raidz(1,2,3) during installation.\n- Support for SWAP on ZFS, allowing entire disk ZFS installation.\n- Support for setting additional ZFS data-set options, such as compression, noexec, etc.\n- Warden jail management integrated into system. Allows creating jails via GUI, adding packages and other administration.\n- First boot setup wizard allows OEM installs to be easily performed.\n- New Bluetooth pairing tray / GUI utilities.\n- New AppCafe improvements and preferences\n- Improvements to wifi utility.\n- Fixed bug causing untranslated strings to show up empty.\n- Numerous bug-fixes to PC-BSD related utilities.\n- Support for creating PXE boot server for remote desktop and installation.\nIf you wish to update from 9.0 to this snapshot you may do so by editing /usr/local/share/pcbsd/pc-updatemanager/conf/sysupdate.conf and changing the PATCHSET: variable to “pcbsdtest”. After changing this variable, run the updater utility to download a new update manager. Once this update manager is installed, the online update to the snapshot will appear.\nDVD & USB images are available via the PC-BSD mirrors. You may select the mirror and files from here.\nA number of people have asked if they can upgrade from 9.0-RELEASE to the latest snapshot. Yes you can, if you carefully follow these instructions:\nIMPORTANT: As with any pre-release, there can and will be bugs, so be sure to backup your data to a removable media or another system first.\nAs the superuser, grab and build the newest pc-updatemanager utility. This requires you to first install Development-Qt and Development-VCS packages from Control Panel -> System Manager -> System Packages -> Development.\n# svn co svn://svn.pcbsd.org/pcbsd/current/src-sh/pc-updatemanager\n# cd pc-updatemanager\n# make install\nNow edit /usr/local/share/pcbsd/pc-updatemanager/conf/sysupdate.conf:\nChange PATCHSET: from pcbsd to pcbsdtest\nNow you can scan for updates and you should see a system update to\n9-STABLE-20120505 available. Let the update download as normal, then reboot. The system will reboot twice to update the kernel / world / packages, then you’ll be updated to the newer snapshot.\nAs with any snapshot, please report bugs to the testing mailing list so that we can work on fixing them.\nKris has announced the availability of the next testing snapshot. If you are using Intel video or would like to upgrade from a previous snapshot, read the Errata section below.\nThe next snapshot in the PC-BSD 9-STABLE branch has just been released\nfor i386 and amd64 architectures. This snapshot provides both users and developers a means to test out new features in the upcoming PC-BSD 9.1 release. This snapshot may contain buggy code and features, so users are encouraged to run it only on non-critical systems.\nChanges since the previous Snapshot:\n* FreeBSD 9-STABLE from 05-01-2012\n* Xorg 7.5.2 / Xorg-server 1.10.6\n* Includes the GEM kernel support patches\n* Added fail2ban for SSH brute force blocking\n* Added ossec to base system\n* Added support for all i18n languages currently in Pootle\n* Fixed sorting of installed Applications in AppCafe\n* Fixed some bugs in server install causing CLI apps to fail\n* Fixed stamping boot on BootCamp partitions.\n* Enable starting Warden jails at system bootup\n* Enable booting installer on systems with < 512MB of RAM\n* Enabled splash screen support\n* Multiple bugfixes to included utilities / apps\nHighlights for the upcoming 9.1:\n* New system installer! Greatly simplified for desktop and server installs.\n* New “PC-BSD Server” installation option. Includes command-line\nutilities like pbi-manager, warden, metapkgmanager and more.\n* Support for ZFS mirror / raidz(1,2,3) during installation.\n* Support for SWAP on ZFS, allowing entire disk ZFS installation.\n* Support for setting additional ZFS data-set options, such as compression, noexec, etc.\n* Warden jail management integrated into system. Allows creating jails\nvia GUI, adding packages and other administration.\n* First boot setup wizard allows OEM installs to be easily performed.\n* New Bluetooth paring tray / GUI utilities.\n* New AppCafe improvements and preferences\n* Improvements to wifi utility\n* Fixed bug causing untranslated strings to show up empty.\n* Numerous bug-fixes to PC-BSD related utilities\n* And much more!\n* Due to some port changes the updated Xorg Intel driver did not get\nautomatically included. You add it post-install by adding the line\n“WITH_NEW_XORG=yes” to /etc/make.conf and then building the\n/usr/ports/x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel port. This will be corrected in the next snapshot.\n* It is possible to update from the previous snapshot to the current version, however you will manually need to update the\n/usr/local/bin/pc-updatemanager command first.\nhttp://trac.pcbsd.org/export/16662/pcbsd/current/src-sh/pc-updatemanager/pc-updatemanager -o /usr/local/bin/pc-updatemanager\n# chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pc-updatemanager\nYou may now update via the system updater GUI.\nThe May issue of BSDMag (available for free download here) has two articles about PC-BSD.\nKris Moore has an article “A Fresh Look for the Warden for PC-BSD 9.1″ on pp. 6-9. Warden is a GUI tool for managing FreeBSD jails and has been rewritten for 9.1. New features include the ability to add multiple jails, the ability to create FreeBSD jails or ports jails (which use nullfs to allow you to safely install and run apps on your PC-BSD system), and the ability to export and import jails.\nJesse Smith has an article “Introducing EasyPBI–Making PBI Modules With a Few Mouse Clicks” on pp. 18-19. EasyPBI allows one to convert an existing FreeBSD port into a PC-BSD PBI with an easy-to-use GUI.\nKris sent the following update to the translations mailing list regarding menu localizations:\nI wanted to give you a quick status update on some of the changes for Translations in the 9-STABLE snapshots, and eventually PC-BSD 9.1.\nFirst, all languages which are available in Pootle will now be selectable for installation. Should a string not be fully translated, the default English string will be displayed instead. This will allow you to begin testing any/all languages in the upcoming snapshots.\nSecond, I have removed the “pbimeta.po” file from the translation process. This file had been getting so large, that it was becoming quite unreasonable to expect our translators to tackle it. This means in Pootle now you will see a more accurate representation of the translations progress. I’m currently investigating alternative methods of translating the AppCafe application descriptions.\nThird and lastly, I’ve implemented some cleanup functionality into the scripts which sync the strings into Pootle. As a string is modified or removed from our subversion tree, the old string will now be automatically purged from the Pootle database, keeping the number of strings for translation at a manageable amount.\nThanks for all the work you’ve done to translate PC-BSD into other languages!

{"text": "St. Patrick’s Day will be twice as crazy this year due to the holiday landing on a Saturday as well as the parade date scheduled for the following Saturday, March 24.\n“Molly Brannigans is the best place downtown to get a taste of an Irish celebration. We have an enormous amount of decorations up right now and there will be prizes, Irish dancers, bagpipers, DJ and $4 shots of Tullamoure Dew and Jameson Irish whiskeys,” manager Justin Boltz said. If the weather co-operates, the doors to the sidewalk will open out as well.\nA customary “kegs and eggs” all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet ($10) will greet early risers. The spread will incorporate rashers: extra lean, meaty cuts of back bacon (also known as Canadian bacon with its hamlike texture), eggs, hash browns and more.\nDue to the volume expected, lunch and dinner menu items will be pared considerably for the kitchen to deliver food swiftly. All of the Irish listings will be offered as well as a couple of the burgers, some of the wraps and sandwiches and all of the appetizers.\nOn a recent visit, we followed the L-shaped bar counter around from Second Street to Walnut Street passing two dark lit dining rooms, one with a couch and armchairs in front of a fireplace to the last room anchored by heavy wooden furnishings imported from Ireland.\nThe restaurant is much bigger than it looks from the outside. Dark woods, velvetlike seat cushions, Kelly green walls and large mirrors are consistent with the Irish pub theme. The floor was particularly sticky in this backroom as rubber soles latched on to drink spills with every step.\nHearty, Irish-influenced appetizers pair well next to well-poured pints of Guinness and Guinness drink combinations. Part Guinness, part Shock Top equals Dark side of the moon. Guinness and Boddingtons is called a dirty ol’ Englishman and Guinness and Smithwick’s is a black smith.\nThe Celtic basket, $12, contained a choice of three appetizers. We picked blarney stones. They are breaded, deep-fried rounds filled with corned beef, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese with Thousand Island dipping sauce. These little bites were quite flavorful flecked with just a bit of crunch from sauerkraut.\nCeili chicken are basically, deep-fried chicken tenders with meaty interiors and thick, crunchy outer crust and finally, potato sticks, which are deep-fried mashed potato-tasting batons with subtle hints of onion, but I couldn’t taste any bacon bits.\nTraditional leek and potato soup, cup, $3.25, was filling and substantial. Pale green in appearance, the potato-thickened potage had delicate onion flavor. Bacon bits and cheddar cheese garnished the surface and gave the soup a boost of additional richness.\nAs the meal continued, so did our thirst. In particular, shepherd’s pie, $12, was a well-concocted rendition of this classic Irish dish. Under mashed redskin potato and melted cheddar cheese lid, the filling was rich and dense with ground beef, peas and tender carrot pieces.\nIt was a good balance of ingredients, but the filling was overly salty. The Irish soda roll was dry-crumbed and tasted like a mouthful of baking soda.\nBoxty are traditional Irish potato pancakes wrapped around meat and or vegetable fillings. Corned beef boxty, $15, is the favorite choice of boxty at Molly Brannigans.\nThe huge pancake was more pancake mix and less shredded potato, but at the center was a delicious combination of sauteed, buttery, bites of cabbage and thinly sliced, nonsalty ripples of corned beef. A drizzle of grainy mustard and honey sauce was the perfect match for underlying meat and cabbage.\nPortions were huge and filling, but we slipped remaining entrees into containers and shared slices of rather bland tasting Boston cream pie and light and appetizing apple crumb tart.\nMolly Brannigans won’t accept reservations on these festive Saturdays so come early and stay late for seats.\nIrish Pub and Restaurant\n31 N.

{"text": "It all might start to change this week.\nToday and tomorrow are the days that marriage equality supporters have been waiting for, when the Supreme Court takes on the issue in two separate cases.\nOn Tuesday, the court will hear one hour of testimony on California’s Proposition 8 case, formally known as Hollingsworth vs Perry. On Wednesday, the justices will devote 110 minutes to hear arguments on the so-called federal Defense of Marriage Act, United States vs. Windsor.\nLGBT rights supporters and detractors were lining up as early as last Thursday to be in the courtroom for the arguments.\nWe wondered what specific issues the justices would be looking at in the two cases, and what possible outcomes the justices may decide.\nLet’s take Prop 8 first\nAccording to Geoffrey Stone, an expert on constitutional law and former dean at the University of Chicago Law School, the court will likely make one of four decisions in hearing Prop 8 on Tuesday:\n1) Not hear the case\n2) Agree with the opinion of Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the Ninth Circuit, which would limit the decision only to California\n3) Rule Prop 8 unconstitutional, but only in states where marriage is currently legal and states that already give LGBT people some protections – like civil unions or domestic partnerships\n4) Rule Prop 8 unconstitutional in total – meaning LGBT people have a right to marry everywhere U.S. law is applicable\nStone thinks the last scenario is unlikely, given the makeup of the court and recent suggestions by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that the Supreme Court may have “moved too far too fast” in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade case, thus giving rise to the bitter divide over abortion that still rages 40 years later.\nThe second option – agreeing with the lower court’s decision – would slow down the process, by ruling Prop 8 unconstitutional only on the grounds that when a state has already legalized marriage equality, it can’t take that right away. That is the ruling the Ninth Circuit made in February of 2012 in deciding the Prop 8 case. Judge Reinhardt specifically declined to consider whether same-sex marriage is constitutional, ruling narrowly on the ability of states to take away rights it has already granted. Since California is the only state in the country that has granted LGBT couples the right to marry, then taken that right away, California only would be affected by this decision.\nThe second option is also more in line with a decision Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in1996 striking down Colorado’s Amendment 2, which the court said discriminated against LGBT people and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause.\nThe third option, Stone thinks, is the most likely – that states that recognize same-sex couples on some level have to recognize marriage. Some legal watchers have dubbed this the “eight state solution,” in that it would automatically legalize same-sex marriage in eight states – Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Delaware and Hawaii – but it wouldn’t hold marriage legal in states such as Mississippi or Utah, which have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage.\nIt will now also include Colorado, which passed a civil unions law this past Thursday. Stone said that the decision to grant LGBT couples some rights in Colorado will, if the third option is adopted, trump the constitutional amendment banning marriage equality the state passed in 2006.\nSo, if the third option prevails, and the Court rules Prop 8 unconstitutional, but only applies it to states that have marriage laws already or states that have some same-sex couple protection, that will be 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, where same-sex couples can get married.\nThis is exactly the outcome that the Obama administration has argued for the in its amicus brief to the court.\n“It’s an intermediate step for the courts to eventually invalidate the laws against same-sex marriage,” Stone said. “The Justices might want to go slow – even though the majority of people favor same-sex marriage, there are states in the union which would consider it an outrage.”\nOf course, the court may simply decide that there is no case to be made. In both Prop 8 and DOMA, Stone pointed out, “the State of California and the Justice Department have been clear that they think those laws are unconstitutional.” That means that a government entity is not arguing against the issue at hand. In the case of Prop 8, California is not defending the state law. The justices may decide that since a government is not arguing for its own law, then the Court will not hear the case.\nMarriage equality advocates don’t want that scenario, as it would allow the Ninth Circuit decision to stand – which only rules that LGBT people can get married in California.\nNow let’s look at DOMA\nThe Justices will also decide if those that are arguing for the so-called Defense of Marriage Act have legal standing to do so, given that the Obama administration is not defending the law.\nYou’ll get up-to-date information on both cases here on the blog, and up-to-the-moment updates by Liking us on Facebook and Following us on Twitter!\nTwo lowercourts last year ruled DOMA unconstitutional, so if the justices don’t hear the case, those rulings will stand and the federal government will give the same benefits to same-sex married couples as it currently does to opposite sex married couples.\nThere’s also the possibility that the Court will rule that DOMA is constitutional.\n“I think that’s highly unlikely,” said Stone. “I don’t think there’s any scenario in which Anthony Kennedy would do that.”\nStone believes that Kennedy wants to write these opinions affirming some constitutionality of marriage equality. And he believes that Kennedy wants to write the next opinion – in a few years – legalizing same-sex marriage for all states.\nDOMA, he thinks, will be struck down, both because “Kennedy will be skeptical of denial of same-sex marriage” and because of the issue of whether the Federal government has any business telling people who they can marry. That, Stone asserted, could possibly be the issue that draws Chief Justice John Roberts to vote for striking DOMA down as well.\nIf DOMA is struck down, it will mean that LGBT couples will be afforded the approximately 1,100 federal benefits that opposite sex couples already get. It will not mean that states that don’t honor marriage equality will have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That’s an issue pertaining to the Full Faith and Credit clause of the constitution, which deals with contract law.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7ea7fe6c-80ed-4d63-90c5-c3dba1ed6ad4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.pflag.org/2013_03_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:22Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9551675915718079, "token_count": 1388, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "A beautiful combination of nature, origami and robotics\nMatthew has a thing for origami. In his own time, he tours the globe as an origami evangelist… helping to coax paper folding fanatics out of their shells to share some of the brilliance that we know and love from this distinctive artform.\nA recent residency at Ars Electronica FutureLab in Austria enabled Matthew to explore a combination of 3d printing and polyester fabrics to create these stunning networked robots. They not only respond to each other, but also to the proximity of any fleshy humans who happen to be nearby. An ultrasonic sensor at the centre of each Oribot responds to a nearby figure by gently opening the folds and changing colours.\nHaving 3d printers on site meant that Matthew could revise the mechanism for his design and then replicate it once the desired outcome had been reached.\nWatch the following video for a run-through of the Futurelab exhibition.\nThere’s also another clip from Oribotics on Vimeo\nUnder Matthew’s careful guidance, the Oribotics continue to evolve. I recently caught up with Matthew and his Oribot swarm at the Linden gallery in StKilda, where the installation will be on display until December 12.\nThey are not able to reconfigure themselves, or reproduce, or have any effect on the world other than being beautiful.

{"text": "I was reminded that I hadn't posted a blog entry recently and wanted to remedy the situation. When presented with my lack of posting, my first response was that \"I had lacked time\" recently due to client work. I was then reminded that despite our staff being 100% billable, we still expected them to blog.\nThat got me thinking - was it really time? The answer is \"no\". We can always find the time. What the real root causes are that can impact regular blogging are:\n- work that saps creativity in other areas of thinking\n- distractions in our day that break an innovation cycle\n- too much tactical activity and not enough strategic activity\nThese three elements are killers for innovation inside organizations. Blogging requires us to be innovative, if we are using the tool as more than just \"reporting the news\". In order to be able to come up with good, insightful blogs, your mental state and working environment needs to enable that.\nIf you look back, for instance, I was able to produce a number of good blog posts during the lead-up to MicroStrategy and throughout the conference and then post conference. Why? Was it having more time? Not really. I was on an interesting client engagement and the exciting stuff coming out of the BI space was thought-provoking, hence good blog posts. As I shifted into more routine consulting work for another client after that, the creative-well dried up. Hence, no blogging, here at the PXLTD blog or my own personal blog.\nSo how do we strike a balance? If I want to encourage my staff to blog, I need to give them the right ingredients, which include inspiration, interesting client opportunities and less distractions. With those key ingredients, people will find the time, no matter how busy they are, myself included. Being able to intersperse those ingredients amongst our client work (which sometimes is routine and not overly creative) is important.\nGoing forward, I'm going to put a standing task in my calender...not to blog - you can't force that process. Rather, I will add a task to look for and forward on items of interest and to seek out interesting opportunities that will spark creativity for myself and my staff. That in turn, should spark some interesting blogging ideas even when we find ourselves in the midst of normal client work.", "id": "<urn:uuid:868527c5-af62-46c5-b1a0-ae863e3122c0>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.pxltd.ca/weblogs/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:49:20Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9696896076202393, "token_count": 479, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Now that school is out for summer, families are about to cram into cars together on their way to the beach, the Grand Canyon, or that shining metropolis in the travel guide Mom bought six months ago. The family road trip is a rite of passage akin to the hero’s journey into the underworld, where untold horrors must be faced and tribulations overcome before reaching the desired destination. Games of “slug-bug” become full-on fist fights, riotous filibustering occurs with each change of the radio station, and every three minutes the tormented scream of “Will you stop touching me?” reverberates through a vehicle that, no matter its actual size, will always be too small. It’s enough to make you turn that car around and call the whole thing off, and just like your parents before you, you will issue that threat word for word. Or, you could just stock up on a few essential supplies to make the long trip as pleasant as possible. Here are a few tips to help your family reach its vacation destination on time and with minimal psychological trauma.\nGet a Plan in Place\nThe first real challenge of a road trip is getting from point A to point B. You’re going to need a strategy to get everyone there in one piece in time for the hotel checkin. First, it’s already going to be a long trip, so don’t complicate things by improvising a shortcut. The Garmin nuvi 50 5” GPS Receiver will show you the fastest route to your destination, and if you decide to go off the beaten path, it will recalculate your route and get you back to civilization.\nIt’s also a good idea to hook up a Cobra ESD9270 9-Band Radar/Laser Detector so you can watch your speed. We all go a little over the speed limit sometimes, but knowing you’re being clocked will remind you to take your time and drive safely.\nFinally, Waze is a handy app for Android and iOS that combines GPS and social elements to connect you to other drivers. Users keep each other updated about traffic jams, changing road conditions and speed traps, making Waze a real-time navigation tool that gets you where you need to be faster and with fewer headaches. There are even a few fun geo-gaming elements like leveling up after you’ve driven a certain number of miles.\nKeep the Troops Entertained\nOnce your plan’s in place and you’re on the road, the next trial you’ll have to face is keeping everyone in the car entertained. Enter the iPod touch. You’ll get valuable hours of peace and quiet from the family if they all have their own music to listen to, games to play and videos to watch. A good game of “Angry Birds” will help everyone take out the frustrations of a confining car ride on the evil pigs instead of each other.\nWhen the batteries start running low, charge them up with an Enercell 12VDC 3-Outlet Vehicle Power Adapter and a few Enercell Tablet and Smartphone Chargers. The 3-Outlet adapter will ensure that everyone’s device chargers are accommodated, even if you only have one vehicle outlet. If having three outlets still isn’t enough, go wireless and tap into some solar power with the Solio Bolt Solar Charger. With this many charging options, everyone will be up and running again in no time.\nWhile the iPods are charging, the family is going to have to compromise on what to listen to. You can find something for everyone with 130+ unique XM Satellite Radio stations and the SiriusXM Skydock. The Skydock lets you listen to XM over your iPhone or iPod, and the FM transmitter beams the music through your vehicle’s standard stereo. It also charges your device while you listen. Bonus.\nWith any luck, the radio will buy you enough time for the iPods to charge. Now you can play some classic car games with modern technology. Try “License Plate Travel Game” from iTunes and see who can spot the most out-of-state plates over the course of the trip. If your family uses Android devices, Marathon Travel Games has the license plate game as well, but also includes “Car Bingo”, a staple of the road trip.\nMake Graceful Exits\nOne final thing to help you have a smooth road trip: when you have to stop, stop strategically with these great apps:\nGas Buddy—When it’s time to fill ‘er up, stopping at the right gas station can save you some cash. Gas Buddy tracks prices at all the stations near you so you’ll never overpay for petrol.\nSitOrSquat Bathroom finder—There’s nothing worse than making a pit stop at a grimy, frightening truck stop that looks like it’s never been cleaned. SitOrSquat’s user-generated reviews will guide you to the cleanest bathrooms on the road.\niExit Interstate Exit Guide—What do you do when one kid will only eat chicken nuggets from Wendy’s and the other only from McDonald’s? Well, you need to find a highway exit with BOTH fast food joints or risk a pouty child upsetting the delicate tranquility in the car. iExit tells you everything located at each major highway exit, so if you combine its powers with the other two apps, you can make just one successful pit stop exit and get the family back on the road in no time.\nWith a little luck and planning, the family will emerge from the car, stretch their legs and still be able to tolerate each other for the next few days of sightseeing, rest and relaxation. Have any other great road trip tips or want to share where your family’s going this summer?

A firewall monitors your Internet connections and allows you to specify which programs are allowed to connect and which are not.\n4 antivirus software\nAntivirus software is a kind of computer program which can be used to test, defend, and take actions to remove or delete malicious software program. As we all know, computer virus is some programs, which can specially disturb computer operation. So we should update antivirus software in regular time to prevent against the latest virus.\n5 Windows password\nBesides the above mentioned software, you could have an alternative at the same time, namely Windows password. With a password like this, you can prevent your privacy from being let out or being viewed. Of course you should set up a Windows password reset disk to set the password reset in case that you forget it.\nAs a computer user, you should have a general knowledge of these safety terms so that you can protect your computer better. And with these terms, your computer can be protected better than that without them. In a word, please have a brief understanding of them in the first place, and then you could know how important they are.", "id": "<urn:uuid:3d310cea-07c0-49a6-a372-5da020bfac96>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.resetwindowspassword.com/tag/antivirus", "date": "2013-05-18T05:25:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9521350860595703, "token_count": 607, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Competitions, contests and giveaways are a great way to increase your fans, increase awareness of your page and retain their interest and keep them engaged. Last week Facebook made some quite significant changes to the Facebook Promotion Guidelines (Updated: May 11th) affecting those who own and run promotions on Facebook Pages.\nFacebook have also removed some specific rules with regards to running promotions to minors (13 – 17yrs). They have also provided more opportunities for previously prohibited categories: i.e. stated that there is no longer prohibition on certain types of promotions such as alcohol, diary, gambling.\nView more information here over at Inside Facebook: http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/05/17/age-residency-industry-restrictions-promotions/\nWe believe the reason why they are being quite significant with their changes, is their personal quest (and it makes sense) to remove themselves as middle-men between marketers and the varying laws throughout the world. We share our thoughts on the changes surrounding Facebook Promotions below: looking at what we now can’t do, can do and how to roll with the changes.\nPromotions on Facebook\nThe main point to shout about is that Facebook no longer want you to use their mechanics i.e. like a page, like a post, send a snap as a way of entering a contest.\nHowever section 4 in the guidelines is quite interesting, as it points out that “A like” must not be a condition of entry. Which means you could encourage “a like” to go and find out about the competition. Example: you could run the competition on your own website and give instructions on how to enter on your Facebook page. Hide the competition details on Facebook to “Fans only”. This will encourage people to like your page and will not be in breach of the guidelines.\nView the Promotion Guidelines here: http://www.facebook.com/promotions_guidelines.php (Date of last review: May 11, 2011)\nThe new guidelines make sense\nThe new Facebook guidelines do make perfect sense. It takes all the competition queries, complaints etc away from them and passes these back to the brand.\nScenario: Imagine if you really wanted to enter “that competition” to “Win Tickets to see Take That backstage”, you had to send in a story to say “Why you should win”. You spent “1 week working on it” and when you went to upload the entry, “Facebook went down”. You would shout at Facebook wouldn’t you rather than Take That!\nSo Facebook have released these new easy to read guidelines to basically say: My words:\n“You can run the competitions and contests but make sure it is clear that they are nothing to do with us, as we can't handle the grief. Thanks”.\nThe Future for Facebook promotions\nYou can keep up to date with the latest happenings, guidelines by following: http://www.facebook.com/FacebookPages. We also like to follow:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/marketing for marketing solutions and inspirational ideas from other brands.\nFacebook has included a very clear definition of what constitutes a promotion: “a contest, competition, sweepstakes or other similar offering,” where “by ‘contest’ or ‘competition’ (Facebook means) a promotion that includes a prize of monetary value and a winner determined on the basis of skill (i.e., through judging based on specific criteria)” and “by ‘sweepstakes’ (Facebook means) a promotion that includes a prize of monetary value and a winner selected on the basis of chance.”\nBy no means is this is not the end of Facebook Promotions, they are simply inviting you to be more creative in your use of external applications and linking into your fans that like to live on Facebook.\nDon’t abuse the Facebook mechanics\nThe new promotion guidelines clearly state that you must not use the Facebook mechanics as part of a contest.\nThis involves mechanics of any fan, uploading, commenting, or liking a page that will be judged.\nSection 4: of the promotions guidelines does however encourage interaction on Facebook and indicates that actual entry has to be through an external application. View the snippet from section 4 below:\nSection 4: “You must not condition registration or entry upon the user taking any action using any Facebook features or functionality other than liking a Page, checking in to a Place, or connecting to your app. For example, you must not condition registration or entry upon the user liking a Wall post, or commenting or uploading a photo on a Wall.”\nFacebook Promotion Guidelines, May 2011.\nSo as you 'must not condition registration', this means you can use Facebook Updates to say\n“Come and enter our competition here” and off your site you can tell people to join your Facebook Page for exclusive offers from your company as long as the next step is click here to enter the competition.\nA few scenario examples of what you can no longer do on Facebook\n1. Father's Day promotion: Upload a photo of your Dad and tell us why he is COOL!! for him to Win XY.\n2. Share your snap: Please like the snap you want to win.\n3. Comment on our update and tell us “why you love us” and you could win XXX.\n4. Like us and in XX months, we will choose a random winner of YYYY.\nUse of External Applications\nThe promotion guidelines state that “all promotions” on Facebook need to be run within an App that you or your digital agency have created (you keep the email addresses) or on a 3rd Party Application (such as Wildfire, Involver).\nPlease note that most third party apps will charge you and they often receive the email addresses, not you, so there are clear benefits of creating your own App or Canvas Page.\nFind out more about Apps on Facebook here or contact us.\nBe the owner of the competition\nThe new guidelines strongly indicate that you need to make sure you don’t make it look that Facebook are affiliated with your company / competition, via text and images and logos at the competition landing page and also be clear in the terms and conditions that Facebook is simply a channel.\nRemember also re: the 'can't dos', that you are NOW not allowed to contact the WINNER on Facebook, this includes via messages, chat and wall posts. You will need to receive their email address and contact the winners off Facebook. Once you have notified them via an off Facebook channel, then you can post congratulations on your wall and thank others for entering.\nHow to roll with it\n1. Design an App which integrates with your website competition module and Facebook or design an iFrame page and have an email opt in for the competition, or create the email opt in on your site and direct Facebook users there. We saw a great example of a competition Facebook App over at the Science Museum Facebook Page, see the image below, which shows email opt in and link to the terms and conditions.\n2. Make sure you list in your Terms and Conditions that this competitions is nothing to do with Facebook\n“I give permission for (name of company) to contact me using the entered details provided if I am the successful recipient of the prize. I acknowledge the promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with, Facebook. I understand I am providing information to (name of company) and not to Facebook\"\n3. Notify the winner via email. Once the winner has received notification they you can broadcast their name on the FB page.\n“We recently connected XX to let them know that they are the winner of YY...congratulations”\nWe have a new mantra in the Flashlight Search Marketing office: \"when designing social media contests always consider not just the creators but the spectators and the voters too. Create a tick list on contest mechanics, web development and off site integration\" This mantra especially rings true with the new FB promotion guidelines.\nIf you need assistance in running a competition or setting up an onsite competition module to integrate with Facebook, an iFrame app or opt-in form on your website then please give the Rocktime Sales team a call, so that they can organise this for you.\nAuthor: Sarah Griffiths", "id": "<urn:uuid:811b26eb-3a49-482c-9bee-9ea64804ced5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.rocktime.co.uk/2011/05/updated-facebook-promotion-guidelines.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:55Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9415676593780518, "token_count": 1750, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational;Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

They were the babies who bounced on their grandparents laps. Their grandparents were the babies of former slaves. Perhaps, after slavery, people should have been content with just living. Maybe the next generation should have been fine with living within a “separate but equal” culture of hate. I suppose my generation should be happy to pretend Affirmative Action isn’t needed, and the reality of living in at least the middle class is fading into a dream of the past.

{"text": "Ever wondered what white tea is? Why we call it white anyway? Here are a few interesting facts about white tea, made from the plant Camellia sinensis:\n- White tea is similar to green tea in that it has undergone little processing and no fermentation whatsoever.\n- The leaves are harvested before they open fully, when the unopened buds are still covered by thin silvery white hair. Hence the white tea name.\n- White tea has a subtle and slightly sweet flavor that sharpens the senses without overwhelming the tongue, whereas green tea has a “grassy” taste.\n- There is 25% to 30% less caffeine in white tea than in green tea, though it depends on the variety.\n- White tea health benefits are the highest among the tea family¹.\n- It is more expensive than green or black tea because white tea is scarcer. Yet, at Savorique, white tea is as cheap as black or green tea.\nNote 1: Science Daily “”White Tea Could Keep You Healthy and Looking Young”\", (August 14, 2009) and Science Daily “”White Tea Beats Green Tea In Fighting Germs”\", (May 28, 2004).", "id": "<urn:uuid:6d64f04d-9635-43ad-b483-874653a0280b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.savorique.com/tag/white-tea-health-benefits/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:08:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9220250248908997, "token_count": 252, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "In Scouting, knives are a double-edged sword.\nUsed safely, they’re part of a rite of passage for boys and a chance for leaders to impart important lessons to help Scouts become “Prepared. For Life.”\nBut inevitably, some Scout will do his best Crocodile Dundee impression and show up at summer camp with the 10-inch sheath knife his uncle bought him.\nThe BSA keeps its knife policy intentionally vague (see below), offering suggestions but leaving specific policies up to individual units.\nDoes your pack, troop, team, or crew have a policy?\nUnits with knife policies often set a specific maximum blade length and other restrictions. Others leave it up to their Scouts’ common sense and only intervene if the need arises — such as confiscating a Scout’s big sheath knife or butterfly-style knife and returning it to his parents after the trip.\nWhether you have a policy or are considering creating one, first read what the Guide to Safe Scouting says:\nA sharp pocketknife with a can opener on it is an invaluable backcountry tool. Keep it clean, sharp, and handy. Avoid large sheath knives. They are heavy and awkward to carry, and unnecessary for most camp chores except for cleaning fish. Since its inception, Boy Scouting has relied heavily on an outdoor program to achieve its objectives.\nThis program meets more of the purposes of Scouting than any other single feature. We believe we have a duty to instill in our members, youth and adult, the knowledge of how to use, handle, and store legally owned knives with the highest concern for safety and responsibility.\nRemember—knives are not allowed on school premises, nor can they be taken aboard commercial aircraft.\nThe Guide to Safe Scouting doesn’t get more specific than that, but most states do. Some states restrict knife length — in Texas, for example, a knife with a blade longer than 5.5 inches is deemed “illegal.” Others forbid certain kinds of knives, such as throwing knives.\nThis site aggregates state knife laws, so check your state’s laws today and be in the know.\nHow to create a policy\nIn keeping with the youth-led spirit of Boy Scout troops, Venturing crews, and Varsity teams, you’re better off letting the Scouts set their own policy.\nInvolving them in the process ensures that they’ll take ownership in the policy and will more effectively follow and enforce it.\nSuggest they address knife length, kinds of knives allowed, how many knives each Scout can bring, proper storage, Totin’ Chip requirements, and anything else that addresses specific needs in your unit. And don’t forget to print out your state’s knife laws and give that to your youth leaders to consult.\nPretty soon, you’ll have a policy that allows — encourages, even — the safe use of knives in Scouting.\nTake the poll\nNeed your own knife? Win one!\nSpeaking of knives, don’t forget to enter the CUT ABOVE GIVEAWAY for a chance to take home one of six great knives. Contest ends Aug. 31, 2012.\nWhat do you think?\nI’d love to know whether packs, troops, teams, and crews have specific knife policies. If so, what do they include? Do you specify a maximum blade length? What about quantity — can Scouts carry multiple knives?

{"text": "We’re rebuilding ScraperWiki.\nFor three years, we’ve been helping people get, clean and analyse data on the web. Our key insight was that you need to write code to do that, and we should make writing that code as easy as possible.\nEarlier this year, we realised that that isn’t enough.\nScraperWiki Classic, as we now call the original ScraperWiki, falls into a gap. It’s neither flexible enough for most programmers, nor simple enough for most non-programmers.\nThere’s a bunch of people who love it, right in the middle. Our plan was to push that sideways – add more features to make it useful to programmers, and add tools to make it useful to anyone.\nWe listened and watched our users and found it wasn’t going to work. To make ScraperWiki useful to enough people now, we have to make it powerful and geeky enough for programmers, and, right at the other end, supply code-free tools that anyone can use straight away.\nSo that’s what we’re making. One unified platform that exposes the true power of a raw UNIX environment and a set of industry standards (like HTTP and SQL) for programmers; and that also, at the other end, builds on those foundations to give non-programmers access to a whole ecosystem of powerful, code-free, web-based tools for data science.\nEverything is transparent, and every tool, no matter how simple, has a “view source” button so we can all get to, edit, and learn from the code underneath.\nBut more than transparency and code, ScraperWiki has always been about community. And that’s never going to change: By sharing one platform, the power-users can learn from the programmers, or use the tools they create, while the programmers can work with each other, and use the power-user tools to simplify the boring bits of coding.\nIf that sounds like your sort of data hub, stay tuned: We’ll be introducing the new ScraperWiki in the New Year.\n If you want to know more about the theory and practice of bringing “end-user computing” (letting people make their own custom apps) to everyone, I recommend Bonnie Nardi’s book A Small Matter of Programming.", "id": "<urn:uuid:832a2a15-29c2-43c2-b50e-5eb8312986cd>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/12/31/a-small-matter-of-programming/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:33:06Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9135439395904541, "token_count": 495, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "By Candace Dempsey\nComing up: On November 18, Rudy Guede’s appeal begins and will last perhaps two days. On November 20, the trial of Amanda Knox and Raffaaele Sollecito reopens with closing arguments. On November 27, the much-postponed verdict in the abuse-of-power trial for prosecutor Giuliano Mignini may finally arrive, but … could be delayed once again. The rumor is that it may not be announced until after the verdict in the Knox/Sollecito trial. That may come as early as December 3-5.\nLawyers for Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito promise huge surprises when the world’s most tabloid-genic murder trial restarts September 14.\nShockers can’t be good news for supposed conspirator Rudy Guede. He opted for an abbreviated trial, got slammed with 30 years, and will appeal the guilty verdict on November 18. All three are accused of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith Kercher, a British exchange student, in Perugia, Italy, on November 1, 2007.\nThe problem for the prosecution: It never showed Rudy conspiring with the co-conspirators. Now PMs Giuliano Mignini and Manuela Comodi must cool their heels in Judge Giancarlo Massei’s courtroom. The defense teams for Amanda and Raffaele get to speak. Look for Raffaele’s team to take direct shots at Rudy Guede.\nThey point out Raffaele never met Rudy–except in court, never the best place to socialize. Nor has Rudy been eager to establish a buddy relationship. He’s always said he was a stranger to Raffaele, Amanda’s Italian boyfriend, a wealthy doctor’s son.\nEveryone agrees Rudy did meet both of the beautiful foreign girls, Meredith and Amanda. But only because he played basketball with the boys who lived in the downstairs flat from them at via Della Pergola 7, in the house where the murder occurred.\nNo one saw either girl out with the club-loving loafer, a jobless 20-year-old, hard-pressed to pay his rent. Amanda did place him on a police list of visitors to the downstairs flat, but couldn’t even provide his name. Stefano Bonassi, one of the downstairs boys, said Rudy had been over only two times, one night falling asleep on their toilet.\nPolice admit Rudy never called or emailed Meredith, Amanda or Raffaele. Police found no trace of them in his apartment, nor did they discover his DNA in Raffaele’s flat. Yet he is supposed to have participated in a sex game with the three college students that ended in Meredith’s refusal and death. A theory for which the prosecution has presented little evidence, other than numerous attempts to portray Amanda as sluttish and manipulative. A black widow. Judge Paolo Michelli, during the pretrial, took the conspiracy for granted. He boasted that he began his reasoning with all three suspects in the murder room. So much for innocent until proven guilty.\nOne thing is certain: Rudy didn’t belong in the upstairs flat in the cottage. He had never been a lodger, boyfriend, guest or anything else. Yet police found his DNA on the victim, inside her body, on her purse and in other locations. His conviction was no surprise.\nPolice nabbed Rudy the old-fashioned way. They found his bloody hand print on a pillowcase under the victim. They matched it to his Italian ID card and launched an international manhunt. They tracked him down in Germany, where he’d fled, sleeping on trains and river barges. German police brought him in on November 20, nearly three weeks after Meredith died. He eventually admitted he’d been in the flat on the night she was murdered, but claimed they had a date and another man had stabbed her to death. Rudy also claimed to have seen this man–a tall left-handed Italian–and grappled with him, accounting for the cuts police found on Rudy’s hands. He said he was so rattled that he took off after this encounter. Too panicked even to call for an ambulance, he left Meredith to bleed to death. He went home to change out of his bloodstained pants. He topped off the evening by joining friends at the Domus disco at 2:30 a.m. All of this by his own admission.\nBefore the trial shut down for the summer recess, Sollecito’s team managed to wedge in Rudy’s previous brushes with the law, including two break-ins in which he allegedly entered via windows and was armed with knives.\nBoth teams have sought to portray Rudy as the lone wolf of Piazza Grimana. Now they’re getting some help from the press.\nThis week the Italian glossy Oggi posted stills from CCTV camera footage taken on November 1 beginning at 7:41. Reporter Giangavino Sulas says the photos show a figure dressed like Rudy Guede leaving the parking garage and heading over to the cottage–and then coming back about 20 minutes later. The young man in the wool hat does wear a “husky” coat very similar to the one Rudy was wearing when arrested. The figure is also wearing the same shoes that Rudy admits to wearing on the night of the murder: Nike Outbreak 2s, with the telltale white stripe on the bottom.\nWhen Rudy fled Perugia, he took those shoes with him and dumped them and his bloody pants somewhere in Germany. Much later he admitted that–while wearing those shoes on the night of the killing–he had made the bloody shoe print next to Meredith’s bed. Prosecutors had blamed that print on Raffaele even when his lawyers made an appeal to the Supreme Court in Rome in April 2008. In fact, it was considered grave evidence against him.\nRudy admitted the truth in late May 2008, too late to help Raffaele, and only after police had discovered the empty Nike Outbreak 2 shoebox in his flat and matched that model to the bloody shoe print. Only then did he say, “Yes, the print is mine” to PM Mignini in a face-to-face.\nAccording to Oggi, defense experts will now display many more Rudy footprints from the murder room. Professor Francesco Vinci, of the University of Bari’s department of Forensic Medicine, has examined the pillowcase on which the victim lay. Judge Massei granted him permission to enter Rome’s forensics lab from Judge Massei. What he saw astonished him.\nAs Oggi says: “With the use of Crimescope which helps to select prints, treated chemically with fluorescing products, he found on the pillow case five good prints (3 superimposed) of a left shoe that delineates a sole that corresponds and measures exactly to a Nike Outbreak 2, size 45. Thus the foot of Guede. The disconcerting thing is that on that pillowcase the forensic police found only 2 traces: one of Guede and the other of a woman size 37.”\nThe police have tried to pin the latter print, not too convincingly, on Amanda. “Today the discovery of Prof. Vinci bewilders everyone. On this cushion only the youth of color has ‘walked.’ The report of the professor will be presented in court at the re-start of the trial and will surely be at the center of a clash between experts. Will he succeed in establishing the truth?”\nOggi contends that all of the blood-stained footprints in Kercher’s bedroom are Rudy’s size 11 Nike Outbreak 2 shoeprints. Lorenzo Rinaldi, the director of print identity in the Rome forensic police division said that in court in May 2009. Oggi goes further, saying there are no women’s shoeprints in the room at all. And all of the prints appear to be from Rudy’s left foot.\nLook for more fireworks over the missing data that made Judge Massei close down the trial early. Adriano Tagliabracci, a well-respected forensic geneticist, will be back on the stand on Monday, addressing that very issue. The judge shut down his testimony when it was discovered that defense lawyers hadn’t received all of the evidence analyzed by the forensic police in Rome. The judge demanded it all be turned over by the end of July. (Note: Judge Massei has now ruled that the defendants were not wronged by documentation withheld for a year and a half. Their lawyers continue to press for complete documentation. Many questions remain unanswered).\nThe rumor is the defense received many pages, but not the key information they were seeking.\nAs Oggi says: “They foresee other interruptions because Giulia Bongiorno, Luca Maori and Luciano Ghirga, the defense lawyers of Sollecito and Amanda, will question at least two super experts: one on the bra clasp of Mez on which was found the DNA of Sollecito, and the other on the knife, the presumed crime weapon, on which was found the DNA of Amanda and that of the victim.” We can expect “a fiery trial phase: the defense has announced sensational findings of a degree to demonstrate the innocence of the two ex-lovers and also the construction of false proof against them.”\nThe drawing below is from the Oggi story. It shows the five footprints from the murder room and–an even bigger surprise–a Rudy-attributed footprint from the famous room with the broken window (a room once occupied by Filomena Romanelli). The defense contends Rudy Guede broke in that way; the prosecution insists the broken window was part of an elaborate staging.\nWe’ll be hearing more about all six footprints in court. Below you can see the two images that will highlight the debate at the re-start of the hearing. Oggi says: “To the left, a diagram of glass lying next to a shoe print left by Rudy Guede. For the lawyers of Amanda and Raffaele this is another sign against the Ivorian: it would show that he entered the house after breaking down a window. To the right, the five prints that, to his astonishment, Prof. Vinci (Sollecito’s expert) found on the pillowcase of the cushion on which lay the body of Meredith. There is an entire left shoe print and the sole is of a Nike Outbreak 2 number 45, the same worn by Guede the night of the crime.”\nNote: The left photo shows exhibit A on the tile; the right shows the five left shoe prints on the pillowcase, one in the center, 3 overlapping ones in a group a half-step to the left, and one below the other 4, turned to the right.\n* Feet of a killer: Here is another set of footprints, said to be Rudy Guede’s, heading across the living room floor.\nStefanoni note: courtesy of Frank Sfarzo, Perugia Shock. He also has a followup on the first day of testimony, after this story was written.\nHere’s Rudy when the guilty verdict was delivered in September 2008.\nHere is a Sky News Video from November 2, 2007 at the very beginning of the case.

The work will focus on acreage in the batture — land between the water's edge and the levee. The rich land floods regularly and supports a variety of wildlife.\nThe project will involve more than 7,000 acres this year and up to 30,000 acres when completed.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in an interview that the program is targeting areas with \"pressing natural resources issues.\"\nThe program, run through the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, enlists private landowners to help restore wetlands they own.\n\"We're showing the country that voluntary conservation programs can work,\" Vilsack said.\nThe project along the Mississippi River will be carried out with the Mississippi River Trust as a partner. The trust is a charitable partner that works with private landowners often to create conservation easements. The landowner can receive tax benefits while helping preserve ecologically sensitive land.\nThe work will include restoration of 7,280 acres this year, and up to 30,000 acres once the project is completed.\nIn Iowa, the USDA is devoting $6 million to restore 1,020 acres in an area known as the Prairie Pothole Region. The work will focus on the Raccoon River wetland to improve wildlife habitat, water quality and prevent flooding in the Raccoon and Des Moines river watersheds.\nThe USDA devoted $3 million to a project along the Cache and White rivers in Arkansas, where The Nature Conservancy will work with landowners to protect or restore 2,000 acres of wetland habitat this year. When the project is complete it is planned to cover 6,000 acres.\nA smaller scale project along the Cache and L'Anguille rivers in northeast Arkansas will cost $215,000 to create conservation buffers to reduce sediment and fertilizer that runs off into the waterways.

{"text": "Horse Water Ballet\nColby: So, shifting gears (and equestrian pursuits), today the Olympic Grand Prix dressage competition got underway in Greenwich. And we kicked the day off with a proper celebration: Sarah wore the human-sized foam finger outfit (yes, that’s a thing…don’t believe me, please see our YouTube channel).\nSarah: the security guards were all about the foam finger suit, offering up smiles, laughter and high-fives all around. I did manage to set off the metal detector, thanks to my tall boot zippers and the mic pack, so they gave me a very thorough wanding, but once they were satisfied that I was just a weird American and not a terrorist, they happily let me through. So, the lesson of the day is: you can’t bring a water bottle into the venue, but a foam finger suit is a-OK.\nColby: Along with our friends from USEF, we then proceeded to spread joy to the fans by handing out “Dressage is #1″ foam fingers and encouraging the crowds to cheer for Jan and Rafalca. We created what can best be described as a scene, but it was really fun and we met some great people from all over the world.\nSarah: You would not believe how fast these things went. We literally couldn’t pull them out of the box all the way before there were three eager pairs of hands on each one. I loved how many people got really excited about it – and not just kids. 20-something guys, 60-year-old grandmas, literally everyone wanted to get in on the fun. And what fun it was. I’ve never posed for so many pictures in my whole life. It’s really weird to think that I’m now going to be tagged as “weird foam finger girl” on about a thousand different Facebook pages. And today was only Day 1 of Dressage!\nColby: After jettisoning the foam finger, so as not to incite an Olympic riot by blocking people’s view of the competition, we settled into our seats. The weather has been a recurrent theme and if you were here you would know why. We enjoyed a few beautiful rides in the sun, including leader and hometown-favorite Hester’s gorgeous ride.\nThen, ominous dark clouds rolled in and the skies opened up like I’ve frankly never seen before. The rain drops were the size of golfballs. Many went scurrying into the bowels of the stadium, but most people stuck it out. It rained so hard and so fast that we were immediately soaked to the bone and there was really no point in retreating. Steffen and Shannon Peters clearly reached the same conclusion and stuck it out in the downpour watching the competition next to us.\nThe weather was certainly a factor for some riders, including Canada’s David Marcus whose horse, Capital, did not want to play the game which unfortunately led to them being excused after a number of bucks and (unplanned) airs above the ground.\nThen, as suddenly as it started, the clouds parted and the sun came out. Sarah and I came out of our huddles, pulled out our phones and started tweeting again. Thankfully, our camera is waterproof, so we didn’t go completely dark during the deluge and got some great pics, which we are happy to share with you.\nSarah: So. Much. Rain. At times the rain was so insane that it was actually funny. I think the weirdest part was that we didn’t really try to do anything to make it better. I mean, I zipped up my raincoat, but I didn’t run for cover or anything. I think Colby had a great point in that it was such an instantaneous soaking that running really wouldn’t have done us any good. But it was a very weird feeling to just sit there and accept the pouring down rain and the soaking wet clothes as my new life. It kind of felt like being that horse that stands in the corner of the field in the midst of a downpour, even though the shed sits empty mere feet away. After sitting through it, I gotta tell you, there’s something wrong with that horse.\nAs for the actual competition, to say that the Brits came out strong would be such a tremendous understatement. Of the 26 pairs that competed today, the Team GB riders went 1 and 2 atop the leaderboard, which is beyond impressive. After Hester’s #1 ride, he joked with the media that he was worried his horse Uthopia might be deaf, given the fact that the horse is just 11 years old, has never competed in a stadium and literally didn’t bat an eye (or an ear) at the very boisterous hometown crowd.\nTeam USA only saw one rider, Jan Ebeling, go today, as Tina, Steffen and Adrienne are all slated for tomorrow. Jan put in a test that he was very happy with. The portions of the ride that he’s been focusing on (passage, piaffe and halt) all came out beautifully. They had a small bauble in the canter pirouette, but nothing drastic, and they put in a solid score of 70.243 to get the US off to a very respectable start. We caught up with Jan and several other members of the Team USA crew during the USEF Network shoot tonight, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for that.\nThe dismissal of the Canadian pair Colby mentioned above is noteworthy because now Team Canada is down to two riders, and thus eliminated from the Team portion of the competition, which you hate to see happen.\nThe final noteworthy portion of the competition was witnessing the 71-year-old Hiroshi Hoketsu put in a lovely test about the very sweet-seeming horse, Whisper.\nIn a quick post-ride interview, Hoketsu spoke about the difference between the games now and his first Olympics an astounding 48 years ago. The biggest thing he noted was the quality of the horses and the training. That really got me thinking how much we’re really working to improve the way that we breed, train and care for these magnificent animals, and, as a result, we’re elevating the sport to a whole other level. And as I reflect on that thought now, sitting in my bedroom staring out at the deconstructed cross country course, I feel incredibly proud and honored to be a part of the small role that SmartPak plays in making the world a better place for horses and their riders.\nMiss the rides and want a play-by-play?

This was the funniest event for the fans, and for the actors!\nThough all but Nadia Bjorlin (Chloe Lane) have left Days of Our Lives for greener pastures, former castmates Julie Pinson (ex-Billie Reed), Brandon Beemer (ex-Shawn Brady), along with Nadia, who, by the way, is Brandon’s real-life girlfriend, took part in the Soap Opera Trivia event! From the looks on their faces, one would think they were stumped, but every star attending made each event a once in a lifetime experience for their fans!\nIf you’d like to see all of the many photos from the first Soap Cruise, please visit Soaps.com’s Photo Events Page today!\nPhoto Credit: Soaps.com\nFun fact!

{"text": "The Young And The Restless Weekly Summary For February 27 – March 2.\nAvery confronted her father over his confession. After their father died alone, Avery sobbed apologies to Phyllis, who agreed to forgive her – until Avery admitted to freeing Daisy. Phyllis warned if Daisy got her hands on Lucy, she’d go after Avery with guns blazing. Later, Daniel arrived and found a photo of a young Phyllis and Avery in his grandfather’s belongings.\nDaisy appeared with a cop, and Nick was forced to let her visit Lucy. After Avery dropped Daisy as a client, Daisy rented an apartment next to Lauren and Michael and got a judge to grant her custody of Lucy, which forced Phyllis to hand over the baby. Nick promised to be there for Phyllis, and they reconciled. Lauren confided to Jill that she hadn’t told Michael about her gun. After Michael convinced Daniel to fight for custody of Lucy, he confronted Kevin, who claimed Angelo hadn’t forced him to marry Angelina.\nVictor told Nikki he did what he did out of love, and she forgave him. Genevieve continued to refuse Victor’s help and convinced Vikki to teach her the business from behind the scenes as the new CEO of Beauty of Nature. However, after hearing Daisy had Lucy, Vikki refused to commit. While Nick gave Sharon his blessing to have Adam move in with her, Adam went to Victor and offered to get the company back for him as a way to make up for all of the wrongs he’d done.

{"text": "We offer FREE USPS shipping on all US orders!\n« Older Entries | »\nMay is a marvellous month, with Emeralds, Lily of the Valley and Taurus as its symbols. Bold, dainty and terribly stubborn; which is a pretty good description of how this month is turning out for us in Portland, with blasting hot days, delicately warm nights and a mind of its own regarding the weather!\nAll this sun and April’s showers have made our world bright and green (and brought some of those May flowers too!). Which makes May’s gemstone very appropriate. Emeralds are green beryl, ranging from yellow-green to blue-green, but always green! And though we use the word “emerald” on only a couple of green styles, we have quite a wide representation of greens!\nMay’s flower, the lily of the valley, is like the shy cousin of the flamboyant lilies that dominate bouquets and their little bell shapes could easily be confused for any other sleepy-looking wildflower. The fleur-de-lis, on the other hand, is very recognisable. So we’ll let this stylised lily take center stage.\nLike Aries last month, the May’s constellation of Taurus isn’t as dignified in sock form as it is in star form. But dang is it adorable! Both of these cow socks even have grippy bottoms to help keep you stable.\nWhen we talk about “stockings” as opposed to “socks”, we mean the high-nylon content styles that more often than not have to be held up with a garter belt. Though most are sheer some, like the Lycra Cuban Heeled Two Tone Stockings (shown on the far right), are semi-opaque.\nOn top: Ultra Sheer Retro Backseam Stockings. Beneath, from left to right: Lycra Cuban Heel Stockings, Cuban Heel Thigh Highs, Lycra Sheer Cubans with Lace Up Tops, Lycra Cuban Heeled Two Tone Stockings.\nFlattering, fancy and just the thing to finish off a dressy outfit, nylons have a fascinating history. Though our focus here at Sock Dreams is on socks, we do carry and love stockings. And we’re also big nerds who love to share history and facts. Today I’ll share a quick overview of the history of nylons, with some helpful facts for folks interested in rocking these classic and classy stockings. If you want more info, there are great, in-depth, histories of stockings all over the place. I’m super partial to the Smithsonian’s Stocking Series.\nNylon stockings were introduced at the 1939 world’s fair by Dupont, who have a great little timeline with some awesome pictures from 1939. They decided against registering “nylon” as a trademark, so that the word would become synonymous with stockings. Early stockings had back seams and when folks had to give up their nylon stockings for the war effort, they reproduced that backseam with leg makeup (great article at GlamourDaze about it!), creating the illusion that nylons were still covering their legs. I love this picture we have on our Pinterest from the Library of Congress image archives, showing a barrel of nylons on their way to becoming parachutes and cords.\nLibrary of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection. “Here’s where your parachute came from.“\nIt’s because of this temporary lack of nylon that we have the wide range of cotton stockings and tights we see today. But that’s a story for another day! We’re still talking about nylons. Join us after the jump for comparisons of new nylon stockings to actual mid-century pairs and some helpful tips about these fantastic, feminine stockings.\nA good mama is a wonderful thing and a hard job. If you’ve got a great mom in your life you should let them know how fabulous they are all the time. And if you’re a rad mom, I hope you know how great you are. Mother’s Day is just one day out of the year (this year it’s May 12th), but it’s a chance to really treat these wonderful folks.\nWe’ve got a Mother’s Day Favourites section, but most of those styles are the ones our moms like, and if your moms are like ours, they keep their fancy stuff pretty basic. They like comfy crews, cozy bedsocks, maybe a ‘crazy’ splurge on some hand-printed trouser socks.\nBut, the best gifts are the ones that you know the giftee would never think to get themselves. Something fancy, maybe a little more than they like to spend on themselves. Our Indulgences section is a good place to go for just that sort of thing. I’m going to be honest, these are our pricier styles. But they earn their price, with fabulous fibers, fit and construction. This is where the luxurious stuff lives.\nThat doesn’t mean you have to go wild picking something out for your moms. There are some great options under $25 that feel fantastic and look gorgeous. Plus, they’re practically basics, so you won’t get chided for going overboard.\nOf course, if you can and do want to spoil your mom, we can help you there! Check out three sweet indulgences after the jump!\nApril 26th, 2013\nThey can be unsightly, those little balled-up bundles of fibers that build up on your socks. Where there’s wear, pills will happen; common causes are shoes rubbing against socks, where your thighs touch or really any spot that is subjected to abrasion.\nWool and acrylic are especially prone to pilling (though cotton, polyester and nylon like to do it too). Linen and silk are the safest from the perils of pilling. Wool has an advantage, as it is more likely to shed pill build-up. Synthetic fibers are tougher and more stubborn, keeping those pilled bits secure to the fabric. Washing pill-prone items inside out on a short, gentle cycle (or hand washing) helps prevent this kind of wear, but often it is inevitable.\nHowever or whyever there are pills, they’re a problem that you can solve. One of the most common ways is with an electric sweater shaver. Electric sweater shavers are fun and kind of loud (which is also fun). They require batteries and are sort of like a teddy bear’s version of a beard trimmer. A lot of them are even made by the same companies who make electric face razors!\nAnd one of those can bring some freshness back to a tired looking pair of socks or armwarmers, like this pair of Harajuku Arm Warmers. That area between the thumb and fingers gets a lot of wear and shows it.\nBut all it takes is turning on the sweater shaver and lightly running it over the arm warmer, either while wearing it or laying it flat. The key word here is lightly, just gently brush the shaver across the top. If you’re too rough you could put a hole in whatever you’re sprucing up, particularly if it is a delicate item.\nAnd the pills are gone, turned into easily-disposed of fluff! The softer look of a much loved-and worn item doesn’t disappear, but the pills do. It even does a solid job removing all the pills on the heels of my poor old Extraordinary Thigh Highs, which have had a lot of hard wear.\nElectric sweater shavers are definitely rad, but there have to be some non battery powered options out there, right? Tumblr Fairy Zaf prefers the Sweater Stone and I’ll walk you through that technique next. Why don’t you let us know your tips and tricks for removing pills? In looking up information on pilling I saw that some folks use the hook side of Velcro—have you tried it, does that work? I’ve definitely gone the sticky tape route myself.\nKnee highs are pretty straight forward. Our Measurements & Sizes page shows how they come to just below the knee, that’s pretty much the total of their definition. But you may have encountered the phrase “knee sock” when browsing our styles and wondered how it differed from plain ol’ knee highs.\nThere isn’t a whole lot of difference and sometimes we do use the phrase “knee sock” when we’re talking about knee highs. But, more often than not, when we call something a “knee sock” we’re talking about a sock that ends somewhere around the knee—sometimes below, sometimes above, sometimes right there in the middle of your knee cap—depending on your leg shape. The Bess Cashmere Slouch Rib Knee Socks are a perfect example of this, you can see how they end at different spots on different models’ legs:\nSince we try on all the styles we sell and almost all of the models you see in our pictures are Sock Dreams employees, we get to see how socks act on different leg types. Long legs and fuller calves mean some shorter over the knee styles don’t fairly deserve the name “OTK”. But those same socks can’t properly be called knee highs either because just as many other folks had them go over their knees. So, we started using the phrase “knee sock” to highlight that ambiguity.\nIt was Sourpuss’ styles that made us first start using the phrase more actively, they’re shorter for over the knee styles and even though Sourpuss called them OTKs, we couldn’t after testing them, even though we love them.\nThe DreaM Stockings “knees” styles are another great example of a knee sock. Available in seven variations (with lots of varieties for each!), they can be worn as over the knee socks or knee highs, depending on your legs (or on your personal taste, I prefer them as knee highs, even though I’ve got short legs).\nA way to find these in-betweeners is also to choose both “knee high” and “OTK” in Advanced Search then click the word “ALL” next to the header for Coverage. This shows you styles we’ve found fall both above or below the knee, depending on your leg. If you’ve got longer legs or fuller calves, you may already know the trick of wearing OTKs as knee highs, cuffing or double-cuffing to take care of any extra length.\nA knee sock isn’t a style that couldn’t cut it as an OTK, nor is it just an over-achieving knee high. They straddle both coverage worlds, offering their stylish services to more leg types.\n« Older Entries | »", "id": "<urn:uuid:2af20494-8ed7-4104-8c1c-a6b4e4ae8cac>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.sockdreams.com/category/sock-journal/?sc=3D466BB3C2AAA8160F1DA&o=43763869", "date": "2013-05-18T06:51:04Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9416561722755432, "token_count": 2381, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

(NYSE:MAR) announced today that more than 85 hotels will earn the ENERGY STAR label – signifying 35 percent less energy use than average buildings – from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this year. With more than 200 ENERGY STAR-labeled hotels currently, Marriott continues to lead the hospitality industry in energy management and has set a goal to certify at least eight hotels per month with the ENERGY STAR award.

{"text": "Welcome to Round Trip, a weekly feature in The Post-Standard and on Syracuse.com that gives you an inside look at a fun destination within driving' distance from Central New York. Our goal is to take you some place fun and interesting without spending more than four hours in one day in the car -- all with a keen eye on everyone's tight budget.\nHave an idea or request for where we should visit? Send an e-mail to firstname.lastname@example.org.\nWhoever said size doesn't matter, must have spent some time in Sackets Harbor, especially in the summer.\nThis charming village packs a lot of living in a tiny, tidy bundle, decorated with a beautiful waterfront, welcoming restaurants, entertaining and exciting activities and a rich history. While a round trip from Syracuse is easily done in a day, you'll need more than a day to do everything there is to do. But that's not a problem, because once you visit, you'll want to go back soon.\nThese picks will get you started. Enjoy the trip.\nOld McDonald's Farm\n14471 county Route 145, Sackets Harbor\nOpen 10 a.m. daily, May 1 through Oct. 31.\nThe 1,200-acre working farm, just a few miles outside the center of Sackets Harbor, has been open to visitors since 1986. Owner Nancy Robbins used to give children pony rides in her driveway. Friends suggested she set it up as a business; now people line up to pay for the pony rides and much more.\nAt the farm, city kids (and adults) enjoy close encounters with a wide variety of barnyard animals. There are bunnies, goats and pigs -- including handsome Fabio and gorgeous Giselle and their babies -- chickens, cows and miniature horses. One horse is named Rod Stewart because he's quite popular (and prolific) with the lady horses.\nBut even kids who live in rural areas are enchanted by the one-hump camel named Humphrey, two emus named Stretch and Stilts, three Alpacas named Marshmallow, Salsa and Paprika and a reindeer named Poinsetta, who has such a beautiful, velvety face and antlers she doesn't look real.\nAdmission to the farm costs $7 for anyone older than 1 and includes interacting with the animals, taking a spin on the Wizard of Oz-themed hayride and playing mini golf. It costs extra to bounce in the inflated playground, to ride the ponies or to feed the goats popcorn (fists full of grass are free). The half-hour dairy tour on the Moo-Town Trolley costs an additional $2 for adults, but is free for children.\nThe narrated dairy tour showcases the modern dairy industry. According to the narrator, the Robbins Farm milks 700 cows three times a day, seven days a week. Each milking takes seven hours, with an hour between shifts for the workers to sterilize the milking parlor. Visitors see the cows mill about in a free stall barn and stroll to the milking parlor when they feel the need. In the calf nursery barn, you may see a newborn baby struggling to its feet for the first time.\nOf course, if you suffer from hay fever or other allergies, you can always opt to stay behind in Old McDonald's Laughing Cow Cafe or confine yourself to communing with toy animals in the gift shop.\nMain Street, Sackets Harbor\nOpen 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through Christmas. Winter hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday through Sunday during January, February and March.\nWhile Sackets Harbor's business district is just a few blocks long, it doesn't lack for inviting shops. One that's particularly intriguing is the Handmaiden's Garden on Main Street.\nThe shop, which is deceptively spacious, greets visitors with a veritable fairy fantasyland, filled with, of course, fairies as well as every possible fairy accouterment known to man or elf. There's fairy clothing, furniture, houses, ornaments, collectibles, jewelry and an assortment of boxes and other precious items designed to facilitate the tooth fairy's exchange of legal tender for teeth.\nBut the store doesn't end there. Walk up a couple steps and you're in a mini bookstore with floor to ceiling shelves stocked with New Age books, games and spiritual and psychic aids.\nKeep moving, and you'll find a couple of rooms devoted to Sacket Soapworks, which offers custom scenting, all-natural bath and body lotions, potions and soaps. Connie Nicolette, the shop owner, grows the herbs in her garden and makes more than a ton of soap in her workshop each year, which she sells in the shop, online and at the Sterling Renaissance Festival.\nNicolette started selling her handmade soaps at the Henderson Harbor Farmers Market back in 1996 as a way to make extra money and still home-schools her children. She enlisted her then 12-year-old son to help launch and build the business, equipping him with business cards and a computer. One of his home-school assignments was to design and make labels for the business. Nicolette's daughter, Cassidy, and her fascination with fairies, led her to begin stocking and selling fairy paraphernalia, a sideline that has become just as lucrative as the bath and body business.\nThrough her business, Nicolette says she hopes to help others appreciate nature and a world filled with wonder.\n\"Children are getting so stuck into this high-tech world of games, they're losing their imagination,\" she says. \"I just want to give that back ... and bring little ones back to nature.\"\nKaren's Kafe & Bistro\nWest Main Street, Sackets Harbor\nOpen 11 a.m. daily.\nOwner Karen Bendix earned Philly cheesesteak fame at her former restaurant, Karen's at Brookside, near Princeton, N.J. When the state of New Jersey seized the property under eminent domain for an intersection, Bendix closed the doors after 30 years and carried her recipes to Sackets Harbor to start over.\nThe transplanted restaurant, which Bendix estimates has attracted at least 1,000 of her former customers to Sackets Harbor, became Karen's Kafe & Bistro. It's a petite place in the heart of town with a sunny outdoor seating area that dwarfs the building, featuring large colorful umbrellas and plenty of comfortable seating.\nThe Philly steaks still steal the show, with 16 varieties including one called Cusabi, which has a cucumber and horseradish dressing. Another favorite is the Ruben Cheese Steak with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing. Side dish choices include favorites like sweet potato fries and Karen's version of that Canadian favorite, poutine. Her version features french fries topped with mozzarella cheese, jalapeno peppers and red sauce.\nTreats like the Family & Friends Banana Sundae, a jumbo confection big enough to feed a crowd, and 100 flavors of shakes and smoothies, are made with homemade ice cream. Be sure to ask about the Oxymoron Extraordinaire and the Pie du Jour. Wine and beer are available, including locally-brewed 1812 Amber Ale.\nKaren brags that her staff is a \"friendly, fun-loving, hysterically funny group\" and the busier the place gets, the wilder they behave, all with her blessing. And, when yucky weather forces diners inside the tiny 25-seat restaurant, she says it often gets raucous, turning into one big, boisterous group, all sharing conversation and laughs, table-to-table.\nAnd, according to the menu, four-legged customers are welcome as well.\n\"Ask your server for complimentary dog biscuits, water available upon request,\" the menu reads.\nIf you're in town, stop by, pull up a chair, grab a spoon and just wait for someone to order one of those giant sundaes.\nHistory of Sackets Harbor\n501 W. Main St., Sackets Harbor\n646-1529, Museum Web site\nHours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and noon to 3 p.m. Sundays June 1 through Labor Day.\nSackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site\nWest Main Street, Sackets Harbor\nHours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday through Saturday and 1 to 5 p.m. Sundays through Labor Day.\nThe site is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Labor Day.\nHours change to 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 1 to 5 p.m. Sundays from Labor Day to Columbus Day.\nThe grounds are open sunrise to sunset daily.\nIn case you've forgotten, the United States declared war on Great Britain in the War of 1812. The reasons were varied, but the bottom line was the Americans hoped to finally kick the British out of the rest of North America, aka Canada. Some historians see the 1812 conflict as a second Revolutionary War, but it doesn't seem to get the respect that the first one got. Except in Sackets Harbor.\nAccording to the Chamber of Commerce's 2009 Visitors' Guide, the village, located just 30 miles across Lake Ontario from Canada, had been an important shipping and shipbuilding center, which made it a natural choice to be the northern frontier headquarters for the U.S. military in 1812.\nSackets Harbor has carefully preserved the history of its role in fighting the British and Canada to keep them from claiming this part of the country.\nHistory aficionados can walk the 32-acre hallowed ground of the Sackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site, observing the Memorial Tree Grove and monument on the site of the former Navy Yard. During the summer, the park's Living History Camp features actors depicting soldiers and other characters who might have lived there during the War of 1812. They take their roles very seriously.\nFor a nominal admission fee, visitors may tour a home inhabited by a dozen different U.S. Navy Commandants and their families. In what was the site of the former stable, visitors may participate in hands-on naval activities such as lifting different size cannon balls, pulling boat rigging and sighting and firing a cannon at an enemy ship that appears to be tossing on the high seas.\nWhen the cannon is fired, the cannonball can be heard screaming toward its target. A direct hit results in a loud explosion, followed by sailors shouting and wailing. Miss, and the sailors laugh at your ineffective attempt. Next door, in the mini theater, two DVDs about the War of 1812 and the Battle of Sackets Harbor play continually.\nThe nearby Pickering-Beach Historical Museum depicts Harbor life in the mid-19th century. According to the Web site (www.sacketsharborny.com), local legend says an unrestored cottage on the property, which is next to the battlefield, served as a hospital during the War of 1812.\nJust to prove there are no lingering hard feelings after all these years, Sackets Harbor invites its Canadian neighbors to the 38th annual Can-Am Festival (www.canamfestival.com) on July 18 and 19, to thank them for being such good neighbors.\nDirections to Sackets Harbor from Syracuse according to Google Maps:\nTake Interstate 81 North about 60 miles to exit 42 (NY 177 toward Adams Center/Smithville).\nTurn left at County Highway 66/County Route 66/S Harbor Road/NY 177 (follow signs for Smithville.) Follow highway for 3.7 miles.\nTurn left at County Route 145/North Harbor Road. Follow for 1.4 miles\nSlight right at County Route 75/Smithville Road will lead you into the village.\nMileage: About 68 miles from Syracuse.", "id": "<urn:uuid:ec3bddc3-861f-4b29-adfe-6f14495a8bc1>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.syracuse.com/entertainment/2009/07/round_trip_to_sackets_harbor_i.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:51:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9516786932945251, "token_count": 2474, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "To the Editor:\nI am so excited about the governor's bill pending approval from the Senate on marriage equality, and wrote my state senators for support. I just got an e-mail reply from Sen. David Valesky saying, \"I have continuously supported civil unions for the purpose of benefits for couples, as opposed to same-sex marriage.\"\nI was so disappointed! Sen. Valesky, hasn't history shown us time and again that separate is not equal? Marriage is a civil contract, and in New York state alone, 1,324 rights and responsibilities come with that \"contract.\" I know for a fact that many of these rights cannot be obtained legally in any other way than by having a marriage certificate.\nIf your personal beliefs or religion oppose same-sex marriage I can respect that, but please be aware that civil marriage is not the same as religious marriage, which is sanctioned by the faith of a person's choice. Having civil marriage equality will not compel any religious entity to perform same-sex marriages unless they see fit to do so. The separation of church and state will continue to exist!\nMy same-sex spouse and I were legally married in Massachusetts last summer, and certainly do not want to be considered \"civilly unioned\"! We are married just like any other committed, loving couple. Our friends, family and our community in Syracuse all respect us and our marriage. We love each other, we take care of one another, and we are committed to each other just like any other married couple. Is it really possible that Dave Valesky doesn't have any same-sex couples as friends or relatives, and just has no frame of reference for this?\nUnless civil unions will impart the exact same rights and responsibilities, this is certainly not equality under the law for New York citizens such as myself and my spouse. And, Mr. Valesky, if you are implying that your support of civil unions will impart the exact same rights and responsibilities under the law, then please call it marriage, because that's what it is!\nPolitical gain and personal opinions aren't going to last forever on this issue, and civil rights will eventually prevail, as they have throughout history. Sixty years ago, blacks and whites could not legally marry each other, yet I doubt there is a politician in New York today who would dare suggest now that they shouldn't have that right. I would hope that Sen. Valesky would rather be known as a leader who did what was right instead of a leader who tried to sustain a category of second-class citizens.\nReligious conservatives just want to follow God's law\nTo the Editor:\nMost newspaper opinion letters hit the religious right very hard -- considering them bigots for wanting to deny civil rights of marriage to gay couples. As one of the religious right, it is evident to me they don't know the real reasons for our wanting to keep marriage between a man and a woman.\nIt starts with our core beliefs that put God first in our lives -- not government. We believe our Creator instilled a special spirit within us that is the distinguishing essence of our humanity. Furthermore, we believe we were created by God so that we may choose to love God and others with a selfless and enduring spiritual love.\nWith that affirmed, it follows we want marriage to be what God wants, and we believe that to be a promise to God from a man and a woman to love each other spiritually and to nurture children with the same spiritual love. For it is this marriage that gives children their best chance for happiness and perpetuates all-important family love.\nTo those who are gay, we can only hope they also choose to love God and others spiritually so that they, too, will find happiness on Earth and have their souls merit heaven.\nPlease believe it isn't that the religious right wants to deny gay couples their civil rights; it is that we are trying our best to live our lives in accordance with God's wishes.\nGay couples sometimes do better at raising kids than others do\nTo the Editor:\nIt has been interesting to keep up with the ongoing debate about gay marriage on these pages. I won't claim to know what God's sense of this is, as many writers claim to. Like John Spong, the Bible scholar and Episcopal bishop of New Jersey, wrote, God is way too awesome, and us trying to figure out God is like an earthworm trying to figure us out.\nPragmatically speaking, gay marriage isn't a problem. No marriage is. I noticed in the obits today that the man shot dead by police in a gunfight had four children, with four different women, in four states, and wasn't caring for any of them. The foster care system here in Onondaga County is filled with parentless kids: My wife and I know -- we've cared for two of them.\nI've been working on a documentary film about school dropouts, and if there is one common theme among dropouts, it is that they come from single- or no-parent homes. On the other hand, I am personally familiar with three gay couples who have adopted children, and those kids are thriving. Gay couples may not be able to have biological kids of their own, but they sure are picking up the slack left behind by the legions of irresponsible heterosexual procreators.\nSame-sex marriage is opposed to moral law\nTo the Editor:\nI do not believe in same-sex marriage. It is against nature and against moral law. The same-sex couple cannot physically complement each other as in heterosexual marriage.\nNow, having said this, I will be accused of being narrow-minded, homophobic, judgmental and a religious fanatic.\nMost people do not accept everything that comes down the pike; we are not that broad-minded. Jesus said in the Bible that you either follow him or Satan. It is one or the other, nothing in-between. Already in this country, people whose religious convictions preclude acceptance of this lifestyle are verbally and even physically persecuted. But Jesus told us this would happen if we followed Him.\nAn example of this is Miss California, Carrie Prejean, in the Miss USA Pageant, when she said she did not believe in same-sex marriage. Perez Hilton and many others like him verbally persecuted her.\nThe gay marriage advocates want to put us on the defense; that is part of their strategy. And for those who think I am judgmental, I am judging behavior, not the individual, for that would be placing myself as God. That is His domain. Our country has gone amok with all this political correctness to the point many, but not the majority, want God eliminated in all aspects that are against the gay agenda.\nLet me point out to those who cannot see the forest because of the trees: Sodom and Gomorrah is already here. And What a great fall the United States will have if and when God lets His wrath rain down upon us ... unless we change our immoral and amoral ways.\nJames D.

{"text": "I’ve been writing this blog for about 5 years now, and anyone who has had the endurance to follow me for this long probably can identify my overarching theme – Investing is not as easy as it looks – do your homework before investing or get professional help. In this era of 24/7 news coverage of the financial markets, it might appear tempting to conclude that all one needs to do is listen to the free advice offered by the “experts” quoted in the media to make a killing in the markets. As I often suggest, there is nothing as potentially costly as free advice…\nA quick check of some of today’s postings on Seeking Alpha (a popular financial markets website) yielded the following investment recommendations:\n1) Buy master-limited partnerships\n2) Sell bonds\n3) Buy U.S. treasury bond exchange-rated funds\n4) Buy the yen\n5) Buy single family houses\n6) Buy companies selling SUVs in China\n7) Buy gold\n8) Sell gold\n9) Buy emerging market debt, but only in local currency\nWithout commenting on the merits of any of these “recommendations,” I would submit that a portfolio based on all of these ideas would be a messy hodge-podge indeed. This is the key problem with most bits of free investment advice – no context. Successful investing, in my view, starts with a plan or a goal. Investing in something just to make money may be an acceptable notion, but it is unlikely to lead a person to his or her long-term financial and life goals. In addition to having a plan, being adequately diversified in one’s investments and having some program for risk management are other necessary components of a successful investment approach.\nWay too much of the capital markets commentary I see out there feels like snake oil sales. Laying aside the possibility of pure humanitarian altruism, why would someone give you valuable, actionable and profitable investment advice for free?\nThus was my surprise so great when I heard something I deemed to be very valuable offered for free to everyone listened. The source was David Einhorn, a very vocal (and quite successful) hedge fund manager, whose public pronouncements can often impact stock prices. In my opinion, his motivation in speaking publicly about stocks seems obvious – he wants others to join with him in the trades he has already made. People seem anxious to play along, and we can often see a stock move up or down based on Mr. Einhorn’s views on it.\nSo, it was very refreshing to hear him say at a recent conference, “It doesn’t make sense to blindly follow me or anyone else into a stock.” He added, “Do your own work.” I couldn’t agree more. I see too many individual investors trying to invest as a sideline or a hobby with limited resources and limited understanding of the principles involved. I hear countless stories of someone buying a stock because of a newspaper or Internet article, a “tip” from a relative or friend, or the compelling comments of a “guru” on television. This ought not to be.\nFind a plan, diversify and monitor risk. Absent this, hire a professional. If you still want to “invest” like Jim Cramer, open up a small account (one that will have no significant impact on your net worth) and as my son often says, “Follow your heart.” Actionable or not, I’ve heard much worse advice…", "id": "<urn:uuid:3df943b1-ca01-4c77-b7a8-ea5fc4e4f705>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.thewolfgroup.com/?cat=1", "date": "2013-05-18T07:12:52Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9662799835205078, "token_count": 739, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Our opinion: Fostering better nutrition is a key to reducing public health costs. That makes the scarcity of large grocery stores in some urban neighborhoods, especially poor ones, a matter of public policy.\nIt’s easy, and comforting, to assume that in an modern, industrialized nation, everyone eats well. Surely with programs like food stamps, even needy people are doing OK, right?\nMore than 40,000 people in Albany and Schenectady live in what are known as food deserts — places where a grocery store is at least a mile away. Many are poor. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that about 3,700 of the more than 23,000 people in Albany who don’t live near a large grocer are poor. In Schenectady, about 5,400 of the more than 19,000 people for whom a supermarket trip is more like a trek are low income. Moreover, those estimates were based largely on information gathered before a recession that has made even more people poor.\nThat’s not just an inconvenience. It’s a public health issue in a society where the problems associated with poor nutrition and obesity are linked to the growing cost of public health care.\nOne suggestion for alleviating the problem comes from the American Cancer Society, which is reviving the controversial idea of a tax on soda and other sugar-sweetened drinks. The group suggests using the tax to help fund and evaluate child obesity programs. An even more productive use might be to devote a portion of such a tax to local efforts to lure larger grocery stores to urban neighborhoods that don’t have them now.\nIt would seem doubtful, though, that the state Legislature will be any more inclined to implement a soda tax than it was last year, when it refused to do so even with the prospect of raising $400 million in new revenue and even with the urging of the state health commissioner and then-Gov. David Paterson.\nThat doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying for a soda tax — encouraging kids in particular to cut back on sugary beverages is not a bad goal at all, nor is raising funds that could be used to promote a healthier citizenry. But the more likely reality is that New York and communities will have to find ways to do something about poor nutrition and food deserts without the help of a soda tax.\nHere’s one direction: Since last March, Capital District Community Gardens has been supplying nine convenience stores and markets with fresh produce under a five-year, $175,000-a-year grant from the state Health Department that also helps underwrite fitness programs. Veggie Mobile Sprout, as this program is called, delivers produce twice a week at wholesale prices, enabling urban stores in Albany and Schenectady to sell fresh food at supermarket rates and offer something better than their typical fare of often fattening and less nutritious processed food. The program’s goal is to become self-sustaining.\nHow many more ideas to promote healthy and affordable food choices are there that might perhaps benefit from some initial public investment or other support? Why not make identifying and nurturing those ideas part of the mission of local community development or economic development entities?\nFunding for such programs would not be handouts; beyond improving nutrition and reducing obesity with a long-term eye toward reducing public health costs, they would help get greater value out of the public assistance that goes to people in low-income neighborhoods.\nSounds like a shopping cart full of public interest to us.", "id": "<urn:uuid:fc2b2237-bb58-4d64-ab60-655ff3250f48>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.timesunion.com/opinion/green-up-%E2%80%A8urban-deserts/16365/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:22:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9627323150634766, "token_count": 725, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

We also went to the Museum of Natural History and saw the dinosaur skeletons which was cool, then we went to the Lincoln Memorial which is the opera house etc. Whilst visiting Grand Central Station we stumbled across a movie set where we could stop and watch as they set things on fire and the Director shouted at people to get off the street and onto the sidewalk (note my use of the American slang!)\nSunday, we went Downtown to Wall Street and the Statue of Liberty and took a boat trip around that and Ellis Island which took about 4 hours and was scorching!\nToday we went up Rockefeller Centre and saw the whole city, it is crazy tall, and when you fly up in the elevator your have to swallow to unblock your ears you are going so fast. Then we went to Madison Square Park where all the locals were sitting on Labor Day (we didn't know it was a long weekend until we got here so that's perfect timing) watching the US Open.

{"text": "The Balkan Countries\nTrip Start Apr 27, 2009\n16Trip End Ongoing\nMap your own trip!\nShow trip route\nI decided that I didnt want to be a normal tourist and take a plane back to Zagreb from Dubrovik. I was trying to get to Sofia, Bulgaria and the quickest way is thru Montenegro - passing Kosovo and then into Serbia.\n24 hours of traveling:\nI caught a 5 hour bus ride from Dubrovnik to Podgorica, Montenegro. Montenegro is a country that I would love to rent a car, bike, moped and just travel up and down the harbor. What a beautiful chunk of earth! Met a German and a girl from Macedonnia which was super helpful in getting me a ticket to my next destination.\nNow Im in the capital of Montenegro and there really is not much. My original plan was to stay the night but after first sight I thought it would be best to just keep traveling. I got an 11 hour bus ride to NIS, Serbia. I felt like I was back in Ecuador. First off I could not fit in my seat so I had to turn and face the aisle. The guy next to me thought it was ok to sit/lay on half my seat. I was scared crapless to recline because I had some fat guy behind me and I think his stomach was already touching my seat without me reclining. Every hour or so I would recline an inch just to see how he would react and by the fourth hour I was finally reclined which wasnt much. There was a negative to this. The fat guy had no where to put his arms so he thought it would be ok to put them on my head. I could feel his breath on my hair and the bronchitis cough that he had was directed towards my neck. I would try to anticipate his coughs and turn my head to the cough so his disease would not land on my skin.\nSome guy in the back of the bus was drinking and playing loud local music the whole freakin time. Remember this is an overnight bus. No one seemed to care so I had to follow suit. For about 10 minutes I wanted to scream \" Let me off this GOD forsaken bus\" but then I just had to think about good old Ecuador. The only difference is that I could not communicate with the people on the bus and I really did not know how safe it was for an American to travel.\nWhich leads me to my next story. I was trying to keep the American thing on the DL (Down LOw) but when they collected our passports at the borders they would read off the names and everybody had Russian sounding names and then it comes to me and he just butchers my name and now its clear that Im the only foreigner on the bus.\nI didnt eat anything because I never knew which currency they used. Half the time during that ride I didnt know what country I was in.\nTook a local bus from Nis to the border of Serbia and Bulgaria.\nI have noticed that when I do ask for help people are very friendly and the younger generation seems to know English well.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1cbf3224-530f-40ea-a276-0195ac90b6d4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/jabuofr/2/1242892560/tpod.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:12:05Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.988362193107605, "token_count": 650, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

We got up, got ready, got everything packed up, stripped the beds, garbage out, final cleaning, and we were ready to go...an hour early! So we hung around and watched the clock tick, watched some t.v., listened to the radio.\nThe shuttle was to pick us up at 10:30 am. The guys that were picking up the keys were supposed to be there before that. The clock was getting ever closer to 10:30 and no sign of the guys. Sigh. Finally at 10:20 the kids started to take the bags downstairs. I started to follow, but the phone rang\nIt was the shuttle people saying the guy was there, waiting, and I had 10 minutes. OMG! I was trying to figure out what the heck I would do if the guys didn't show up...what would I do with the keys? There was a couple coming in this same day to take our place, they needed the keys. The owner had left for vacation in Morocco. Crap!\nSo as I finally started to go downstairs, I see DS taking the elevator down (it's glass). He had gone up one floor, then down, for fun. Then I went down with my bag. When I got at the bottom, this old French guy reprimands me (in French) that DS is too little to ride the elevator by himself and he might \"panique.\" If I had not been \"paniqueing\" myself about the keys vs. the shuttle, I would have laughed at the guy. But as it was, I said, \"Oui, oui\" knowing I'd never see the guy again. Do the French raise their kids to be sissies or what? My son is eight years old for crying out loud.\nSo I helped the kids get in the shuttle with the luggage and told the guy I had to wait for the key guys. I then went inside the courtyard to wait. Fortunately, not long after that one of the guys showed up. He seemed surprised that the other guy was not there. I told him I needed to go. I gave him the keys, he went up to check everything, came back down and said everything was ok, and then we left.\nWe had the same shuttle driver as when we got to Paris. This time he seemed in a better mood though. There was some older gentleman in the front seat next to him, so they talked (in French) the whole ride to the airport.\nWe got checked in and waited for our flight to board.

{"text": "On that midnight train to Georgia\nTrip Start Apr 18, 2011\n65Trip End Dec 09, 2011\nMap your own trip!\nShow trip route\nWhere I stayed\nAtlanta becomes a city of firsts for myself; first baseball game, first Amtrak train, first revolving bar, first hitchhike for a car. In fact my first glimpse of the Georgian capital's skyline promptly brought with it another first- sharing a taxi to the hostel with a 70 year old Brisbane resident called Dorothy- I resist the temptation to ask if has been to Kansas yet.\nIt's a fair deal though, she doesn't really know of anywhere to stay and I'm skint; she pays, I direct. The hostel is a renovated old brothel (better than it sounds) but it looks like some serious cash was spent on it sometime around the end of the 70s. It has character, stained glass windows, hearts ingrained into the banisters, the huge balconies are really nice- this feels like I've entered the south\nI'm not in the deep south but I get my first real taste of southern hospitality. Dave a two week resident of the hostel (waiting to move into a new apartment) sees it as his duty to show tourists the best parts of Atlanta but at local rates.\nFrom the $1 Major League Baseball tickets, to free entry into strip clubs. He frequently exclaims at random points throughout my stay \"I like to have a good time\", and I struggle to disagree with him. My first night is one of the best I've had on my journey so far. Sneaking alcohol into the Braves vs. Brewers game ensures the seemingly slow pace of baseball and the occassional thud of leather on bat becomes just a beat to chat over, meet some more locals and enjoy the Atlanta skyline. I witness my first home run and feel like the dollar ticket just might have been worth it.\nFrom here Dave takes us (myself, Johannes and Marcel) to the Westin hotel, apparently the tallest hotel in the western hemisphere, where we are privy to its revolving bar and expensive drinks prices. Not satisfied with the ratio of drinks prices to calibre of view we move onto an extremely dodgy strip club\nStumbling out the bar at closing we hitch a lift off a rather large guy called Greg (initially the decision to hitchike was considered a safe option considering the neighbourhood we would otherwise have to walk through, and the fact Dave looked like he'd be handy if anything did kick off- however considering the size of our driver I think that second assumption would have been fundamentally flawed). Either way, we made it back safe and sound, and a little bit more experienced after my first taste of Georgia life.\nSeeing my Atlanta visit as a place to rest after two weeks of intense travelling, I take it easy for my remaining few days- but this too also brings to light the limited number of things to visit. I miss out the CNN and Coca Cola museums but don't feel at any great loss. It seems the Atlanta Olympics brought with them a great surge of investment which has left a legacy no bigger than a commemorative water fountain/park and several large hotel chains\nI enjoy my time here- not really as a result of the buildings and monuments that document the city's history. But once again down to the people I meet. It is all too clear that hostel folk have one common trait- the will to explore. Whether motivations stem from an indecisiveness of life's direction, the need to escape or just the desire to find something different to work toward. I miss home, but I love the fact that most people I meet have a laidback philosophy and an underlying need for change, for excitement- I just wonder whether this craving ever stops.\nFor now it definitely doesn't, I sit on another train, this time bound for the Big Easy, New Orleans. I travel down with another German called Max who has just spent 7 months in Ecuador and although two years younger than me, I feel like he could very easily pass for 30- a seasoned traveller. Marcel and Johannes will meet up with us again tomorrow but I am all too aware that after this stint to Louisianna we will all go our seperate ways.

{"text": "TSA employees have posted that they will limit medical items at the checkpoint.TSA management has not made statement correcting these poorly trained screeners.How many TSO's are qualified to practice medicine?Why are TSO's so poorly trained that they do not understand the exceptions to the 311 policies.When will TSA make a public statement about this?\nAs recently as December, 2007, the passenger screening areas at Kansas City International Airport (MCI) had signage that inaccurately states that photo identification is required in order to enter the secure area. Some of the signs bear the TSA seal.I suspect this is in violation of OMB's Agency Information Quality Guidelines.I photographed these signs and have posted them here, here, and here.\nI'm not surprised you've been shocked by some of the comments left. I've been pretty shocked too.The thing that is the most shocking to me is that people are posting the most horrific stories of flagrant abuse by TSO's like patients with a medical need, babies and small children being denied water and food! A basic, human right and yet the TSA is confiscating baby food, telling parents just how much food they can bring to feed their children. The TSA is abusing the elderly and the sick by forcing them to remove shoes and belts, throwing away water, confiscating needed medicines or creams and so much more. I'm shocked at how many stories there are of items so commonplace as to be ridiculous being confiscated.Please, post a video of an explosive that can be made to resemble peanut butter (down to the smell), or strawberry jam, or barbecue sauce or any of the other hundreds of thousands of items that people carry with them on a daily basis. I've seen some answers to some of the questions here, but I've yet to see anyone address the liquids ban convincingly. If it looks like peanut butter and it smells like peanut butter, why is it considered a \"gel\"? It's food, not a dangerous substance! If I'm facing a 2-3 hour pre-boarding time, plus a 5-6 hour flight, yes I want to bring real food with me and so do people who are diabetic, have medical conditions, are traveling with children or have dietary restrictions for any reason. The TSA counters that you can get food behind the security check but for real, when one single banana costs $1.50 or more, a small 16 oz. bottle of water goes for $2-3 and there isn't any \"real\" food to get behind the security lines besides an expensive, greasy pile of fries or a scone from Starbuck's this is just not an option. And as countless people have pointed out, you can't find baby food or formula behind those security lines. Neither can you find healthy food, vegetarian food, halal food, kosher food, vegan food, inexpensive food, non-wheat-based food (celiac disease), low-sodium food, or any other number of representative dietary restrictions. Flying is an all-day ordeal for many, as there are very few cross-country flights which don't have at least one stop, and yet the TSA expects people not to pack food! Some of the ridiculous items I've personally had confiscated in this specific category: a brick of solid cream cheese (a gel!) a home-packed tub of chunky peanut butter (a gel!) slices of cheese (a gel! how do you slice a gel? It's a mystery!). Not to mention the countless times that I have had to throw out a half a 4 oz. bottle of expensive face cream, even though there was clearly not even close to 4 oz. left in the bottle. The most frustrating part is when you say, \"well we can't post our rules, then the \"terrists will win\"and then you get all upset with us, the traveling public, when we can't follow the rules you won't tell us about! And then, when we run into something like never stopping to consider that something as commonplace and easily identifiable as peanut butter will get taken away, because we've never thought about it as a \"gel\", well we're just told to shut up and follow the rules! Then we are told we can't see a list that says something as simple as \"food items such as cheese and peanut butter fall under the \"gel\" category, so don't even try\" because the the \"terrists\" would know that peanut butter and cheese were banned substances! Follow the logic on that one for a minute!\nAnybody care to comment on this idea from Lamperd which has garnered interest from DHS (Paul Rudwaldt):\"A method of providing air travel security for passengers traveling via an aircraft comprises situating a remotely activatable electric shock device on each of the passengers in position to deliver a disabling electrical shock when activated; and arming the electric shock devices for subsequent selective activation by a selectively operable remote control disposed within the aircraft. The remotely activatable electric shock devices each have activation circuitry responsive to the activating signal transmitted from the selectively operable remote control means. The activated electric shock device is operable to deliver the disabling electrical shock to that passenger.\"That DHS/TSA would even think to consider something like this is an abomination as well as a total waste of taxpayer money.\nI am a retired Naval Officer with a hip replacement plus other metalic parts which set your machine off every time I go to the airport. As you have access to my service record of 24 years plus I would pay for a security check for the last 30 years then could I get a chip embedded in my shoulder that eliminate the 10 minute individual check at the airport plus let me keep my shoes on. They are hard to get on without the LONG SHOE HORN that disabled people use.

However, they display signage with inaccurate information, some of it bearing the TSA seal.\"And no matter where you fly you are required to show a phot ID.\"Sir or Madam, you are mistaken. Passengers on domestic flights are not required to present credentials (to \"show I.D.\").Please see this letter from Jeffrey R. Sural of the TSA to Senator John Warner confirming that domestic passengers are not required to show any I.D. at airport security checkpoints.Please see also this air travel screening information on the TSA Web site, where they state, \"We encourage each adult traveler to keep his/her airline boarding pass and government-issued photo ID available until exiting the security checkpoint.\" Note: that's \"encourage\" not \"require\".I have recently posted related comments to this blog here, here, here, here, here, and here.For more information, see \"What's Wrong With Showing ID\" at The Identity Project.\n\"To the retired Naval Officer.

FYI TSA is doing inspections on some trains.The retired Navy Officer is disabled. Your flippant attitude reflects what we, the traveling public, have come to expect from TSA/inspectors at airports.\nThe terrorists do a risk/reward assessment of their attacks. OBL was really amazed at what, with a small investment, they were able to accomplish. That being said the next attacks probably won't involve the airlines since we nailed the barn door shut after the animals all ran into the woods. As to IED and aircraft, they don't give terrorists the reward they seek.\nI have noticed at some airports that the security lines will have a person greeting the people coming in and making sure that they have a ziplock bag for the liquid items. These folks are so nice and in alot of cases older. They are alot like the greeters at Sam's. I think this little bit of kindness and preperation up front will keep the rest of the security from being angry and will improve all relations. Stop a person from getting frustrated and offer up something as small as a ziplock bag, a trash can for drinks and a friendly smile. I think you might have a winner.\nI have sent the following to TSA and to my state representatives. I would some relief from the problems of being handicapped and getting through the TSA screening. As you will see it is a horrible experience.This is the letter that I sent out: I have had many bad experiences dealing with TSA agents while traveling. Yesterday was just the straw that broke my spirit and patience. I am handicapped, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and have been treated like a criminal, a child, like I am stupid, and like a terrorists. This needs to stop. I know that I am not alone in this problem I have witnessed people with many different problems treated badly, humiliated and threatened. I need to know a list of persons that I can start to contact. I want the name, phone number, and email addresses of the people that oversee all of the TSA activities and training. I would also like to see the EXACT information that TSA agents are trained to especially in regards to dealing with the handicapped. Since every airport seems to follow different rules, at this point I am assuming that there are NO standard rules. Here are the two scenarios that I am interested in: 1.) Handicapped person can not remove shoes and walk. The person alarms when walking through the detector..What happens now? 2.) Handicapped person can not remove shoes and walk. The person does not alarm when walking through the detector...What happens now? I want to see the EXACT wording in the formal documentation that tells the TSA police what to do. Thank you for your time and effort in clearing up my expectations when traveling the \"Friendly\" airways of my country.\nI need the name, email, and address for the Director of Federal Security at the Albany Airport to notify him/her of the egregious separation of my eight-year-old daughter from my girlfriend while going through security together. Then security patted my eight-year-old daughter down in a manner that I would be arrested for child molestation if I did it, while she was crying for her mother. Standard TSA policy? Does the TSA not recognize that children can be snatched up and away by evil people during such times. If the TSA is so paranoid about security, doesn't the TSA have a policy of accompanying a child they deem a security risk through the security check point when they have separated them from the adult in charge?\n\"I am handicapped, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and have been treated like a criminal, a child, like I am stupid, and like a terrorists. This needs to stop. I know that I am not alone in this problem I have witnessed people with many different problems treated badly, humiliated and threatened.\" (just part of the post).I'd like the blogger staff to take a serious look at what the above poster stated, and give us your best thoughts about how disabled people, the elderly, and childrencan be treated in a more humane and professional manner. I will state again that a Passenger Bill of Rights should be prominently posted before and after every checkpoint, with the names and phone numbers of the shift supervisors.\nGripe:TSOs at Nashville trying to determine my immigration status and not knowing enough to figure out what they are looking at.Grins:The TSOs at Richmond who are so friendly that the entire process becomes virtually pain free. If all your employees acted the way the Richmond folks did, then the complaints section on this site would be dramatically reduced.\nHi.I had an umbrella confiscated by the TSA at the Portland (Oregon) Memorial Coliseum prior to a Barack Obama rally because \"it was too long.\" The woman would not tell me where we could pick up these confiscated items afterwards, and by the time the rally ended the TSA were long gone, and so were the umbrellas. This in a city where it rains and lots of people have umbrellas. At no time prior to the rally was I ever told that umbrellas were too long to carry into the arena.I have two requests: The next time your organization runs security at an event, please make sure to tell the organizers exactly what attendees can and cannot bring (the only warning about forbidden items was about large bags, which are always forbidden at the Coliseum).The second request--please stay around until the end of the event so that people have a chance to retrieve their items. This has lots of problems at an airport where travellers may never come back, but everyone going into the Coliseum went back out of it, so most of those items will be reclaimed. If that can't be done with current staffing levels, leave the stuff in a pile outside... or tell us where to claim it.Thanks for having this blog, I really appreciate it.--Darrick\nI would like to start by saying that I believe TSA employees are conducting the job they were hired to do with respect and vigilance. Are there times when a situation is not handled to everyone's liking? Sure. Unfortunately we all tend to remember the uncomfortable situations because of their personal nature rather than the positive experiences. Passengers have and will continue to experience frustating screening situations, as TSA employees will continually be faced with abusive passengers, but this is not the norm. 95% of what I've experienced is security being conducted by courteous and professional individuals attempting to protect us, and passengers that appreciate and are thankful for the protection. Let's correct the issues, but also try to focus on the positive.\n\"I am a retired Naval Officer with a hip replacement plus other metalic parts which set your machine off every time I go to the airport.

Cliff Woodrick - CDR USN (Ret)\"Sir;Unfortunately, access to your service record is not that easy to obtain for the screener on the floor. People who already scream that TSA is too intrusive would not be pleased with the idea that we could do some sort of computer background check on each passenger as they came up to our check point.As it stands now I am not aware of any technology in the TSA system that would allow us to make distinctions between passengers based upon some sort of bio-chip. And I very much doubt if congress would be willing to pay to install such a system. We have enough trouble getting them to cough up the money to buy equipment to replace what we wear out.We have no recourse but to treat all passengers as nearly the same as possible. Our SOP has provisions for persons with disabilities, and most airports have local procedures for implementing those provisions. Inform the screeners of your special needs when you arrive at the checkpoint; at most places we can adapt.Yes, I am aware that at some airports the screeners are not as polite or as patient as I would wish. I would ask that you please be patient with us. Most of us are doing the best we can.\nI have one question: why are we so paranoid as a country to have such ridiculous screening? What is the point of living in the country of the \"free\" with all these rights, when they really don't exist at all? I'm not saying that other countries don't have it rougher, but let's be realistic! Why do we give up so much for a little security? There is absolutely no privacy anymore... Packing my luggage has now become a \"process,\" just so I can make sure that I don't have anything in my carry on that would be deemed \"explosive!\" The days of overnighters with a carry on are practically gone... unless you're gonna buy a whole bunch of stuff on the other end. What has the world come to?\nAnonymous said... Hi.I had an umbrella confiscated by the TSA at the Portland (Oregon) Memorial Coliseum prior to a Barack Obama rallyI thought TSA = Transportation Security Administration. Why in the world is the TSA providing security for Barack? Does the Portland Coliseum have an airport, bus or train station? Providing security for anything other than transportation is CLEARLY NOT YOUR JOB.Who approached the TSA with this idea?Who authorized this outside work? Who paid for the TSA's time and equipment?I think this falls into the category of GROSS mismanagement, GROSS waste, and fraud.\nI have to fly almost weekly and the deal with the TSA is this... They are A JOKE. I went through a Check point chicky in Charlotte NC and had my buddies boarding pass and he had mine. It was a mistake.. But the TSA crackpot checked them thtoughly and then let us both through. I know that checking a boarding pass is bascailly a joke anyway but my issue with this is if you are going to put me through the hassle then do it right. I also want to address the issue of all of us complaining and REMEMBER 911. Here is the deal.. 911 would NEVER NEVER happen again and nothing that the TSA does will change that or not. Could someone sneak a bomb on a plane today I say YES. I am not sure how because I have no desire to but the bad guys are looking and will find a way if they so choose. The only thing that will stop them is the passangers on the plane. That is precisely the reason 911 would never happen again because the passangers would not let it happen and they have locked and renforced the cock pit doors and some piolets are armed. These are better than any TSA regulations. The TSA is there for the IMPRESSION of security and that is all! If you fools believe that the TSA or even your government is saving the world get a life please! I would like some basic common sense at the airports. I want my civil liberies back and I want the TSA is figure out they are not saving the world. And I am sure this will not get posted how is that for censorship!\nI am handicapped, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and have been treated like a criminal, a child, like I am stupid, and like a terrorists. This needs to stop. I know that I am not alone in this problem I have witnessed people with many different problems treated badly, humiliated and threatened.SIR, WE DO NOT CONSIDER ANYONE A CRIMINAL UNLESS THEY ARE ONE - CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT A TERRORIST LOOKS LIKE??...I THINK NOTI would also like to see the EXACT information that TSA agents are trained to especially in regards to dealing with the handicapped. Since every airport seems to follow different rules, at this point I am assuming that there are NO standard rules.YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION AS IT IS DEEMED SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITYHere are the two scenarios that I am interested in:1.) Handicapped person can not remove shoes and walk. The person alarms when walking through the detector..What happens now?YOU GO THORUGH THE SCREENING PROCESS (SIMPLY SAID)2.) Handicapped person can not remove shoes and walk. The person does not alarm when walking through the detector...What happens now?YOU GO THROUGH THE SCREENING PROCESS (SIMPLY SAID)I want to see the EXACT wording in the formal documentation that tells the TSA police what to do.AGAIN - SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION (YOU WILL NOT SEE IT)Thank you for your time and effort in clearing up my expectations when traveling the \"Friendly\" airways of my country.\nI find the TSA workers to be so inconsistent that I never know what is expected. In February I flew from SFO to Sydney, Australia-the TSA workers were very courteous and helpful. I am disabled and they were very nice about screening me and making sure that my belongings were in the control of my husband.I faced an entirely different kind of TSA worker in Honolulu flying home to SFO. The TSA woman was so very, very rude to me saying I needed to put all my electronics in a plastic bag-nothing was said about this when I left the country in February (14th). This worker yelled at me that I was being rude-she had me completely off balance and my boarding pass was in one of the plastic containers that had already gone through the xray machine. She yelled at me again and called me ignorant-I am disabled and this rude,aggressive woman was completely out of line. I was crying as she totally humiliated me and I feel that these people are not making us any safer. Some of them just get off telling people they have to do this and they have to do that. TSA you have made flying Hell!!! Get your act together and simplify your inconsistent rules and weed out the workers that are on an ego trip!!! There is no reason whatsoever that should give a government worker the right to harass an American citizen!!!\nTo speed up the xray process, why not post a sign at the conveyor that tells the people to PUSH there baggage onto the belt, instead of just standing there waiting for instructions wondering why the bags aren't moving. We should see at least a 20% improvement in processing. And speaking of improving the speed of the xrays, instruct the person sitting at the screen to stay focused on the job and not chit chat the the other Tsa employees whoile our bags are just sitting there or while we wait for the bags to come out the other end. Disney has monitors which explain how the process works, so consider a screen with a loop tape that tells newbie travelers how to proceed efficiently through the line.\nAs an honorably discharged,wartime veteran, as far as I'm concerned, the bad guys have already won. These infringements on my liberties and freedom to move around the country I defended are, imho, overboard.Along with the pre-approved, background cleared folks, how about including veterans. We defended this country, we're not out to blow something up.\nYou guys are even a bigger pain than I thought you were. Just getting to the point where I could post my comment was a royal pain.Trying again. As an honorably discharged, wartime vet, it's my humble opinion that your restrictions and scrutiny mean the bad guys have already won. When the restrictions begin interfering with the very freedoms and rights I fought to defend and complicate my everyday life, I have a problem with it.How about including active duty and veterans with honorable discharges in the quick lane?\nTo screener joe.See the note I just posted. I'm a vet., too, with part of a Huey in my leg that occasionally trips the buzzers. While it may be ethnic profiling, there really should be room for us in the mix.\nRe Signs in KC Airport - the sterile area is restricted to passengers and individuals with a need to conduct business in the sterile area (airport personnel, DEA personnel, secret service etc). Each individual must be able to demonstrate that they have a legitimate reason for being in this environment. Prior to submitting to screening, a flyer may elect not to show their ID...which is a voluntary decision, and voids your 4th amendment rights. The result of that decision is that the passenger will not be allowed to fly for two reasons;1. cannot verify that fraud is not taking place for the airline (is the person using the ticket who bought the ticket)...as nowadays, if IDs were not checked at the security checkpoint, one could;1. buy online2. check in online3. proceed through security4. board the aircraft ALL WITHOUT HAVING VERIFIED THEIR IDENTITY2. cannot verify that the individual has a legitimate need to be in the sterile area, pursuant to the changes that only allow flying passengers and those with a business need to be in the sterile area.\nAre you guys getting the message. Terrorists can not be stopped if they set their minds to it. Stop stepping on my freedoms. I just read the other blog postings, and that seems to be the general gist.Remember who's the bad guy. OK, can't get the airplane, let's just drive a truck where we want it. (Remember, that's how they started.) It's am intelligence issue, not an airport security issue. Let's knock off this overreaction!\nInconsistencies in Appproach ~The regulations loosely state that a Federal Security Director may, at his/her discretion exercise procedures that exceed the minimum requirements. TRANSLATED, this means that any airport can do as they please, and common sense doesn't always prevail. 1. SFO - \"please remove your hat when going through the screening process.\" What? No other airport requires this. Consider the impact on individuals who are going through chemotherapy etc and the potential embarrassment this may cause. Why this is a silly request...A. plastic explosives could be hidden in my hat. Answer - and they could be in my underwear too...or tied to my calf...or anywhere else. Result - dumb practice by SFO2. Las Vegas (good)...most other airports (bad) preparation of the passengers for the screening experience.Example: videos are continuously playing to show travelers what they need to do to be ready for screening...and even done with entertainment value (Elvis characters etc shown going through screening). Imagine how cool this could be for Burbank (Universal Studios or Disney), Orlando/John Wayne (Disney), Vail (skiers) etc...every airport could have unique individuals that are relevant to that geography. What the TSA may say...and my response:1. Space - not all screening checkpoints are created equal and some are very cramped. Answer - TRUE. However consider the impact of a screener saying (often yelling over-and-over) \"take off your shoes etc. NO ONE SOUNDS HELPFUL when yelling! * Signs only solve one part of the problem, as a wise friend of mine once said, 'the problem with signs is, you have to read them.' ** Thus video etc are clever and less abrasive ways to address this concern. 2. Cost is excessive. I have a difficult time understanding how this can be a valid answer, as associating 'cost benefit' is simply an exercise of moving funds from one general accounting line item to another...which isn't exactly a new financial practice for any business/organization.\nApparently All Plastic Bags are not Created Equal - True Story (JFK) -On day 1 of a 5 day road trip, I had the audacity to have my toiletries in a bag that was a \"quart sized bag.\" I was told I would have to either;a) throw all of these items away (and no, none of them exceeded 4 oz)b) find a smaller bagWhen I folded my 'quart sized bag' into quarters (yes, 1/4 the size), which is smaller than the TSA 'approved' size...I was still told that I needed a smaller bag. I simply asked \"why,\" as I was now transporting less than the approved amount. I didn't receive a real answer, other than a none too polite, \"you can't bring that through the checkpoint.\"As fortune and karma would have it, a nice woman next to me handed me a smaller bag (that was still larger than my folded one - yes I repeated myself)...so that I could fly that day without dumping my toiletries.\nTrusted Traveler Program (explain this please)~If one were to register, pay and be approved for this service, one is supposed to receive \"shorter lines and less stringent screening.\"To clarify what a screener must do, and my inability to understand the TSA's logic on how our experience will be enhanced;1. x-ray carry on bags (NO CHANGE)2. have electronic items removed from carry on bag (NO CHANGE)3. Resolve any alarms from the walk through metal detector (NO CHANGE)4. Randomly and consistently search carry on luggage (POSSIBLE CHANGE)5. Remove shoes (NO CHANGE)6. Resolve any suspicious or unidentifiable images in carry on bags - also known as the 'Screaming BAG CHECK' (NO CHANGE)7. Remove jackets and have them screened (NO CHANGE)So, if someone can actually explain the benefits from a 'security' standpoint, as the only benefit I see is from a practical standpoint of having a separate line to go through with less volume of passengers with the following impact;1. less screening space at that checkpoint for the remaining passengers (vast majority)\nTSA Screeners have a thankless job~The job the screeners do is extremely difficult with the limited tools they are provided...under often thankless conditions.Consider this;A. in the majority of airports the most 'private' space a screener can take a break, is usually a coffee shopB. often, when a supervisor needs to have a briefing with their team, they do it in a very public settingC. Being a screener is like being 'on stage' 8-10 hours per day...with every mis-step or frown being noticed D. Screeners are not empowered to effect change - how many times have you questioned a policy and gotten a 'good' answer? In LAS VEGAS, screeners are not required to yell over and over again for passengers to remove their electronics etc. In places like LAX where the screening checkpoints are bottlenecks, the pressure on screeners to move the line along means that they often don't actually stop the belt and examine every bag, as was once the mandatory practice (which was my experience in Austin, TX yesterday as well). * Note - an experienced x-ray operator can easily distinguish when a tub has nothing but a jacket and belt in it (for example), and having to stop the belt in that case is actually silly and somewhat of an insult to their experience and skill level; HOWEVER, when there are briefcases or electronics involved, it is alarming not to see the belt stopped. No one wants their bags checked...wants to take off their shoes and walk on dirty floors...to be treated like a security risk etc...yet these are the realities of the screening experience today. Maybe next time when traveling through the airport, we should all stop and ask ourselves, \"is it the screener making these rules, or Washington?\" Just maybe, we'll realize the screeners are just doing their job as instructed...and a letter to Washington is better than scorn for the screeners.\nCommunication Skills Start In Washington~Honest, clear and easy to understand communication can help the screeners work with the traveling public. One would suggest that an area for VAST IMPROVEMENT would be easily understandable communication strategies for the screeners to use when explaining a procedure. These explanations could be easily crafted in Washington and passed to screeners via their daily shift briefings. Examples of questions and TSA 'Suggested Answers' (some tongue in cheek): Question - \"Do I LOOK like a terrorist to you?\"Answer (tongue in cheek) - \"I don't know that I have ever seen a terrorist...so I don't know.\"Question - \"Why do I have to show my ID to get through security?\" Answer - \"One reason is to help the airlines make sure that the person buying the ticket is indeed using the ticket and the other is because by limiting the number of people who go through security to just those who need to...we HOPE to reduce lines for you!\"Question - \"Why do I have to throw out my food?\" Answer - \"Because the consistency of foods can be similar to known explosives. While we know it is terribly inconvenient, it is also our policy to err on the side of caution to try and help keep you safe when you travel.\"Question - \"Why do I have to take off my shoes?\"Answer - \"Experience has taught us that when terrorists try a tactic, they may try it again. There was once a attempted shoe bomber, so we want to make sure that never happens again.\"Question - \"How come I have to show my boarding pass AGAIN (to the screener working the walk through metal detector)?\"Answer - \"To double check ourselves, because good security requires back up checks.\"Just for fun...ask these same questions when you travel next and be prepared for poorly crafted answers...which usually start with the words...\"the rules say...\"\nChecking IDs - At some airports, I show my ID and boarding pass 3x...other times I show it 2x...and sometimes I show it 1x. Problem - I never know what to do with it. First - ID checker at the beginning of the security line Second - screener at walk through metal detectorThird - upon exiting the 'screening area'Suggestions~1. Ask the carriers to add a field in their data base to enable something like (PLEASE KEEP YOUR BOARDING PASS WITH YOU FOR SECURITY SCREENING) to be printed on the boarding pass - preferably near where the GATE # is printed/written2. Ensure coordination between screeners - as I left Austin I was told I didn't need my boarding pass again...only to be chastised for not having it at the walk through metal detector. The Rules - it used to be a carrier responsibility to ensure that ID/boarding passes were checked (and the carriers would employ the most cost effective solution to staffing that position that did not include their own personnel). This is why there was a disconnect between those companies and the TSA...as they didn't work together. NOW, we have the TSA doing it at significant cost...Next step...instead of simply replacing the prior employees with TSA screeners, look at how to consolidate that work in the actual screening process to eliminate duplication of effort and apply those screeners more effectively across the checkpoints.\nNeils Post~I agree with you...and offer this bit of information. The TSA is hoping to create a random environment that is difficult to predict for 'would be' bad guys. Everyone knows that the truly skilled bad guys are not fooled by these efforts; however there are others who we don't commonly think about...who are regular folks gone bad...who would do harm. Let's call them the Amateur Bad Guys. The TSA efforts are more akin to stopping these individuals. If one were to talk to the airport police about their day-to-day work day...one would be amazed by all the crazy stuff that they deal with; jilted boyfriend gone mad, failed marriages and ensuing behavior of those folks, people 'testing the system,' Amateur Bad Guys, drug dealers with controlled substances trying to transport them, drug/arms dealers transporting large sums of cash that show up on the x-ray as large blocks of organic material etc. Periodically there are even events that one would never suspect...like the time an airport employee climbed onto the ticket counter and began flapping his arms and crowing like a chicken...just basically losing it and need psychological evaluation. Or another time that an airport empoloyee was found scaling a fence (in uniform) before being apprehended...and was soon found to be mentally unstable and submitted for psychiatric care. All of this brings me to my point...which is that I agree with your assessment that anything that happens on an airplane now will be met by 50 passengers throwing laptops and every imaginable item while pummeling the individual stupid enough to try and take control of the aircraft. As the TSA continues to maintain the illusion of security to keep the Amateur Bad Guy from striking, let's hope that our government focuses on cargo and access to the sterile area by non-screened individuals.\nPlastic Bags for toiletries~Suggestion - Opportunity - Companies want advertisingOpportunity - TSA (airport authority) could generate revenue and a serviceHave the TSA (or airport authority) allow businesses to provide 'branded' plastic bags to consumers...Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Kayak/SideStep are just a few that are no brainers...OR, regional identities - * Microsoft for Seattle* Google for San Francisco* Disney for Orlando/Orange County* Ski resorts for Denver ...the list goes on and on!\nThank you for having this blog and for your willingness to post even extremely critical comments. I also appreciate that you sometimes respond to the comments. I hope this blog helps the TSA improve.\nquote: Trollkiller said... Anonymous said...

This has been common practice since at least the 2004 election. We have the training to conduct searches. While working these events we are following Secret Service directions. I would hardly call this practice waste or fraud. If we did not assist our brother agency, they would have to hire outside contractors. These would have to have some sort of background check and training. Instead, the government is being smart and efficient for a change by using its own employees that are already trained and vetted. The employees that do these events are working on their days off so security at the airport is not compromised.\nA very upset Anonymous person wrote:And he, along with a great many others, aren't going to be pleased with my answer, but at least I'm trying to give an answer.I would also like to see the EXACT information that TSA agents are trained to especially in regards to dealing with the handicapped. Since every airport seems to follow different rules, at this point I am assuming that there are NO standard rules.You're not going to get it, since I'm fairly certain that would be considered SSI information.However, your assumption would be incorrect. We do, in fact, have a Standard Operating Procedure. The differences between the airports, however, are brought from how any number of various supervisors and managers choose to execute those, and the fact that, while nobody can do less than the SOP requires, they can do moreExample?Shoes have to be removed when going through the walk-through metal detector (I understand there are a couple of exceptions to this, pilot programs and what-not, but that's the general rule). To do less, to not require this (again, in general), is against the regulations. To do more, however, and require that all shoes in a carry-on be removed and x-rayed seperately? I can only imagine that being inconvenient as hell, but it would, technically, be permissable.I want to see the EXACT wording in the formal documentation that tells the TSA police what to do.We're not police, and you're not going to get it. Again, all of that information is considered to be SSI, and cannot be released by any except the.. oh.. I think it is the TSA Administrator himself/herself.Here are the two scenarios that I am interested in:1.) Handicapped person can not remove shoes and walk. The person alarms when walking through the detector..What happens now?2.) Handicapped person can not remove shoes and walk. The person does not alarm when walking through the detector...What happens now?Again, I can't give you the exact wording that you want, but I can tell you, in the scope of those scenarios, what is required:1. The passenger must be sent for secondary screening, and since they alarmed will require a hand-held metal detector screening, followed by a pat-down at the end. The shoes themselves will be tested and screened while remaining on the passenger's feet.(though it behooves the passenger to [while remaining civil, please; civility helps passengers so much] inform the screener that they cannot remove their shoes)2. The passenger will be sent for secondary screening, though since he passed the WWMD without alarming, all that must be screened is his footwear, and in the same method of scenario #1.Now, bear in mind, that's the baseline on what would be absolutely required. Any airport is able to go above and beyond the scope of what is deemed to be minimum - if one of the Powers That Be decided that anyone and everyone being referred for secondary screening had to undergo an HHMD screening, then they would be within their rights to do just that, and the absolute minimum doesn't apply - they're not doing less, they're doing more.I know you're not going to be satisfied with this answer, but it is the best that I personally can give.\n\"I want to see the EXACT wording in the formal documentation that tells the TSA police what to do.\"I must say that you will almost certainly not be allowed to see the \"exact wording.\" Please, let me explain.Whether we like it or not, there are \"bad guys\" out there who do intend harm to the U.S. and its citizens. There have been incidents in Europe. There have been plots broken and people arrested both in Europe and in the U.S. They are out there. As a screener, I would like to believe that my work is helping to keep you safe.The mission of TSA is to make it as difficult as possible for the bad guys to act. To that end a certain amount of randomness is deliberately built into our procedures. And we are modifying and changing our procedures as we are made aware of new or different threats. Most of these changes never reach the publics attention.Any information that the bad guys can gain about our procedures and techniques could weaken our systems. If they know what we do and how we do it, they know what they need to avoid. We don't want them to have that advantage. So, we do not allow the public to have access to our SOP.There is an implication in your post, and others like it, that just because you have a disability, you cannot be dangerous. Well, just last fall, a person with a disability smuggled a hand gun into a prison by hiding it in a wheelchair. Nor is that a new idea. Thirty years ago in a newspaper comic strip, I remember a story line in which a person used a disability to smuggle a hand gun onto a airplane in order to commit an act of air piracy.Screening is very uncomfortable for the passenger with disabilities. It is also uncomfortable for the screener. Good screeners understand how intrusive it is. For that reason it is part of our refresher training program and our annual competency testing.I suppose this is not the answer you were hoping for, but I hope it at least help clear up some of the confusion.\nScreener Joe... I was not in any way satisfied with your dismissive response to the retired Naval Officer who has disabilities and trouble getting through screening:\"... I very much doubt if congress would be willing to pay to install such a system. We have enough trouble getting them to cough up the money to buy equipment to replace what we wear out.We have no recourse but to treat all passengers as nearly the same as possible. Our SOP has provisions for persons with disabilities, and most airports have local procedures for implementing those provisions. Inform the screeners of your special needs when you arrive at the checkpoint; at most places we can adapt.Yes, I am aware that at some airports the screeners are not as polite or as patient as I would wish. I would ask that you please be patient with us. Most of us are doing the best we can.March 21, 2008 5:39 PM1. If TSA were particularly adept at managing its budgets (it is not, see the 2007 GAO report that excoriates TSA for its uncertain budgeting practices for example in the way it maintains its screening machines, its high turnover rate -- very costly, and its general mismanagement overall -- \"Heckuva Job, Kip\")2. Your SOP has provisions for dealing with people with disabilities that include forcing people who can't walk to walk, people who can't remove their shoes to remove their shoes, not providing places for these people to put their shoes on again once they've managed to get through the process, and you're telling me that they will vary from place to place? This sounds like a blatant violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. How is it that you haven't been sued yet? Or is immunity from such suits written into your charter (I admit that I haven't had the bandwidth yet to see if that got written into your enabling act)?3. You ask that we, the traveling public be patient with you? No dice. How about you, the government who serves the traveling public, actually serve the traveling public -- especially those who have given so much for this country. We as a people have been patient enough with the lies and obfuscations of the TSA, and every other government intrusion into our lives that has been brought on in the name of \"homeland security\" since 9/11 to save us from the \"terrists\" and the other assorted non-christian brown people from overseas. It's time for the government to show us some results.\nMost unfortunately, the TSA makes it extremely difficult for the disabled traveler to know that he/she has every right to refuse to remove his/her shoes. All one needs to do is to state to a screener something to effect of \"I have a medical condition and cannot remove my shoes.\" The screener may not ask the traveler any questions about that condition.Those stations that force everyone to remove shoes need to be instructed in the ADA. It is a disgrace to the TSA to force the elderly and infirm (as well as infants) to remove their shoes.I have seen old people in wheelchairs made to get up out of their chairs and walk, shuffle, through the WTMD. That, too, is a disgrace to your agency.The rules need to change.The AARP, the American Diabetes Association, elder care centers, gerontologists, etc. all need begin to instruct their members/clients/patients to refuse to remove their shoes when transiting a checkpoint.\nWhy aren't TSA staff levels matched to the airlines schedules and capacity levels? Why must there be waits of over an hour at large airports (Atlanta, Chicago, etc)? This would take planning and monitoring based on reservations and the actual schedule. McDonalds, grocery stores, Wal-Mart and others can adjust to the ebbs and flows of volume. Why can't TSA at large airports?\nScreener Joe... You make me want to tear what's left of my hair out:Whether we like it or not, there are \"bad guys\" out there who do intend harm to the U.S. and its citizens. There have been incidents in Europe. There have been plots broken and people arrested both in Europe and in the U.S. They are out there. As a screener, I would like to believe that my work is helping to keep you safe.How many times do we have to go over this? The TSA has not been responsible for finding so many as one of these so called \"plots\" or foiling so many as one of these would be \"terrorists\". Plain old fashioned intelligence and police work has been the key to this. You would like to think that you're keeping us safe, but you're not. You're just keeping people afraid in a very visible way. Keep screening cargo -- or keep moving toward screening cargo (uh, how is it that we have to wait til 2010 when the threat is so omenous?????). Keep screening checked baggage (subject to the many good ideas that people have submitted for keeping the theft problem in check on other parts of the blog) and take the checkpoint security back to what it was pre-9/11. Remember, it wasn't the fact that the guys had the boxcutters that made them able to take over the planes -- it was the fact that they were able to get into the cockpits. We got that covered now.Don't p*** on my shoes and tell me it's raining Joe. I ain't buying it, and fortunately, it looks as if a great number of others aren't either.\nairport screening is just one example of our society's total over reaction/paranoic collective conciousness. While 9/11 was a horrific event - to put it in perspective: blow up one 747 jet every 10 minutes and that is the rate of how many children under the age of 5 are dying every 10 minutes!!! In the meantime, the terrorists are laughing hysterically and are totally energized by our society's collective psychosis. Does anyone honestly think a plane can by highjacked in this day and age? At least 25% (a guess) of the passengers would be attacking the terrorists...aka...pennsylvania plan heroes on 9/11\nTSA does not like screening the disabled and as such want to make the process so disagreable that the disabled will cease flying. Might be time to call TSA about discrimination. Might be time to get the AARP involved as well.\nScreening is very uncomfortable for the passenger with disabilities.Yes, and TSA makes it even more uncomfortable for the disabled/elderly to fly.It is also uncomfortable for the screener.Part of doing your job so shut up and stop whining about that part of it.Good screeners understand how intrusive it is. For that reason it is part of our refresher training program and our annual competency testing.Make it so uncomfortable for the disabled that they stop flying and you've won. You won't have to deal with them anymore. You will, though have to deal with their letter writing campaigns.\nYes, I am aware that at some airports the screeners are not as polite or as patient as I would wish. I would ask that you please be patient with us. Most of us are doing the best we can.You're making your problem our problem. Since when should the traveling public be forced to deal with your inability to properly do your job? What if one of your close relatives was subjected to the torture your coworkers regularly subject other disabled people to? Would you tell them that the screener had a bad day and to just put up with a screening process? What would you do yourself?\nwhat's equally disturbing to me is how many people (including me) are reluctant/afraid to post their names. We are choosing anonymous. Even though we have code linking to us, we are \"afraid\" other people may deem us unpatriotic with potential repercussions. Total paranoid society is developing/has developed.\nConsider this;A. in the majority of airports the most 'private' space a screener can take a break, is usually a coffee shopB. often, when a supervisor needs to have a briefing with their team, they do it in a very public settingC. Being a screener is like being 'on stage' 8-10 hours per day...with every mis-step or frown being noticed D.

If you don't like your job then find another (sort of like TSOs who've said \"if you don't like the screening process then find a different way to travel.\")\nDoes anyone honestly think a plane can by highjacked in this day and age? At least 25% (a guess) of the passengers would be attacking the terrorists...aka...pennsylvania plan heroes on 9/11Terrorist: Remain calm. This plane is being hijacked.Passengers: WTF?Lots of noise and some screams from the hijacker.Passengers: He's pretty much stopped moving. You don't have to stomp on him anymore. No, really, his hands are crushed. Passengers: Just one more kick to the head for inconviencing us?\nI love the phrase \"I ain't buying it\", don't p*** on my shoes and say its raining. thats just gold\nParagraph breaks are mine. BGR TSO said...The TSA officers in question were on loan to the Secret Service. This has been common practice since at least the 2004 election. We have the training to conduct searches. While working these events we are following Secret Service directions. I would hardly call this practice waste or fraud. If we did not assist our brother agency, they would have to hire outside contractors. These would have to have some sort of background check and training.Instead, the government is being smart and efficient for a change by using its own employees that are already trained and vetted. The employees that do these events are working on their days off so security at the airport is not compromised.Sorry I am not buying the \"outside contractor, background check\" argument. If the Obama rally was a \"one of\" event I would support your \"loaner TSO\" plan. The fact is TSOs are being used at rally after rally. According to you TSOs have been loaned out since 2004.Do you really think it is more efficient to use a security team that is unfamiliar with the venue, unfamiliar with Secret Service protocol and changes day to day and venue to venue?Don't you think a more efficient use of resources would be hiring a contract security company, assuming the Secret Service does not have enough of their own people, to screen at Obama rallies day after day? The use of TSO instead of professional contract security brings up a few questions.What budget do the loaner TSOs get paid from? TSA, Treasury Dept., or Obama's campaign?What law or rule allows for the loaning of TSOs? (Just a general answer here is good. No need to make Francine look up all the case law on a Easter weekend)Who paid for the moving and setting up the equipment?Are TSOs allowed to take other off duty security jobs and wear their TSA issued uniform?If a TSO makes rude comment or steals, what department takes the complaint? TSA or Secret Service?The TRANSPORTATION Security Agency needs to stick with transportation security until they can do that right on a consistent basis. If the TSA wants to be the Wal~Mart for all the Govt. screening needs, they need to change the name. How about \"The Screening Agency\", that way you don't have to change the monogram on the Kip's towels.\nOrlando Airport. Friday 10 AM. Tried to report an unattended bag to Burger King staff since it was at their table counter. Nobody cared. Walked to the nearest gate. They told me to use the courtesy phone. TSA isn't an option. Lost and found is. They said they dont have the manpower to go all over the airport and pick up bags. (this was all recorded on the phone call). Why play \"report all unattended bags using the courtesy phone\" when you cant actually do it?\nAnonymous said... Consider this; A. in the majority of airports the most 'private' space a screener can take a break, is usually a coffee shop B. often, when a supervisor needs to have a briefing with their team, they do it in a very public setting C. Being a screener is like being 'on stage' 8-10 hours per day...with every mis-step or frown being noticed D. Screeners are not empowered to effect change - how many times have you questioned a policy and gotten a 'good' answer?***************** None of those issues are the traveling public's responsibility. If you don't like your job then find another (sort of like TSOs who've said \"if you don't like the screening process then find a different way to travel.\") I disagree, ALL those issues are the traveling public's (read American citizens) responsibility. The TSA works FOR us. They are OUR employees.If we allow poorly trained employees, improper procedures, bad management, or poor working conditions to continue because we take the \"too bad so sad\" attitude, we will get what we deserve.We are the bosses of our Government. It answers to us, not the other way around. EVERY government employee from the President down to the janitor answers to us, but we must demand answers and not rest until we get them.\n\"YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION AS IT IS DEEMED SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.\"Standard operating procedure is now considered SSI? I smell a rat. Why would someone need a security clearance (which, by the way, I have. Are CAC readers so expensive you can't put just one in every airport?) to find out whether or not they need to remove their shoes, and what their basic rights are?Someone later on said something to the effect of \"you void your 4th Amendment rights when you travel without photo ID\". Though the TSA, through executive charter (which has not yet been reviewed by a judicial body - I'll give it a couple years maximum before it's completely overturned), has \"voided\" 4th Amendment rights in the first place (who needs probable cause, anyway?), there is no case law or precedent for \"no ID = no 4th\". In fact, I believe that there's been at least one case that has decided that NOT showing ID is in fact an exercise of one's 4th Amendment rights - which is why the TSA can't require photo ID for domestic flights.Your agency needs to have clearly documented and implemented procedures for every single one of your employees and contractors to follow. There are 43,000 of you total, according to your website. There are three million active and reserve members of the United States military, and we do a much harder job than you much more efficiently. I know you've only been a real government agency for a little under six years, but it's time to pull it together. You often state that \"lives are at stake\" - please act like it.\nI've been reading this blog for a month or so, and what strikes me is that the TSOs who post don't understand that they'll never get the trust they want until the TSA changes its approach. Uneven enforcement of rules and refusal to standardize and disclose requirements has created in the minds of many Americans the impression that the TSA is either corrupt or incompetent. Neither impression inclines Americans to be particularly cooperative or sympathetic, as reflected in the comments here.Terrorists seek to disrupt the normal functioning of society through the use of violence, and I'd say that the TSA is proof that OBL and his gang have succeeded nicely. Personally, I preferred this country when it was less safe and less fearful.\nEVERY government employee from the President down to the janitor answers to us, but we must demand answers and not rest until we get them.Want to fly today? Want us to call a LEO over to have you arrested? Go over there for additional screening.Neither the President nor the janitor can have us summarily either detained or arrested. On the other hand a TSO who has a burr under his saddle can do all of those things plus some. They are an agency running open loop and answer to no one, especially the unwashed masses who fly.\nwinstonsmith said: \"The TSA has not been responsible for finding so many as one of these so called \"plots\" or foiling so many as one of these would be \"terrorists\".\"Do I understand your opinion correctly: you are saying that since we can't prove we're perfect we should quit trying?

What you don't get is that you can't claim that you are keeping us safe from plots such as the London bomb plot or any other plot that never actually makes it to a TSA checkpoint. You and other TSOs seem to like to support yourselves by saying that \"they're out there and we're catching them.\" Well, \"they're\" out there, and actual police and genuine investigatory agencies are catching them while you good people at the TSA are busiliy treating innocent travelers as if they were criminals. Not only can't you prove you are perfect Joe, you can't even prove you're effective. So yes, quit. Please. Take checkpoint security back to what it was pre 9/11 and leave the cockpit doors bolted. We'd all be better off for it.TSA is not supposed to \"catch\" terrorists as you seem to challange us to do.That's your \"challenged\" interpretation of what I said. I never used any such language. What you are supposed to do as an agency is to keep guns, large knives, and actual explosives off of planes, a job that was done just as well if not better by the private security companies pre-9/11 as you do today and without all the needless and wholesale violation of people's rights and sensibilities.We are supposed to create a barrior between the terrorist and the passengers on that airplane. Our job is to make it difficult enough for the bad guy that he does not make the attempt.And your own agency's audits, as well as audits by the GAO in 2003, and 2006 have shown that your efforts are largely ineffective in keeping dangerous items from going through the checkpoints (in addition to numerous anecdotal items that appear right here on this very blog about missed items that passengers were surprised made it through). So why are you still on the job?I cannot prove that the work of the TSA has dissuaded anyone from trying to attack a plane. You cannot prove that we haven't.March 22, 2008 9:53 PMJoe, it is not up to me to prove anything. Your agency is making the extraordinary claim to be providing us incremental safety, therefore it is up to the TSA to provide the extraordinary evidence to support the claim. I make no claims, but I do point out the demonstrable facts that you as an agency aren't doing anything any better than we had before, but at a much greater cost to the flying public, to the airlines, and to the rights and civil liberties of all people who fly in the United States. The burden of proof is on the TSA and on the government in general to prove that its extraordinary measures have yielded extraordinary results, not on the flying public to prove that governmental claims of \"trust me\" are all wet.What's that I smell?... oh that's right, you are still telling me it's raining and my shoes are wet yet there's not a cloud in the sky. No sale Joe.\nAnonymous said...Want to fly today? Want us to call a LEO over to have you arrested?

On the other hand a TSO who has a burr under his saddle can do all of those things plus some.

You are right, at this point the TSA is running in an open loop. It is up to us, to close that loop.I encourage you, do not bow down to threats. Stand up. Refuse shoddy treatment from TSOs. Stand on every one of your Federal Constitutional rights and your State Constitutional rights.\nI'm sure the TSA has noticed since they initiated these blogs the repition of how passengers report how they are treated or mis-treated. Despite that the TSA has never officially addressed these complaints. Sure the TSA bloggers have at different times and in different tomes replied to some of those complaints but never a blog decicated to treatment of passengers. Yes there has been a blog on liquid, a blog on the legal foundations of TSA, how the TSA searches bags, etc, etc. But nothing on the basic most common gripes posted here. I find it even more surprising that the TSA Mission, Vision and Core Values does not address this most fundamental aspect. MissionThe Transportation Security Administration protects the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.VisionThe Transportation Security Administration will continuously set the standard for excellence in transportation security through its people, processes, and technology.Core ValuesTo enhance mission performance and achieve our shared goals, we are committed to promoting a culture founded on these values:Integrity: We are a people of integrity who respect and care for others.

We are a people who will build teams around our strengths.\nScreener Joe - You said:\"I cannot prove that the work of the TSA has dissuaded anyone from trying to attack a plane. You cannot prove that we haven't.\"The TSA can do better than that. Of all the passengers that have been arrested due to suspicious behavior or fraudulent travel documents, or had firearms found at checkpoints, or artfully concealed prohibited items found at checkpoints, or were involved in a checkpoint closure, terminal evacuation or sterile area breach, or were disruptive on flights, how many actually were involved in a terrorist group or plot?Certainly all of this above issues were further investigated by TSA or LEO. How many were involving a person with terrorist intentions? Any? If some were just \"testing\" the system certainly the TSA or LEO would have investigated their backgrounds and affiliations. In that case how many were found to have connections to known terrorist organizations?All of the items that were used in the 9-11 hijackings were allowed, then and now, to be brought on a plane. So what is different? The principal difference is that passengers today, like those on United 93 and American 63, will rise-up and defend to the death, any threat to the safety of the aircraft and fellow passengers.It would be totally impossible for an aircraft to be hijacked today and used as a weapon.\nSorry I made one mistake in my previous post. One of the items reportedly used during the 9-11 hijackings were box cutters that were allowed then but are currently not allowed. However one item allowed today, and then, are scissors less than 4\" in length. As everyone knows a scissor blade less than 4\" length is still greater than the length of the exposed blade in a box cutter.\ni would like to just post a grin and a gripe at the same time...just got home from RSW in FL (Fort Myers)and here is what happened, got to the airport at 430 for a 730 flight (ok, early) checked into Delta, and bags checked in too, and then got boarding passes and then went through security, no problem, fast, the agents were nice etc. go through security, FLIGHT CANCELED... have to go back to delta counter (outside security) and have them book us on a continental flight to NEWARK instead of LGA... then new boarding passes, and into security again and surprise surprise, pulled over for random check cause we had left, got new boarding passes and all...ok, the agent who checked my things was really nice, so i am happy about that as were the female agent who did my sisters things and the other male agent who handled my dads. we got our boarding passes stamped cleared by TSA and the date. went to the gate and then when the 630 (full flight) NEWARK left, we asked if we could get seats together, ok, the ticket agents at the desk for CONTINENTAL were happy to change our seats, but took our freshly stamped TSA CLEARED boarding passes and didnt return them...gripe- went to board the 830 flight to NEWARK already 15 min late, a alarm went off when the new agents checked the boarding passes- hmm we were supposed to be checked by TSA and werent, so we have to be again... telling the agent for continental- ummm we were checked, look it up- they said they had to have a TSA agent come and check us again- is it possible to maybe get a computer system where- TSA agents can input the passengers name on a list, with the airline too, so the airline can pull it up, if a seat change has occurred or if, the alarm goes off?grin- two TSA agents came over, and the female one had already checked us, and was like, you again, and told the flight agents that we were clear and stamped us and sent us on our way... whew!!!! that is awesome, and thank u TSA for that!\nA couple of recent experienceshave left me deeply troubled about the state of the TSA and airport security in general.In October of 2007, I was returning to Honolulu from Miami International. In the security line, I showed the TSA attendant my photo ID (a Hawai'i driver's licence) and my boarding pass. He told me that my ID was not valid and that I needed a passport. After a moment of stunned silence, I asked why it was valid enough for me to get to Miami but not for the return trip. He once again said that I would need a passport. I then asked him if he realized that Hawai'i was a part of the U.S., at which point he said that he'd \"let me go this time\" but that in the future, I should have a passport as a valid ID.On another trip between Honolulu and Hilo in December of 2007, my wife and three daughters (ages 4,2,and 9 months at the time) as well as myself were singled out for extra screening. All of us, including my infant, were patted down and thoroughly inspected. I have absolutely no problem being inspected, and I realize there are issues with profiling, but there seems to be a disconnect with reality on the part of many of the screeners. Of the more than 100 passengers on that flight, a couple with 3 young children are singled out for extra screening? Gimme a break!\nLowlights~LowLight 1.~Screener Joe...being curt in your response to the individual with a physical hardship, when they simply asked how they would be handled. Just like the checkpoint...unhelpful at times. * HOW ABOUT THIS - anyone who alarms the WTMD will need to have the source of the alarm identified. If that means taking a sterile piece of cloth and 'tracing' their shoes etc...then that's what will happen. DID THIS JUST VIOLATE SSI...nope...common sense Screener Joe. LowLight 2.~ NO VOTING BUTTONS on TSA posts. You would have an immediate feedback mechanism that tells you how your answers/statements are being received. MAYBE this preponderance of evidence/response would be enough to wake some folks up to how things are being done?LowLight 3.~LACKING FACTUAL STATEMENTS - 1) Testing - has anyone bothered to see the results of the Red Team Testing? WATERED DOWN EXPLANATION - (Red Team Testing) - a bunch of folks from Washington DC hit each checkpoint simultaneously with tests that are meant to measure screening effectiveness. Once the first test is registered, a call goes out to the other checkpoints to be on the alert to testing. Despite this...the results are no better than when private screening companies were working the checkpoints. IS IT THE TRAINING? (IMO) - the TSA screeners receive 5x more initial training than the private screeners before them. TSA screeners receive recurrent training that eclipses what private screening companies were budgeted for...yet the results are the same. COULD IT BE THE EQUIPMENT? - the x-ray equipment etc that is used to screen for IEDs etc are inadequate. If one understands how the machines actually function technically, the ability to thwart them is even easier. WHAT THE ISRAELIS DO DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO - they do through review of boarding passengers (profiling or what the TSA now calls 'behavior officers' or something akin to that). After all...one could have a 10 lb bomb on an airplane...and unless that person had ill intent...the plane is safe. THE LESSON HERE - it is not 'what' is on the airplane...it is 'who' (with the exception of explosives in cargo).OH, and before we have to read another politely structured statement from the TSA about testing effectiveness...can some writer for some paper use FOIA and get the results, as it is shocking. LASTLY...the comments I posted earlier on these points (copied at the bottom) are meant to highlight that Washington is letting down their own people. When the TSA rolled out, the screeners were promised break rooms, lockers, internet access to be able to manage their payroll accounts, proper anti fatigue mats etc...of which the screeners received none of those things. SCHEDULING...WASTED RESOURCES...how many airports are still using excel by a 'Scheduling Manager' who has no way of tying the passenger loads of the airlines into their manpower forecasts? How ridiculous is that...to be unable to 'forecast' the passenger load when every airline knows their loads in advance? THE IMPACT - 1. tax payer money being thrown away by inefficient practices2. Screener Morale is impacted - consider the impact on the screener who asked for a day off...and is told 'no' only to find a half empty checkpoint because the TSA can't forecast passenger loads. 3. Higher burnout and turnover4. Long lines and not enough resources to handle them or too many screeners manning empty checkpoints (back to point #1)If the TSA was less like a government organization and more like a business, these practices would have been fixed out of necessity. Wasteful practices abound... It makes me sad to see a screener have to sit in a gate area to take their break and eat something. It makes me sad when a screener can't have a moment of privacy to call family or loved ones during a break. It makes me sad that the way the screeners have been let down by Washington has caused some to feel like their behavior to the public is OK...like being rude or impatient or unwilling to explain is somehow forgiven...because of what they were promised and didn't receive. Consider this;A. in the majority of airports the most 'private' space a screener can take a break, is usually a coffee shopB. often, when a supervisor needs to have a briefing with their team, they do it in a very public settingC. Being a screener is like being 'on stage' 8-10 hours per day...with every mis-step or frown being noticedD.

It is called General Aviation, you are treated with respect, and you will wonder why there even is a TSA.\n\"Please fill the trunk of your car with food, drinks, and condiments and drive to your destination!Don't forget your GAS card!\"Well you pretty much sum up what is the worst attitude a TSO could possibly have. Do you hate your job? Do you think that abusing the public is a right that comes with your TSA uniform?

Please don't stop at the Albany FSD. If you indeed believe a crime was committed, contact the local police and file charges. TSA needs to learn that government is \"for the people\" - and not against them. Maybe if screeners realized that they may have to explain their actions in a court of law, some of this would stop.\nAt the Kalispell, Montana airport, they did not open the security check line till less than half an hour before flight time. We joined the line in plenty of time, but were at the end. The plane took off before we got through the line. We surmise that the contractors maximized their profit by minimizing the time the line was open.\nAnonymous said... \"Please fill the trunk of your car with food, drinks, and condiments and drive to your destination!Don't forget your GAS card!\"Why do you automatically assume that this was a TSO?It could just as easily not been a TSO who made this post.If it was a TSO, Shame on you, Quit and go to work at a fast food joint!If it was not a TSO, this shows the abuse that TSO's have to deal with when everyone assume it was a TSO making that statement.P.S. Naysayers, (especially winstonsmith) Please consider the following: What if the terrorist plot is to blow up the plane in the sky over a major American city and not a repeat of 9-11? Does this change the equation for you?Well, does it?\nThe traveling public is comprised of many travelers today that are ignorant to the fact that the world we live in today is not all \"PEACHY\" and well. I do agree that PEANUT BUTTER nor STRAWBERRY JAM can destroy you. But why make the job harder for TSA or TSO's from doing their job? Because you want to make a point that your hungry and that PEANUT BUTTER won't blow up? If the Dept Of the NAVY would allow me to again volunteer to go overseas and take someone with me to show them what kind of people there are out there. And what they are capable of, I would gladly do so. But in the meantime enjoy your peanut butter and Jelly sandwitch because I will continue to do my job and discard it.\nI do not understand the TSA policy by which my identification card/passport and boarding pass is checked by a TSA officer at the head of the line, and then the boarding pass has to be checked 10 feet away as I pass through the metal detector. Why can't the first check enough - there is no place for anyone to go or for anyone to join the queue.\nFigure this one. I have a TSA approved lock (i.e., one for which the TSA has a key) for my suitcase, although I usually carry on. On one flight recently, however, I checked my bag .. but forgot to lock the suitcase. Thus, the lock was attached and secured, but not preventing the suitcase from being opened. When the bag arrived, the lock was removed, gone. Only a TSA person could have removed the lock.\nMy husband and I are travelers in our 70's. We are so fed up with long lines, humiliating searches and inconvenience that we now skip flying entirely and take Amtrak whenever possible. Good food, nice seats, great scenery. We need more trains!\nMichael wrote:In October of 2007, I was returning to Honolulu from Miami International. ...He told me that my ID was not valid and that I needed a passport. ...I should have a passport as a valid ID.Oh.. my..

Gimme a break!Yeeeeeah... about that...See, the airline does this thing called selectee designation, which, so I understand, is done through a computer system known as CAPPS - Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening. While the ins and outs of this system are above my pay-grade, and are probably SSI, I can tell you that the reasons for being so selected number into the small thousands. Everything from a flight being cancelled and being rebooked on a different airline (as far as the computer is concerned, you just walked up to the counter and got the ticket) all the way down to good, old-fashioned random selection.It's one of the more common questions I've been asked over the course of the past six years - \"Why was I selected?\" - and that's the best I can tell them. I really, really don't know all of the things the airline associates with designating people as selectees; I only know that we have to screen them.And there's not a choice in it for us. One time, an entire flight of 12-year old girls flying home to China after a week in Space Camp got designated as selectees, and the only option we, as the TSA, had was to screen them and perform the bag searches on all of their carry-ons.And, on a final note, the way an airline designates people as selectees is not the much-maligned no-fly list nor even the \"terrorist watch list\" - it's something seperate from the two of those. It's more like a coding requirement in computers.If (this) is (that[+the other]) then (X), else (Y).\nThe TSA does not make me feel safe at all. I was travelling on business out of BWI and when I was in the line to go through security, the \"child\" that was screening the bags had his head turned away from the screen and was having a conversation with his girlfriends. What is the point of screening bags when noone is watching?\nAnonymous said: All of the items that were used in the 9-11 hijackings were allowed, then and now, to be brought on a plane. So what is different? The principal difference is that passengers today, like those on United 93 and American 63, will rise-up and defend to the death, any threat to the safety of the aircraft and fellow passengers.This statement is entirely untrue. The items used in the hijackings on 911 are not permitted items any number of them or even all of them being caught by xray would have taken the tools used out of the hijackers hands. This includes the boxcutters, playdough/clay used in the fake bombs to control the passengers, and knives. Also those hijackers would be on no-fly lists as known terrorists and stopped while trying to purchase tickets. If they managed to get tickets a ticketchecker or BDO most likely would have picked up the very obvious signals and body language and sent them for extra screening. One or any number of these scenarios should have prevented 911 and the great loss of life.I have just mentioned the things the TSA does to prevent another 911. I'm not talking about the cockpit doors, the passengers being aware and willing to stop hijackings as that has also changed post 911. TSA screeners\nI would like to see what would happen if the tsa stopped working for 1 week. I assure you that after 20 plus firearms, god only knows how many knives, and maybe even an ied or two, gets onto an airplane then youll be a little less likely to complain about losing your 2 dollar toothpaste.\nIn regards to the comments about the retired naval officer with the hip replacement, there is nothing in our policies at TSA that says that all passengers must remove their shoes, no exceptions. If a passenger states for any medical reason they are unable to remove their shoes then we are to do additional screening on the shoes and allow them to leave them on. No passenger can be forced to do anthing, we can only make suggestions. I am under the understanding that the whole screening process is done through passengers decisions. And to the people making the comments that the passenger should take a bus or train, that is not what TSA is about. Security may be number one priority but customer service follows close behind that and as a TSA officer it is our job to work with person's with disabilities and medical requests.\nI have no idea who some of these TSO's are, responding to some of these \"Anonymous\"idiots who post here.But as far as I am concerned, my greatest fear is that someone will walk in amongst people waiting in line and detonate a IED! The second fear I have is that I miss a IED that goes on a plane and blows up not only killing the \"Anonymous\" TSO haters here but those beautiful people who I swore to protect.Here is a few facts...first of all the late flights, the cancelled flights, the over booked flights are attributed to the Airlines and not the TSA. Our job is to do our best to protect you according guidlines set by the Department of Homeland Security.....Long Lines? One of the problems we have is that passengers do not understand or follow the instructions for the screening process. THE LESS ON BOARD BAGGAGE THE BETTER. Follow the 311 rule. If you pack a bag full of electronics and wires, its going to be search. Do you know what a detonator looks like? I do, but when you insist on bringing a bag on board with items that you won't need on the flight, there will be bag searches.Do you know what the latest intel is on IEDs being made to blow up a plane? We do and you won't be happy to know what they are doing. Someone say Peanut Butter earlier? We go to class and learn everyday. We are tested on our job knowledge and capabilities on a daily basis constantly. I am extremely cordial with passengers and go out of my way to greet the passenger, smile at the passenger, give helpful hints to the passenger, and wish them a great day and a happy flight, no matter what duty station I'm on. If you have a situation with a TSO, talk to the STSO and a Complaint form will be filled out. It will be submitted for review.This week I received three written compliments which made me very appreciable. Have you ever tried either one?In closing I see some legit complaints and I see others that are so off base it is pathetic. I thank you very much and if I can be of further service, let me know and folks, you have a great day!!!!\nI would like to post a complaint. Last week after picking up my checked bag, and getting to my car in long term parking, noticed that the TSA lock on my bag wasn't mine. Had to drive to the terminal, lug the suitcase into the counter, then was told to go to security, where they had to try 5 different keys to get the lock off my bag. Thank goodness they only switched the locks, my clothes were still in my suitcase. Don't think I'll bother buying another TSA lock...\nPatting down a child is disgraceful. Patting down a 9-month old is beyond belief.It's my suggestion that all parents teach their kids to scream for help if someone from the TSA touches them. They would just be putting into practice what hopefully they are already being taught - that you never let a stranger touch you and if someone does that, you scream.\nOn a direct flight from Memphis to Detroit, jewelry was stolen from my suitcase. The jewelry was packed inside of a box, which was packed inside of a zipped up bagged. The jewelry were the only items taken, and no card was left to indicate that my luggage had been searched. I know that my suitcase had been tampered with, because the zippers were in a different location than where I put them. The only time my suitcase was out of my possession was when I turned it in to the TSA people at the airport in Memphis. The only way someone could have known that the jewelry was there was via Xray. My claims with TSA and the airlines were denied. Now, you tell me - who could have pulled off this theft? It MUST have involved a TSA employee, perhaps in cahoots with someone from the airlines. In any case, DON'T TRUST ANYONE with TSA. They're human beings and not all of them are honest!\nAs one with a replacement knee, I am set aside for \"special\" treatment. Some TSA employees follow the necessary procedures pleasantly; others go far beyond the minimum procedures.For example, I have been asked to empty my pockets completely, even of items such as handkerchiefs and dollar bills that are clearly non-metallic. In one instance, my wallet was taken to be put through the detector, and was left unattended in plain sight for anyone to steal.\nI flew from Detroit to Amsterdam in early March. I normally carry a fair amount of tech toys; I get pulled over about half the time, which is understandable. However, this time the TSA official explained I had to remove my portable DVD player ahead of time. I remembered reading this, and pulled up the site on my iPhone; sure enough, it said 'full-size DVD players'. I explained this to the rep, explaining that's what you hook up to your TV at home. His response? \"There's no such thing as a full-size DVD player.\" Since he had been quite polite up to that point (and thanked me for putting all my power cords in a bag), I didn't push the issue, but obviously at least one rep @ Detroit isn't quite familiar with what 'portable' means.\nHow about training ALL TSA inspectors to recognize basic medical devices? I can't believe I still run into TSA inspectors who act like they have never seen nor heard of a CPAP machine. The last time I was at ELP the inspector obviously did not only know what a CPAP machine was, but became downright twitchy when the smear he ran on my CPAP machine came back positive. I explained to him that CPAP machines such as mine have air filters that trap organics and, thus, can give false positives in devices that test for explosives. It was clear to me that he had no idea what I was talking about.\n....Long Lines? One of the problems we have is that passengers do not understand or follow the instructions for the screening process. THE LESS ON BOARD BAGGAGE THE BETTER. Follow the 311 rule. If you pack a bag full of electronics and wires, its going to be search. Do you know what a detonator looks like? I do, but when you insist on bringing a bag on board with items that you won't need on the flight, there will be bag searches.The only reason I fly is for business reasons. I fly at least 2x a week for 49 weeks out of the year. I carry lots of computer equipment with me (again job related), no liquids in carry on luggage, and have dealt with snotty TSOs (quite often) and professional TSOs (rarely). I know the routine (empty pockets into laptop bag, shoes, belt and glasses off, coat off, laptop out of bag and into a bin). I've arrived at an airport at 0430 to catch a flight at 0630 only to discover that neither the airlines nor TSA have opened up (what about the 2 hr rule?), have been rousted by a cop (MPLS) for standing at an empty line waiting to be first in line when they opened up the counter, and have been subjected to excesses by TSA hirlings.Your organization has a long way to go before I would consider it professional. I recently traveled through Amsterdam and Helsinki and was pleasantly surprised by how those security types handled passengers (both passport and gate screeners). Why can't TSA learn a lesson from those guys (who've a much longer history dealing with terrorists than the US)? I wince when seeing little children and the obviously disabled getting the 'treatment' from TSO's and have refrained from commenting. No more will I do that. Outrageous conduct, witnessed by me on the part of TSA will be reported to the local FSD and TSA hqtrs. I usually have lots of time on my hands while at the airport (arrive two hours early for check in and security screening).\nMy family and I just flew from Phoenix today. The TSA folks were helpful and friendly through the security checkpoints. When we got home though, it was a big surprise to find all of my husbands sampoo, body wash, toothpaste and cream medicines with caps off leaking all over his clothes. My daughters suitcase had similar issues. I don't see why it has to be this way. It seems as though the people we are trusting and paying to secure our baggage are taking advantage of us.\nHere's an idea. Seal off the captain's cabin from the rest of the airplane. Give the cabin a separate entrance. Terrorists will not be able to enter cabin. Terrorism problem solved. We go back to reasonable (vs. excessive) precautions at our airports.\nAnother anonymous poster said:P.S. Naysayers, (especially winstonsmith) Please consider the following:What if the terrorist plot is to blow up the plane in the sky over a major American city and not a repeat of 9-11?Does this change the equation for you?Well, does it?So what if the terrorist plot is to blow up the plane in the sky? Is the TSA equipped to catch these terrorists any better than the private screeners were pre-9/11? Nope. They are not. They are certainly no more capable of capturing things going through the checkpoints. Cargo is not yet screened 100%, so we can't claim that. We were already checking for explosives pre-9/11. People's ability to create actual explosives on planes has been debunked thoroughly on this blog and elsewhere, so no, this does not change the equation.Any other questions you want to ask me?\nI have to agree with retired navy man Cliff Woodrick and others with disabilities who have posted with similar complaints. To the wag who told us to take a bus or cab or train or drive instead, many of us already have chosen to do so.I’ve given up flying until more sane accommodations are made for people with titanium prosthetics. I had both hips replaced ten years ago and since 2001, flying has become an exercise in humiliation that I refuse to participate in any more. I was issued cards following my surgery that are useless. TSA personnel have pointed out that they can be forged and even if they were legitimate, I could still be carrying a weapon. So I understand the predicament. I just don’t like it. Every time with absolutely no exceptions, I have been singled out for searches whenever I fly. Every time it is embarrassing. 80-90% of TSA personnel have been professional and courteous about the situation; but I’ve had enough of the finger pointing and snickering by other passengers. The Denver airport was the worst and the straw that broke this camel’s back. I was put in an elevated plastic cage in full view of all arriving and departing passengers and left there for ten minutes while passengers streamed by and made fun of my situation. Finally being searched in the cage was even more embarrassing. I can now appreciate how fish in a bowl and caged zoo animals must feel.I consider myself a professional in my field, I am civic-minded and active in my community, and outside of a few minor traffic tickets, have a spotless record. So I naturally resent the fact that my country’s security personnel constantly consider me a potential criminal. All because I have fake hips. I wish I had a simple solution for this problem, but alas I do not; but until one is found, I’m driving no matter what the cost of gas or distance.\nHi -I fly 1-3x / week and know airports pretty darn well.The TSA is one of the most poorly-run organizations I have ever encountered. Coupled with the significance of their role, it's shameful that we sit still for it.Screeners make under $10 an hour? No wonder I have an awful feeling of \"lights on, absolutely no one home ... for years ...\" when speaking to many of your employees.Your QA systems - if they indeed exist - are inadequate. Screening is haphazard, rules are not only enforced inconsistently, but there is a constant thrum of belligerence in many of your employees. When I spoke my mind about the intrusiveness of one TSA screener in McCarran (Las Vegas), he followed me into the terminal, yelling at me as I walked away. He was eventually told to stop by a police officer (blonde man, about 30, working the first-class lane in Terminal B). While perhaps more noticeable, this is not an isolated incident. TSA staff are often uneducated, hostile and simply unintelligent (another favorite: having a bracelet of rhinestones mistaken for \"drill bits,\" also at McCarran's first-class lane - wowzers, the stupidity!).This is a problem about which you not only CAN do something, you owe it to us, as well as to whatever shred of personal dignity you folks have left: teach your employees to be fair, rational, and courteous. You are NOT 'doing us a favor,' and the constant sanctimony about \"thuh terrorists\" sounds like so much self-justifying drivel.As it is now, I get more intelligent and polite service at Del Taco drive-throughs than TSA. What does it take for you to finally become embarrassed to the point of improvement?\n\"But as far as I am concerned, my greatest fear is that someone will walk in amongst people waiting in line and detonate a IED! The second fear I have is that I miss a IED that goes on a plane and blows up not only killing the \"Anonymous\" TSO haters here but those beautiful people who I swore to protect.\"So it is them or us again. FYI the beautiful people mostly fly through General Aviation, so they never get the benefit of your \"protection\".Passengers don't hate TSO's indiscriminately, they just have no liking for the unprofessional behavior that some of them exhibit. Once those few bad apples are eliminated, things will be more pleasant.\nAnonymous said...\"Please fill the trunk of your car with food, drinks, and condiments and drive to your destination!Don't forget your GAS card!\"Why do you automatically assume that this was a TSO?Walks like a duck, quacks like a duck....\n\"Anonymous said... I have no idea who some of these TSO's are, responding to some of these \"Anonymous\"idiots who post here.\"Let me see, you are posting anonymously, and complaining about anonymous idiots. Hmmmm...\nWhat items are clearly allowed as carry-on food?wrapped Candy/nutrition/fruit bars?homemade sandwiches?bagged nuts/fruit/trailmix?chips or crackers?boxed items- what sizes are permitted?I think that it is fair to say that the guidelines are very unclear about these items and permitted quantities.\nhi sandrayou commented on child screening and i though it would be nice to explain this process a bit.i am sure u are aware of the fact that profiling is ineffective since a terrorist can look like anyone and be from anywhere. If you’ve read any newspapers there are countless atrocities reported oversees where women and children are harnessed in killings.Given these bleak truths the TSA is trained to screen everyone acordinglyTSO's are not looking to screen your 9 moth old or your 5year old... they are merely insuring that there is nothing prohibited being smuggled in via covert means.Having your child scream at the top of his/her lungs while being patted down... is a bit cruel and excessive and will lead to a bit more of a delay as you explain this disruption to a supervisor.The child will not be screened without an accompanying adult present, so of course you will be briefed on what will occur and you will be watching.if anything you can always complain to the STSO if you feel something was done wrong during your screening.It is never the TSA's intension to cause you anguish. Obviously screening is not something we do for fun but rather to clear any alarms or solve any selectee designations. It is a matter of security and we will not take the risk of assuming.I'm sorry this bothers you but it’s always important to maintain \"better safe then sorry\" sincerelyTSO :)\nMy gripe is at Kansas City International Airport (MCI) the TSA will not allow a passenger to take drinks into the secure area. Although everytime I fly out, early especially the flight crew are allowed their Starbucks in as well as bottle water. Why as there is no decent place inside the secure area to purchase something are the flight crew allowed? Are they special? The rule should be one rule if it is dangerous then it is dangerous for all. If the captain needs his Starbucks in the morning let him get up early and get it just like the rest of us. Stand in line like us and no you do not have special \"Cut in Line priviledge!\" As a very frequent flyer this practice is not allowed in larger airports.\n\"I am extremely cordial with passengers and go out of my way to greet the passenger, smile at the passenger, give helpful hints to the passenger, and wish them a great day and a happy flight, no matter what duty station I'm on.If you have a situation with a TSO, talk to the STSO and a Complaint form will be filled out.

It is true that it is not required to show ID, however if you do not show ID you will be subject to secondary(additional) screening. That letter that you refer to was also published 2 months before TSA began checking ID's and boarding passes in place of the contracted company doing so.\nI may be wrong but it seems to me that there is alot of anti-TSA \"spam\" here.I'm still waiting for the \"anonymous\" poster to \"school TSO's\" about the exceptions to the 311 rule. What are they?I applaud the Navy Veteran with the two replaced knees for his service! However if you walk through the MAG and it alarms you will be asked to exit and reentered. If you set the alarms off again you will be \"wanded\"! Thats everyone.The poster who has a reason for his CPAP setting off alarms when it is tested....clean it! I've seen filters on CPAP machines co crusted, it is a wonder air gets through. Secondly, TSO's are not trained to accept your excuse why, they have to test to be sure.Ah yes, the DVD player. The rule is that it comes out of the case.Sandra is the best though. Appalled at children being patted down!! I guess we are the only country in the world that does it? BTW, the correct name is a \"Process\"! The reason that the child is being processed 99% of the time is because the Airline you purchased your tickets from....called for it!!So if you have a gripe against TSO's, at least know what you are talking about.\nTSA Carry-on Regulations Update — August 4, 2007 As of August 4, 2007, the TSA is requiring travelers to remove full-size game consoles (examples include Playstation, X-box, and Nintendo), CD and DVD players from their carry-on bags for separate X-ray screening at security checkpoints. They will be handled the same way laptops and larger video cameras (that use cassettes) have been for some time. The TSA states that “Small electronic items, such as cell phones, MP3 players, iPods and portable video game systems do not have to be removed from their carrying cases.” Bear in mind, however, that since this is a new regulation, there may be some initial confusion or misinterpretation on the part of the TSA inspectors. Be prepared to remove any and all electronics from your carry-on bag, and allow a little extra time for screening.Also new as of August 4th, the TSA has relaxed the ban on lighters in carry-on luggage: “In an effort to concentrate resources on detecting explosive threats, TSA will no longer ban common lighters in carry-on luggage as of August 4, 2007. Torch lighters remain banned in carry-ons.Lifting the lighter ban is consistent with TSA's risk-based approach to aviation security. First and foremost, lighters no longer pose a significant threat. Freeing security officers up from fishing for 22,000 lighters every day (the current number surrendered daily across the country) enables them to focus more on finding explosives, using behavior recognition, conducting random screening procedures and other measures that increase complexity in the system, deterring terrorists. The U.S. is the only country in the world to ban lighters – all other nations, including Israel and the U.K., do not.”In addition, the TSA has modified the regulations on carrying breast milk through security checkpoints: “Mothers flying with, and now without, their child will be permitted to bring breast milk in quantities greater than three ounces as long as it is declared for inspection at the security checkpoint.Breast milk is in the same category as liquid medications. Now, a mother flying without her child will be able to bring breast milk through the checkpoint, provided it is declared prior to screening.”Travelers will not be asked to taste the milk to prove it is not a liquid explosive.\n\"BOY, YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT COMPLETELY - DID IT EVER ACCUR TO YOU DO NOT NEED A SECRET CLEARANCE FOR YOUR JOBS SSI INFORMATION THAT USE MUST USE TO PERFORM YOUR JOB??IF YOU ACTUALLY WERE AWARE OF THIS, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE COMMENTED ON THAT.\"Don't be silly. If information is classified, you need a clearance - even if it's only a garden-variety FOUO (For Official Use Only) clearance, which requires no background check. If SSI material is unclassified in your organization, I would call it \"SBU\" (Sensitive But Unclassified). We call this \"open source\". It is restricted, but unclassified, which means that it technically can be released to those who have no clearance. The exclusion categories for this include \"national security\". Good luck fitting that category to include the specific criteria for taking your shoes off in an airport security line.The funny thing about what you said is, not only do you need the SSI information you alluded to in order to perform your job; but travelers need that information to know how to get through your checkpoints. It would be like us setting up a checkpoint in Iraq, not posting any procedures, and then shooting people for violating the procedures that we didn't post.Oh, and would you mind writing using lower-case? All-caps is considered rude on the Internet.\nNow that a TSA-certified flight deck officer's gun has accidentally discharged during a US Airways commercial flight, who is going to protect us from those who are protecting us?Can one request \"handgun-free\" flights from the airlines?\nTo the lady, Sandra, with the comment on the patting down of infants. Unfortunately you are not seeing all sides to the enforcement of security at the airports. In your eyes it may seem that the patting down of children is absurd but the TSA is unable to make assunmptions about any individual coming through security and all persons who alarm or children being carried by sn adult who alarmed must get screened.If you did research and thought about the logic behind TSA screening infants you would find that there have been multiple incidents where children and infants have been used as suicide bombers and terrorists. Children are vulnerable and for a suicide bomber they may be a prime choice to try and get past the security process.Unfortunately as absurd as it may seem, it is what our world has come to and it has to be done or the U.S. will be compromised again.\nWhile it's unfortunate that we need security checkpoints, I feel that TSA employees have a thankless job. Perhaps if passengers knew what they were doing before getting in the security line TSA personnel would treat people better. When we go through the line we do what we're supposed to do, TSA treats us fine, and we say \"Thank You\" to each that we have contact with.As with everything in life, acting properly and politely goes a long way.So, we say TSA is doing an adequate job given what they're dealing with. We prefer screening rather than dangerous objects going onto a plane we're riding in. THANK YOU TSA.\nHello Anonymous Person:To the following:In your eyes it may seem that the patting down of children is absurd but the TSA is unable to make assunmptions about any individual coming through security and all persons who alarm or children being carried by sn adult who alarmed must get screened.If you did research and thought about the logic behind TSA screening infants you would find that there have been multiple incidents where children and infants have been used as suicide bombers and terrorists.It is theoretically possible to wire a baby as a bomb, true. Can you cite a single incidence where this has been tried (since you claim multiple incidences, just one will do)? No, strollers don't count. We're talking baby here. Similarly for children -- there have been documented cases where people have blown up children as part of a suicide bombing (i.e. leaving them in a rigged car perhaps to make the car look less suspicious to passers by -- an incident that was reported recently coming out of Iraq comes to mind for that) but it was the car, not the kids who were rigged to blow. The children were no less the victims of this than anyone else who may have been unfortunate enough to be in the immediate vicinity of the exploding car.All kinds of crazy things are theoretically possible. It is impossible to guard against every micro threat that comes along. The kid does not understand why a strange adult is patting him or her down and why Mommy and Daddy can do nothing but watch it happen. All the kid understands is that he's scared. So are the parents. So is everyone else who watches this -- is it going to be my turn next?Leave the kids alone. They have enough to worry about with the mess the people in power are leaving to them to clean up without the TSA's help.\nI'm still waiting for the \"anonymous\" poster to \"school TSO's\" about the exceptions to the 311 rule. What are they?Medications?Food/drink for diabetics?OTC medications?We, the traveling public are tired of dealing with made up on the spot rules and regulations. Many of us fly on a weekly basis and know when we're being fed a shovel of used bull food.Oh, and please someone define the term 'reasonable amounts.\"\nI applaud the Navy Veteran with the two replaced knees for his service! However if you walk through the MAG and it alarms you will be asked to exit and reentered. If you set the alarms off again you will be \"wanded\"! Thats everyone.Wanded is one thing. Being frisked like a criminal suspect is something else. 99.99% of the people who fly aren't in any way criminals.

I have a TSA approved lock (i.e., one for which the TSA has a key) for my suitcase, although I usually carry on. On one flight recently, however, I checked my bag .. but forgot to lock the suitcase. Thus, the lock was attached and secured, but not preventing the suitcase from being opened. When the bag arrived, the lock was removed, gone. Only a TSA person could have removed the lock.March 23, 2008 11:44 AM I work in bags and I see locks that have fallen off via the belt system all the time. Sometimes they don't lock all the way (even tho we think that they do) sometimes they pop open, sometimes they get ripped off. I'm sorry that that happened to you but it is not always TSA's fault. Anonymous said... On a direct flight from Memphis to Detroit, jewelry was stolen from my suitcase. The jewelry was packed inside of a box, which was packed inside of a zipped up bagged.

I would not risk my job for some jewlery most of my co-workers would not either.\ni am a photographer who still shoots film. when i travel i usually take 60-80 rolls of 220 film with me. since all the new rules after 9/11, tsa employees routinely open every single plastic packaging of each roll of film, exposing the paper-backed film to the air (roll film is different from 35mm - it is not protected by a metal cannister). because i do not want to put 800asa roll film through the x-ray machine (film ends up with xray lines crosshatching the film) all of my film becomes exposed to the elements, causing the film to take in moisture, which can in turn ruin the film. is there anything i can do to protect my 800asa 220 roll film in the future?\nComment-curious as to whether or not spurs on western boots pose a possible weapons threat. Did I also mention knitting needles of various number sizes. Anyone with any knowledge of close quarters contact know that either of the above mentioned items can and will do serious or fatal results. Yet I consistantly see these items being passed through security w/o as much as a look at. Want to witness unqualified, untrained TSA officers, try Fairbanks, AK. I travel through there two to three times a month. One never knows what to expect. Of course, neither do they. Just roll your eye and wonder how these folks were selected for this highly sensative position. Makes for a good time passing conversation with other travelers. Thank you.\nIt is so easy for people to bash TSA and what they do but in all reality the people who are making comments about TSA and how unprofessional they are and how they treat people like criminals (especially elderly, children and people with disabilites)are the ones who are on the outside looking in and have no idea what they are talking about. Bottom line is that there will never be a time when all persons are satisfied with how the security process is. Right now people non-stop complain that TSA does too much and takes away too many items and screens people who should not be bothered with so they think security should be lessened.But the second something happens and the nation is put in an uproar then TSA will be blamed because they did not do enough. TSA is in a lose-lose situation but continues to do their job day in and day out despite all the negativity made about them.TSA as with any company is always trying to improve but nothing in life can ever be 100% error proof. People are so quick to judge TSA and blame them for anything that goes wrong with flying, whether it be their flight being delayed, showing up late, something is missing from luggage, items are broke, what have you. TSA is not the fault of everyones problems and a sensible person would sit back and think about it for awhile and realize that TSA screeners are human just as anybody else.\nTo the lady complaining about the lotions and shampoos leaking all over her daughters clothes, it is called ZIPLOC bags and they sell them at stores so you can put your spillables in them and they will not leak. I am not sure if you are familiar with an airplane and flying but there is such a thing called air pressure and unfortunately when a plane gets high in altitude containers and such tend to expand and burst. The same thing would happen if you brought a bag of chips on a plane unopened, the bag would expand. Just thought i would help you out.\nThis is in response to the person whose jewelry was stolen. I am sorry for your loss, but the TSO's are not the one and only people who have access to your baggage after you check it with the airlines. After the TSO's screen your luggage, there are at least three other people who handle the property. 1. the person who loads the bag on the tug to take it to the plane. 2. the person who unloads from the tug and onto the conveyor into the plane itself. and 3. (most likely of the three) the person in the belly of the plane loading and stacking the luggage where there is no (that I know of) cameras to keep watch on them.\nI am a scientist, and as such I would like to see factual analysis of the efficacy of TSA screening.The only scientific evaluation of TSA´s work I have found to date is published in the last issue of 2007 British Medical Journal (you can download it at www.bmj.com, archive, 2007, Dec 22). The article (Screening programme evaluation applied to airport security, by Eleni Linos, Elizabeth Linos and Graham Colditz) is very well put together and brings up important questions. Could a TSA person on this blog please answer the questions in that article? Better still, could the TSA please publish a serious, peer reviewed work showing that its policies are effective?\nFirst time to the Blog, SHEESH - nothing constructive just a bunch of crybabys with no common sense, venting their frustration about rules and regulations now that they consider themselves adults, I just see the 3rd graders complaining about having to remove their shoes to take a nap. As far as food and such thru the checkpoint for babies, I don't see any under fed kids out their in the lanes, on the contrary. just feed your kids b-4 you fly and use the drinking fountain inside security (poor baby)I always thought the proper terminolgy was \"handy capable\" stop using your old age or military background as a crutch to skate security. You will be playing golf when you land anyway.GET OVER IT and FACE THE FACTS this is the way it is going to be from now on when you travel the friendly skies. You all probably yell at the McDonalds attendant TOO!\n\"This is in response to the person whose jewelry was stolen. I am sorry for your loss, but the TSO's are not the one and only people who have access to your baggage after you check it with the airlines. After the TSO's screen your luggage, there are at least three other people who handle the property. 1. the person who loads the bag on the tug to take it to the plane. 2. the person who unloads from the tug and onto the conveyor into the plane itself. and 3. (most likely of the three) the person in the belly of the plane loading and stacking the luggage where there is no (that I know of) cameras to keep watch on them.\"It is TSA that created the opportunity for theft, however. Not properly resealing luggage, cutting off TSA approved locks, and doing nothing to prevent theft is the problem. Handing over the luggage in a non-secure condition just aggravates the situation, as well as annoying the public. Blaming the airline baggage handlers does nothing to make the situation more palatable to the public. The baggage security issue is the TSA's problem, if you wanted to resolve it you could. A tamper proof seal of some description together with a tag that stated that the bag had been searched, a time stamped tag inside the luggage, all would help resolve the issue of responsibility for theft. Some TSA employees have been let go or prosecuted for this very issue of theft.\nOn a direct flight from Memphis to Detroit, jewelry was stolen from my suitcase. The jewelry was packed inside of a box, which was packed inside of a zipped up bagged. The jewelry were the only items taken, and no card was left to indicate that my luggage had been searched. I know that my suitcase had been tampered with, because the zippers were in a different location than where I put them. The only time my suitcase was out of my possession was when I turned it in to the TSA people at the airport in Memphis.Memphis is rather infamous for baggage thefts. I've had more things stolen from there than at any other airport. It is possible, also, that a TSA type was working in conjuction with one of the ramp rats. This doesn't bring back your jewelry. Next time carry it with you to keep the theives at bay. The airlines don't allow for claims for expensive items (jewelry, laptops, medications, etc)in checked luggage because they know that they have both theives working for them and customers who file claims for non-existing items.\nTo the person whose jewelry was stolen - don't pack valuables in your luggage. This is written on just about every piece of travel literature. Either wear them or don't take them. Any many people have access to luggage, not just the TSA.\n\"First time to the Blog, SHEESH - nothing constructive just a bunch of crybabys with no common sense, venting their frustration about rules and regulations now that they consider themselves adults, I just see the 3rd graders complaining about having to remove their shoes to take a nap.

Got a problem with \"traveler envy\"?Do YOU have a problem with parents being concerned with the health, safety, and wellbeing of their children? Are you a parent? A good parent?\n\"I wince when seeing little children and the obviously disabled getting the 'treatment' from TSO's and have refrained from commenting. No more will I do that. Outrageous conduct, witnessed by me on the part of TSA will be reported to the local FSD and TSA hqtrs. I usually have lots of time on my hands while at the airport (arrive two hours early for check in and security screening).\"It is abuse, and should be stopped! The more that this issue is brought to the attention of the blog,and to the public through the media, the more likely it will be addressed by TSA officials, hopefully before it becomes crisis management.\nTo me its the same neurotic anti-TSA posting here. What a waste of a valuable information tool for people who use the Air Ports, Ports and Railroads.Never mind what the truth is, this mal-content is going to jam this blog with garbage.To other TSO's who post here, do what you wish, but don't waste your time on this \"passenger\"!\nMr. Anonymous Scientist:Thanks for posting the following:The only scientific evaluation of TSA´s work I have found to date is published in the last issue of 2007 British Medical Journal (you can download it at www.bmj.com, archive, 2007, Dec 22). The article (Screening programme evaluation applied to airport security, by Eleni Linos, Elizabeth Linos and Graham Colditz) is very well put together and brings up important questions.Could a TSA person on this blog please answer the questions in that article? Better still, could the TSA please publish a serious, peer reviewed work showing that its policies are effective?March 25, 2008 6:56 AMI have been asking the TSA now since I started posting to this forum to produce some kind of documentable proof that the tradeoffs they force upon the traveling public in terms of dollar cost and lost liberty in exchange for what appears to be effectively illusory security are worth it. One of the central themes of the many things that I have posted is that some security is necessary, but the extremes to which the TSA has gone, particularly with checkpoint security, are ridiculous; constitutionally questionable; morally repugnant; and sickening to anyone who values their rights and the sacrifices people have made to protect those rights in the past.To date, no such proof has been offered. I doubt any such proof exists. There will be plenty of people who will respond in knee-jerk fashion to this by saying, \"well prove that it hasn't.\" It is not for us to prove a negative. The TSA makes the claim that it protects. Let them prove to us that it has succeeded in its mission.\nI don't like the new lanes TSA are making to get people threw faster.What you are doing is giving blue print on how to figure out how and when to get something threw. This is by having a routine for the family lane or the business lane etcThe TSO's will fall into a routine and when that happens there will be problemsDT\n\"The TSO's will fall into a routine and when that happens there will be problems.\"Not hardly, if the routine that they fall into is a routine of thorough, professional checks made to the best of their abilities and those of the equipment they use.\n\"To me its the same neurotic anti-TSA posting here.

The moderators decide what gets posted.What passes muster might not be for the thin skinned, especially people who are unable to accept and learn from the information shared here. It probably isn't a very easy job being a TSO, but there are some who do it well. My own concerns are about the ethical, fair, humane and non-abusive treatment on both the passenger and TSO sides of this debate. The elderly, the disabled, children, and TSO's all have the right to the same fair treatment.Unfortunately, it begins with the TSO community. It is part of your job description to be courteous and professional. Barring some heroic action, your job probably won't get many accolades. Sadly, many people see what you do as an intrusion in their lives. This dialog might seed some changes. Who knows, but we can hope.\nDear Winstonsmith,Thank you for supporting my petition for hard data from the TSA. Let us hope that more people read this and force some kind of information (which I also doubt exists) from these people.Don't miss the British Medical Journal article. It is great!\nThis is the conclusion of the British Medical Journal article:\"ConclusionOf course, we are not proposing that money spent on unconfirmed but politically comforting efforts to identify and seize water bottles and skin moisturisers should be diverted to research on cancer or malaria vaccines. But what would the National Screening Committee recommend on airport screening? Like mammography in the 1980s, or prostate specific antigen testing and computer tomography for detecting lung cancer more recently, we would like to open airport security screening to public and academic debate. Rigorously evaluating the current system is just the first step to building a future airport security programme that is more user friendly and cost effective, and that ultimately protects passengers from realistic threats.\"\nA few of my favorite parts of the BMJ article:\"With such high value attached to airport security, the details of efficacy, precision, and cost effectiveness of screening methods are easy to ignore. Protection at any cost is a reassuring maxim for us jetsetters. But preventing any death—whether from haemorrhagic stroke, malignant melanoma, or diabetic ketoacidosis—is surely an equally noble cause. In most such cases, screening programmes worldwide are closely evaluated and heavily regulated before implementation. Is airport security screening an exception?\"\"Since 1969, only 2000 people have died as a result of explosives on planes, yet the US department of homeland security spends more than $500m annually on research and development of programmes to detect explosives at airports. Even the devastating 11 September 2001 attacks caused around 3000 deaths, which is similar to the number of deaths attributed to high blood glucose each day13 or the number of children dying of the human immunodeficiency virus every three days worldwide.\"\"Furthermore, the cost of airport security ($9 per passenger) is 1000 times higher than for railway security ($0.01 per passenger), even though the number of attacks on trains is similar to that in planes. This is analogous to committing mammography resources to screening only the left breast, and ignoring the right side, even though cancer can affect both breasts.\"\"We systematically reviewed the literature on airport security screening tools. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, Lexis, Nexis, JSTOR, and Academic Search Premier (EBSCOhost) found no comprehensive studies that evaluated the effectiveness of x ray screening of passengers or hand luggage, screening with metal detectors, or screening to detect explosives. When research teams requested such information from the US Transportation Security Administration they were told that evaluating new screening programmes might be useful, but it was overshadowed by \"time pressures to implement needed security measures quickly.\"\nI had a extremely unpleasant encounter with the TSA officers while traveling through the San Diego airport SAN last saturday (March 22, 2008). How it happened was that I somehow set off the metal detector alarm, I have absolutely no idea how that is possible because the ONLY metallic thing on my body was the underwire in my bra, and other people that I was traveling with were able to walk through with belts on, change in their pockets, jewelry, ect without setting off the same exact metal detector's alarm. So, I was pulled inside and put into the \"box\" that is on the other side of the metal detectors. As I was standing in there, I politely asked if I or possibly one of the officers could retrieve my stuff which included a brand new laptop, a purse with cash, cellphone and bag, because other passengers were knocking my laptop around and moving it while retrieving their own bags, also I was concerned that my things could be stolen (since airports are one of the highest theft areas). The officer rudely snapped at me \"You cannot leave here, and don't worry about your stuff.\" While I waited, my laptop was knocked onto the floor, and upon turning it on I found that the screen is now damaged. I was treated like a criminal and told to stand in the \"box\" and not allowed to even place my objects in a safe place. Then they used the wand and patted me down as if I were a criminal. That wouldn't have been so bad if the security officers would not have been complete jerks (There other words that describe them much better). While the officer was waving the wand over my chest area it kept going off, and it was mysteriously going off while passing over my shoulder. The officer rudely asked if I had anything metallic in my shoulder or chest area, and I told her maybe underwire in my bra, but I have no idea why it would be going off while passing my shoulder. Then the officer became even ruder with me. The she patted down my shoulder/chest area, and I was already wearing a skin-tight shirt, it was pretty obvious that there was nothing in this area of my body. Then while searching my bag, the officer asked me if I had anything 'round' in my bag. I had a confused look and said \"I'm not sure\", and then the officer began to yell at me. I'm sorry that I did not take an inventory of the various shapes of the items that I had packed in my bag. \"Do you have anything round?\" is such a vague and off-hand question that my only quick on the response could be something like \"I'm not sure.\" Then the officer opened my jewelry bag, and a piece of jewelry fell on the floor and the officer just stepped on it like it was nothing. When I reached to pick it up to place it on the table she yelled \"DO NOT TOUCH THAT.\"I really hate being treated like a criminal and my personal possessions treated like garbage. The saddest thing is that my story isn't nearly as bad as other stories of read on this blog or reports that I have heard on the news. My heart goes out to all of the people who have been harassed and abused by TSA people. Thank you TSA for allowing my brand new $2,000 computer to be broken. (I could not have it retrieved when I asked POLITELY, and of course laptops have to come out of their protective padded bags.)Also, thank you TSA for treating me like a CRIMINAL. The terrorists are getting what they wanted. Our civil liberties and freedoms are being chipped away one by one, and the Bill of Rights is being thrown out the window. I hope these TSA officers enjoy their jobs of treating innocent people like criminals and pieces of crap.\nHmmm, I suspect that the SOPs governing the day-to-day operations were written by career paper pushers with little thought given to the what-if senarios that engineers would have discussed. Grammar correct?Spelling correct?Okay we're ready to use this as policy. I suspect that little thought went into reactions of US citizens, or the much longer lasting repercussions for a slip-shod, half baked, SOP. Homeland security and TSA have me shaking my head and wondering just what were they thinking when they put pen to paper. From the TSA's own website: 3-1-1 for carry-ons = 3 ounce bottle or less (by volume) ; 1 quart-sized, clear, plastic, zip-top bag; 1 bag per passenger placed in screening bin. One-quart bag per person limits the total liquid volume each traveler can bring. 3 oz. container size is a security measure.The rule limits the volume of liquids, gels and aerosols to bottles 3 ounces or smaller (or 100 ml), in 1 quart-sized zip top bag, and 1 bag per traveler.All liquids, gels and aerosols must be in three-ounce or smaller containers. Larger containers that are half-full or toothpaste tubes rolled up are not allowed. Each container must be three ounces or smaller.So just what is allowed? You lack consistancy even on the place, we fliers use. You wonder why you get so much grief over things like this. FYI 3oz doesn't equal 100mL.Fix the minor details like this and your jobs will become easier.\nThe last few years my wife and I have traveled internationally. We had not traveled just with in the USA until this month.We made a quick 4 day weekend trip and packed two small suitcases. One we checked and one we carried on during the out bound trip, as we were taking some Tequila to my brother in law to try.On the way home we decided to carry both suitcases on board, something we have not had the opportunity to do for years. We did not think about some of the liquids that tend to stay in the suitcase we normally check. The TSA people a John Wayne Airport were extremely nice in requesting permission to check our bag, and in explaining why. We knew better but had a brain fade as we were out of our normal routine.I did have to remove my belt and watch, and go through the metal detector again. I was wearing the same belt and watch on the out bound trip, and did not set of the metal detector. Other wise I would have removed them to start with.I understand different machines can have different levels of sensitivity.I do not understand why there are different procedures from one airport to another. Most require shoes removed, a very few do not. This must be training and monitoring issue and should be corrected. Overall we have no problem meeting and complying with the requirements. We have had very few TSA agents who were unfriendly, or difficult. I must say however, that the John Wayne TSA agents were the most pleasant I have ever meet.\nre post by Duane on 03/21/2008 3:18 PM.It has been mentioned in another blog that multiple attempts were made to respond to the post made by Duane.TSA block all post advising Duane to contact local police for 1 1/2 days, a delay that could prevent an effective investigation of the incident.I have to wonder if TSA places its agenda above the 8 year old citizen that went through the TSA checkpoint? What does TSA have to hide?Smells like an attempt to cover-up the actions of a TSO.TSA continues to disappoint!\nHere's another horror story from FlyerTalk about the TSA's treatment of a 2 year old child:\"I flew out of PHX Saturday March 8th with my wife and 2 year old and they seperated* my son from us and patted him down. I have filed a complaint with Office of Civil Rights which is part of TSA, but have not had any response in almost two weeks. I am spending time today writing my Congresswoman and Senator and trying to find some way to get this addressed. There were two people who wound up being very helpful, but two were hostile and had our 2 year placed on a chair against a wall and had us stand four feet away and turn our backs on him while they decided who was going to pat down my son.I have heard repeatedly that people are horrified by this experience and they recommend I contact legal counsel.\"*The TSA's website says they will NOT separate you from your child.Among comments to the above were:\"This seems cruel. I know that there are many *$&%*##$ TSA types, but surely they don't condone cruelty to children. Is there any sort of logic or justification for isolating a 2 year old and making his parents turn away from him? Are there really TSA staff who are that sadistic, and others who would let such behavior go on without comment or correction?\"\"A situation such as .....'s child endured could very well produce signs of trauma: not sleeping well, nightmares, fear of airports, clinging to parents, not wanting to go to nursery school/day care. What happened to him was despicable and it seems to be becoming the norm rather than an aberration.\"\"....consider filing an abuse complaint with the Phoenix PD\"The flying public, as others have said, must start to speak up. If you see the TSA treating a child or a disabled person with disrespect or in an abusive manner, speak up so that other people in line can hear you, point out the abusive treatment, call a police officer, call a supervisor..... don't wait until such things happen to you, take a stand for your fellow travelers.I would love to see a coordinated day of civil disobedience at our airports, where thousands of people join together and say WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.\nI had an umbrella confiscated by the TSA at the Portland (Oregon) Memorial Coliseum prior to a Barack Obama rally because \"it was too long.\" only a few of us were tsa the were secret service. they were having tsa do their bag checks. their uniforms look really similar to ours. next time look around.\nWhile traveling from Detroit with TSA approved locks---the fastening hole for the lock was snipped thereby making the lock useless. Looks like someone needs glasses. We were following the \"directive\" for having TSA approved locks. Hmmmm.\nTSA needs to train their employees to THINK on some passengers. My Dad is in his 80s, has had bypass surgery, wears a pacemaker, has congestive heart failure, and walks slowly, and has to stop to rest. He brings his medical records to the airport, to no avail. He has put up with the indignity of an employee putting their hands inside his belt. Come on! THINK --this is a church official who travels on church business, never had a speeding ticket or parking ticket--Hands off my Dad! This is clearly invasive --and absolutely not necessary. THINK --this is not a 'bomb-carrying' individual--and the medical papers should be enough to let him pass without the indignities in the extra search. He doesn't complain, but I travel with him, and think you should change your policies to include some common sense.\nAnonymous said... only a few of us were tsa the were secret service. they were having tsa do their bag checks. their uniforms look really similar to ours. next time look around.The use of TSO instead of professional contract security brings up a few questions.What budget do the loaner TSOs get paid from? TSA, Treasury Dept., or Obama's campaign?What law or rule allows for the loaning of TSOs? (Just a general answer here is good. No need to make Francine look up all the case law on a Easter weekend)Who paid for the moving and setting up the equipment?Are TSOs allowed to take other off duty security jobs and wear their TSA issued uniform?If a TSO makes rude comment or steals, what department takes the complaint? TSA or Secret Service?The TRANSPORTATION Security Agency needs to stick with transportation security until they can do that right on a consistent basis.\nAs a traveler with a defibulator, I understand that I must get a patdown everytime I go through security. While inconvienent I understand this. What I do not understand is why some locations require me to leave my belongings and go behind enclosed walls to get to the patdown checkpoint. This happened just 2 weeks ago in San Diego. I was forced to send my belongings through the scanner but since I could not go through the metal detector I had to go around to the exit area while my belongings went through the scanner.After getting to the patdown area I was asked which tubs were mine. However this was AFTER I had them out of sight for about 2 minutes. The people behind me could have easily taken my wallet, phone, keys, etc. What's funny was after I got to the gate area there was an announcement that you should not leave your belongings out of your sight.TSA could easily have escorted me and my belongings to the patdown area and then sent the tubs through the scanner. They could have asked before I left which tubs were mine and made sure they were safe, or at least have special color tubs for these instances so that the agents could monitor the situation.By the way, it doesn't even matter who you are. I am a DHS (not TSA) employee with a top secret clearance and credentials. I was still treated wrong.\nFrom TSA's own website:3-1-1 for carry-ons = 3 ounce bottle or less (by volume) ; 1 quart-sized, clear, plastic, zip-top bag; 1 bag per passenger placed in screening bin. One-quart bag per person limits the total liquid volume each traveler can bring. 3 oz. container size is a security measure.Just for grins I went to take a look at my tube of toothpaste and deodorant. Funny thing is that both of them list the contents by weight instead of volume. FYI TSA weight often doesn't equal volume. How can you possibly state that 3oz of displacement (volume) equals 3, 4, 5 oz of weight? The misaplication of simple mathematics, science, weights and measures calls to question your confiscation of passenger belongings.\nBy the way, it doesn't even matter who you are. I am a DHS (not TSA) employee with a top secret clearance and credentials. I was still treated wrong.Please tell them that you get very excited when separated from your belongings and want them to be visible during your screening process.Good to see someone with some credentials (DHS, TS, ect) complain about the excesses of TSA. Does that mean the rest of us unwashed fliers are now vindicated when we complain?\nBy the way, it doesn't even matter who you are. I am a DHS (not TSA) employee with a top secret clearance and credentials. I was still treated wrong.Just wondering if you took any action after the fact to report this problem to the TSA Chain of Command? Regular civilians only get corrective screening when attempting to voice a concern with TSA!\n\"TSA could easily have escorted me and my belongings to the patdown area and then sent the tubs through the scanner. They could have asked before I left which tubs were mine and made sure they were safe, or at least have special color tubs for these instances so that the agents could monitor the situation.\"I know it may be hard to do, but next time insist on getting your things before you are screened. This IS something the screener should have did for you. It happens at my airport as well.\nHere's my two cent's worth on experiences at several airports, in a fair bit of detail. I'm hoping that my describing each situation in some length that the TSA can see where things went wrong and how the experience can be improved.These comments expand on comments I've made previously about Flint MI, Orlando FL, Atlanta GA and Pensacola FL. More gripes than grins, unfortunately....The recent stories are all gripes. These unfold from August of 2007 to February 2008.Flint MI, Story #1My girlfriend (hereafter referred to as Heather) and I are going through security. Bags go through x-ray, and I hear the infamous call for \"bag check\". We walk up to the tail end of conversation between another passenger and the screener. Both are rather brusque with each other in their tone. Passenger leaves. Screener comments loudly to another screener about how rude that last passenger was to her. (I'm thinking that the screener's tone with that passenger set no example of politeness. Neither did loudly making that comment in public.) Screener starts to look in my girlfriend's carry on, and here's the dialog from there. Screener: Are any \"liquids gels or aerosols\" in the bag?Heather: noScreener: Is there anything metal in the bag or anything I might poke herself on?Heather: (holds hand above bag, and points to rear pocket) There's a nail file in that back pocket. Screener: (yelling) DON'T TOUCH THE BAG WHILE I'M SEARCHING IT !Heather: I not touching the bag. I'm just pointing to the pocket where my nail file is. I don't want you to get stuck.Screener: (yelling louder) DON'T TOUCH THE BAG WHILE I'M SEARCHING IT !Heather: Fine, whatever. (puts her hands at her side.)Screener: (after encountering a tube of lipstick, yelling) THIS HAS TO BE IN YOUR ZIPLOC BAG.Me: (thinking to myself -- a lipstick has a fixed volume and shape. From what I learned in school, that makes it a solid. No point, however, in arguing semantics of states of matter with a power happy ignoramus.)Heather: Fine, I'll put it in there. (Starts to put lipstick in her ziploc, which was pretty full.)Screener: (no longer yelling, but with smug satisfaction) Your ziploc has to be able to close. (obviously thinking \"gotcha\")Me: I've got plenty of room in mine. (I place lipstick in my ziploc, close the top, and hold it up for screener to see. My turn to think \"gotcha\".)Screener: (Walks away without saying a word.)Two major comments:1. The yelling was totally unnecessary and unprovoked. We were being cooperative and trying to play the game by the rules.2. Heather was concerned by for the well-being of the screener, as evidenced by wanting to make sure she didn't get poked by the nail file. The screener reacted by yelling.3. As I have said in prior posts, the TSA needs to stop throwing \"liquids, gels and aerosols\" around like a catch phrase and define what this means in real world terms. I have yet to find a definition on the TSA web site, and have yet to see a link to an official definition on this blog. (TSO NY has posted his thumb rules, but has yet to provide a link to where they may be found for all to see.)4. If the screener is done with you, they should yet you know that in a definitive manner. (Similar to the phrase LEO's use, \"you're free to go.\") Just walking away is rude.5. Less cattiness at the checkpoint, please.Flint MI, Story #2I was the first of four passengers in line. The screening area at this airport has very little background noise. I already had my plastic bins on the table, my notebook PC in a bin, my regulation ziploc in the bin and was starting to take off my shoes. The people in line behind me were doing similarly. Obviously, we all \"knew the drill.\" The screener / wannabe drill instructor started barking orders. \"TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES AND PUT THEM IN THE BIN. PUT ANY NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS IN A BIN. KEEP YOUR BOARDING PASS AND PHOTO ID IN YOUR HAND AT ALL TIMES.\"Comments on this one:1. Did the screener really expect people to remove footwear, pull out notebook PC's, pull out ziploc bags, handle bins, etc. one handed in order to keep their boarding passes and photo id in their hand at all times? What is that supposed to accomplish, anyway? 2. What's wrong with a simple request to \"please have your boarding pass and photo id in hand as you approach the metal detector\"? 3. How about passengers with mobility, strength, or balance issues? For example, there's absolutely no way my Dad could take his shoes off one handed, standing on one foot. I see no accommodation at this checkpoint (or others for that matter) for the elderly, infirm or physically challenged in getting in or out of footwear. Can't the TSA afford a few chairs?4. Is it necessary to yell at four people in a fairly quiet area? The screener only needed to be heard over a distance of ten feet max. A normal conversational voice will carry that far.Orlando FLScreening area is a large open space, and acoustically, it's an echo chamber. PA is blaring endlessly saying to \"keep control of your luggage to prevent introduction of prohibited items\", interleaved with announcements of the terror alert level de jour. Screener is shouting something in such heavily accented English that passengers couldn't understand a word being said. We could see her gesturing and pointing in an angry manner, presumably trying to direct traffic, obviously irritated that the passengers weren't doing what she wanted.Comments on this one:1. Why do the announcements have to go non-stop ? Put some space in between announcements to lessen the overall noise level.2. What difference does it make to me whether it's a yellow day or an orange day, anyway? What's the point of the announcement, anyway, since we're supposed to just \"be about our lives\"?3. If a TSA person can't speak English clearly, they have no business getting irritated with passengers who don't understand whatever she's shouting. Time for ESL and / or accent reduction training.Pensacola FLHeather and I are going through security together. I start the bags through the x-ray, and screener #1 calls for a bag check on one of Heather's carryons. She goes on through the metal detector to resolve the situation, while I hang back to make sure our stuff gets into the x-ray OK (especially not wanting to let my notebook PC out of my sight). Here's the dialog from there:Screener #1: (pulls a tube of mascara out of carryon, starts yelling) THIS HAS TO BE IN YOUR ZIPLOC BAG. Me: (I'm through the metal detector and join Heather. Screener #1 has left to go look at the x-ray machine as more bags come through.) Are we done?Heather: I'm not sure. She made it sound like they want to re-xray my bag without the mascara. I don't want to just walk away if they're not done.Me: Yeah. Don't want to give them any excuses.Screener #2: (Walks behind us, and bellows out) THE LINE IS BACKING UP. EXPEDITE GATHERING YOUR BELONGINGS AFTER THEY GO THROUGH THE X-RAY MACHINE. (He shoots a look of contempts at us and continues to where screener #1 is at the x-ray machine.)Me: (I catch the eye of screener #3, who is standing to the side wearing blue gloves and doing nothing. He immediately looks away and stares into space.) Me: (Quietly to Heather.) Let's get out of here. That guy wants people to expedite gathering their stuff, so I'll take that as our cue to leave.Me: (Projecting my voice straight at screener #3) Since he left, I guess they're done with us. Let's get out of here. Screener #3: (No response. Continues to stare into empty space.)Comments: 1. Again, no effective definition of \"liquids, gels or aerosols\".2. Screener #1 yelled when a normal tone of voice would have gotten the job done. I could hear her yelling from the other side of the metal detector.3. Screener #1 gave no clear indication that we were free to go, and we didn't want to look like we were trying to sneak away. The thanks we got for trying to cooperate was screener #2 yelling orders, when he could have asked us if there was a question or problem. You don't have to yell when you're standing beside us, and spare me the dirty looks. 4. Screener #3 was less than ten feet away when Screeners #1 and #2 were yelling, so he had to know what was going on. By avoiding my gaze, he gave the impression that he did not want to help.5. When I got home and was looking in my bag, I found a 1 oz tube of sunscreen in my carryon that Screener #1 had missed. So much for their self-righteous attitude. If minimal contents of a tube of mascara is such a threat to aviation security, that's nothing compared to a 1 oz sunscreen tube. 6. Again, the yelling was totally unnecessary and unprovoked. We were being cooperative and trying to play the game by the rules.Atlanta GAAcoustics similar to Orlando -- noisy echo chamber. Same announcements going nonstop, too. Big crowds -- it's a few days after Christmas.I walk up to the person checking id's. She doesn't say a word, and just glares at me with a major league scowl on her face and a look of utter hatred in her eyes. (Don't have to be a BDO to detect that.) I say hello, then hand her my passport and boarding pass. She looks at them and silently hands them back. Thinking \"if you see a person without a smile, give them one of yours\", I wish here a happy new year. No response, and no change from scowl.As I head towards the screening lines, there a person there attempting to direct traffic. He looks pretty frazzled, but I couldn't blame him, under the circumstances. At least he isn't yelling. I wish him a happy new year, and he smiles.In line, there's a screener shouting at the passengers, but I couldn't understand him over the general bedlam. Since the people in front of me were doing the usual drill with shoes, ziplocs and computers, I did the same. Screener at metal detector checks my id and boarding pass without saying a word. I wish him a happy new year -- no response. Talk about being treated like cattle.Get to concourse, and there's a lengthly pre-recorded announcement playing about the 3-1-1 requirement. Comments:1. This is the typical \"treat passengers like cattle\" situation. Even if you're going to have a distant manner, don't look at me with a look of utter hatred. If you don't like checking ID's, get another job. If I greet you, respond -- that's ordinary courtesy.2. Same comments as Orlando regarding terror alert de jour announcement and keeping control of your bags.3. Seems silly to have an announcement going about 3-1-1 after everyone has already been through security. Talk about shutting the door after the horse has left the barn !And now on a positive noteFlint MI, Story #3This was one of my first flights post 9/11 and before 3-1-1. Still a bit nervous about flying again. (I didn't fly for two years after the attacks.) I get to the checkpoint, empty my pockets into my carryon, take off cell phone, etc. Here's the conversation from there:Screener #1: (Leans across the table, and looks at my footwear.) Sir, you should probably take those boots off so we can x-ray them. They might have metal shanks.Me: They don't have metal shanks -- I've seen them with the soles off at the cobbler shop.Screener #1: It's easier if you go ahead and take them off. If you set off the metal detector, we'll have to x-ray them anyway.Me: Makes sense. No problem.Metal Detector: BEEP.Screener 2: Sir, do you have anything metal on you? Me: Nothing that detaches. (I grin widely to show my braces.)Screener #2: Sir, if you'd step over here please. (Points to mat with two yellow footprints on it.)Screener #3: Sir, if you'd stand on the footprints and hold your arms out to either side.Me: Sure thing.Screener #3: (Starts wanding me. As he goes over my right shin, wand give off a little \"beep\".)Me: I've got a surgical screw in that shin. It helps hold my knee together. Screener #3: (Keeps wanding.) OK, thanks. We may have to come back and hand check that.Me: No problem.Screener #3: (Keeps wanding. As he goes over my left wrist...)Wand: BEEEEEEPMe: That's my bone-headed mistake for the day -- I forgot to take off my wrist watch.Screener #3: (Pulls my sweater sleeve up and sees it's a watch, and smiles.) No problem. (keeps wanding.)Screener #3: (Finishes wanding.) Thanks for your cooperation, and have a good flight.Me: Thanks. Have a good evening.Comments:1. First and foremost, note the courteous and respectful tone in the screeners' manner. No yelling, and I hadn't been addressed as \"sir\" that many times in one conversation since getting out of the Navy.2. Despite my dumb mistake, the screener was nice about it. No public ass-chewing in front of everyone else.3. Note that when I questioned the need to take off my boots, the question was answered politely.4. All in all, a very positive experience. The screeners had a job to do, no doubt, but were able to do it cordially.Flint MI, Story #4Another post 9/11 and pre 3-1-1 flight. That trip, I decided to fly in a polo shirt, walking shorts and sneakers. Nothing metal in my footwear, and my right shin is in the open in case that screw trips the metal detector. Remembered to take my watch off that time. I'm approaching the metal detector. Here's the conversation from there:Screener: Sir, you should probably take those sneakers off.Me: There's nothing metal -- they won't trip the metal detector. Screener: True, but you'll have to go through secondary screening if you leave them on, and then you'll have to take them off there so we can x-ray them.Me: (In a puzzled tone.) OK, but what's the issue with my sneakers?Screener: It's the thickness of the soles. Me: The Richard Reid scenario? Screener: Exactly.Me: Aha! Makes sense. Thanks for explaining.Screener: You're welcome.Comments: 1. Again, note the courteous and respectful tone in the screener's manner and response to my questions.2. I learned something about the requirements that day. 3. Notice what was missing from the response to my questions -- no authoritarian attitude, no threats, etc. Summing UpIn the pre 3-1-1 world, the screener's seemed like decent people trying to a difficult job. Post, 3-1-1, though, it seems rudeness and suspicion have become institutionalized. Unfortunately, the 3-1-1 rule is implemented in typical bureaucratic fashion. “Liquids, gels or aerosols” becomes quite the catch phrase with the TSO’s, but the flying public is not knowledgeable of all the nuances of exactly what is a “liquid, gel or aerosol”. In the absence of good operational definitions, the TSO's implement their own interpretations of what is a “liquid, gel or aerosol”. Each TSO expects the traveler to know their particular interpretation of the rules. The TSO's treat a passenger who violates their individual interpretation like they are stupid at best, probably uncooperative, and have criminal intent at worst. The TSO's appear to be inventing requirements, such as the \"requirement\" that one's 3 oz bottles have to be \"labeled\" (such as TSO NY's posts), but don't specify in what manner. Hey blog moderators -- can you confirm or deny the \"label requirement\".Because of the continued confusion, the TSO’s become perpetually irritated with the flying public as a group. They assume the worst of the passengers, feel the need to shout instructions, bark orders like drill instructors, etc., instead of dealing with passengers as individuals. Ordinary civility goes out the window.Is it any wonder that the relationship between the TSA and the flying public can be a little acrimonious? Though the TSO’s are tested frequently for their skill at detecting prohibited items by the TSA, there is little or no accountability for their interpersonal skills. Supervisors seem to pay no attention to the way that passengers are treated. The TSA relies on passenger complaints to deal with heavy handed TSO’s, instead of taking the proactive approach and evaluating the actions of the agency in general and the TSO’s in particular from the point of view of a law-abiding passenger.What about the security camera footage from the checkpoints? Also, I would presume that the checkpoints are also \"wired for sound\". Why not review camera footage to see how the checkpoint experience can be improved?Why doesn't the TSA do some secret shopper missions with the express purpose of looking at the security experience through the eyes of the public?\nI recently had to suffer through boarding a flight at the Orlando Int'l Airport (MCO) a few days after a new policy of pre-sorting passengers into 3 categories was put into place: Family, Casual Traveler, Seasoned Traveller. This might have been a good idea, but its implementation was flawed beyond belief. For example:1) passengers sort themselves. there was no enforcement.2) it was so crowded and there were no TSA employees to help guide the flow of people nor rails to handle the long lines.3) as you get closer to the gate, you do see 3 checkpoints, each manned by 2 i.d. checkers. However, beyond the checkpoint, the lines all mix together again! People just naturally went for the shortest line they can see. I got stuck behind a poor mother traveling with her 3 children.What is the point of segregating passengers at all if you are not going to enforce the separate flows all the way through?Why bother segregating passengers if they end up getting the same treatment anyway? I did not see the TSA assigning more personelle to help the \"Family\" travellers or provide wider entrances or ....It was clear that very little thought went into implementing the idea.\nAnonymous Sandra said... \"Patting down a child is disgraceful.

By the way, are you a/k/a \"screener joe\" who has been ripped a new one so often on this blog because you don't know what you are talking about?Three cheers to Sandra, winstonsmith, Marshall and all those anonymous posters who are fed up with the TSA and are not afraid to say so.\nI have a close relative who works for TSA as a Security Officer.She attributes most of the ill treatment of passengers,poor training,and inconsistancies to the high turn over rate at TSA. According to her, many of her coworkers are brand new or on the way out the door. This would lead me to believe that this is the heart of the problem. There has to be a reason why people would run away from a federal job advertised as a career in such high numbers as reported by many news sources.What's going on behind the scenes is my question.\nWhat ever you do don't post a comment on how much TSA's turnover rate is responsible for the inconsistancies and poor performance of the workforce because it will be censored. The truth hurts I see. Our tax dollars hard at work.\nI have read every single comment on this post. Some were hysterical, especially about passengars pummeling a hijacker. I think it's true. Save one of them having a gun, they wouldn't last with annoyed mothers who raised 6 boys, ticked off business men who's secretary won't come in for private meetings anymore, and the guy who's girlfriend cheated on him.Some are a tad off beat, like the one about children screaming if someone touches them. I think it's important for children to be educated about strangers, but in this case I think it's important for children to know that they parent will be there and that there is a law that says some people get searched and others don't. And that this isn't \"bad\" touching.I just want to say, I hate TSAs. Honestly, I could care less if you're just doing your job. You picked a nasty job. There is a reason I do not have your job. Because I don't want to be the one people are posting comments about on the TSA blog because I am enforcing rules I may not agree with.When I hear them say \"We're just following the rules\" or \"We may not agree with them but we have to follow them\" I feel like saying \"Then get a job that has rules and regulations you agree with\"Same for soldiers. Don't state that you think this \"war\" is ridiculous and then join the Army/Navy/Marines, etc.That being said, no I don't like you, but *I* put up with *you* because I'd rather not sit on my plump rump for sixteen hours just so I can have my very own sammich made by my grammy.I take off my belt, remove my laptop from the case, take off all my outer layers, so I am left in a tank top or t-shirt.On Tuesday, the 25th of March I flew from JFK to SFO. We got non-stop flights with one weeks notice, and checked in online. My boyfriend and I checked our luggage both under my name, that I was checking too. The agent at the counter didn't even look at his boarding pass but required my ID and boarding pass. Fair enough, he didn't have baggage.We get to the security line and I think for sure we'll be singled out for selective screening. I would much rather go through selective screening!1. It's often a shorter and quicker line!2. The TSA personnel are often nicer because they aren't dealing with hoardes of people. Their human interaction is much less.When we weren't selected we moved on. I always wear flip flops to go through security. Recently I found out I suffer from an overarch in my feet and even walking short distances, or short amounts without the support of my shoes is very painful. I recently found very supportive flip flops and was excited, thinking I would be able to wear them and not be in pain (flip flops often aren't supportive and for someone like me, it is painful to wear them). I was told I needed to remove them. My bin had already gone through so they were simple tossed on the belt.And then I had to walk, BAREFOOT on that dirty skeevy floor where all the TSA personnel walk with their chunky black shoes.Ew.I just wanted to wash my feet.Yes, you're just doing your job. Blah blah blah - if you don't have enough faith in the job you do to say \"This is why I am doing this\" and not \"The rules say...\"Don't be a robot. If someone asks \"Why?\" they are most likely genuinely curious because it's something they haven't encountered yet. Answer the, politely, don't act like they are a criminal.My mom get's visible upset and frustrated, and ornery and nasty, when she is singled out for a search or they want to look inside her bag. I believe it's justified, albeit embarassing. One time the woman, while my mom watched, knocked open my mom and brothers pill holder that she had in her carryone and proceeded to unscrewed a bottle of lotion and not rescrew it.M-o-r-o-n. That's uncalled for. And some may say \"That was on TSA official, not all are like that\" but it's those one's that people remember.I smile and keep my mouth shut because I prefer to spend less time traveling to a destination and more time at that destination.\nI would like to see an itemised account of the TSA's expenditures for the lenth of it's existance. Can we say scandal! This is our money paying for this monstrousity.\nI've got a major GRIN based on a news story I just read about a woman being forced or asked to remove her nipple rings with pliers.If the story is true, my reaction (besides being titillated) is that TSA workers went too far, the really funny part of the story is the official response by TSA spokesman Dwayne Baird: \"I'd be really curious to know what this woman had in her nipples. Sometimes they have a chain between their nipples, or a chain between their nipples and their belly button. It would have to be made of heavy metal to be detected.\"Why is this funny to me? At first blush, it seems a case of TMI. But when one thinks about it, one realizes just how much weird information someone like Dwayne is required to know. I'm sure this is a relatively minor example of bizarre human behavior, too.Anyway, if Mr. Baird reads this, thank you for the laugh. You're handling this with grace and wit. If Mr. Baird's superiors read this, give the man a raise!Lastly, when can we expect to see a video by Bob on this subject? I seriously want to know which genital piercings are allowed! =)\nThank goodness my airport has camera's at each screening area so we can no longer be accused of taking items out of bags!!!!!!!!!\nTo the nice Anonymous person who wrote: Three cheers to Sandra, winstonsmith, Marshall and all those anonymous posters who are fed up with the TSA and are not afraid to say so.March 27, 2008 1:40 PMIt is I who thank you for reading and taking your civil rights seriously. It is only when more people start to do the same that we the people will restore actual freedom to our great country. The TSA is only a symptom (albeit a very visible and painful one) of a much larger problem we have in the US. My mom is just about to turn the corner to 70 years old.

To a degree we have some insight into the bottlenecks, issues, and problems that the TSA is facing. It is important that both TSO's and passengers report problems, and work towards resolution. We can only hope that positive dialog will continue.I have been posting anonymously since the beginning, but that is one thing that I can change. I would still like to press for a posted Passenger Bill of Rights.I urge all of you to vote in November. Your voice matters.\nWe use to have TSA zip ties and also TSA cavalar ties but we are no longer able to get them. We loved them so why they are not available any more is sad.\n\"We use to have TSA zip ties and also TSA cavalar ties but we are no longer able to get them. We loved them so why they are not available any more is sad.\"Lets work on getting them back. With RFID tags if necessary. It is a TSA issue, but affects your credibility, secure check-in baggage and theft is really serious issue with passengers.\nI recently returned home from overseas thru DTW, most of the TSA employees were polite enough except one who was so rude and crude that anywhere else they would have been fired. If I was not in a hurray to catch a connecting flight I would have asked to see a supervisor. What happen to the comment cards that were available? TSA you need to train your employees to be polite also and remember you are goverment employees paid by the people so technicaly being a tax paying citizen you work for me.\nI'd be really curious to know what this woman had in her nipples. Sometimes they have a chain between their nipples, or a chain between their nipples and their belly button. It would have to be made of heavy metal to be detected.Mr. Baird's statement is quite accurate. Unless these piercings were of a heavy gauge -- and based upon the photo I've seen in the media where the woman and her lawyer demonstrated the removal with a mannequin, they apparently were not -- they shouldn't have set off the wand. I speak from experience here, as I have the same piercings (and one below the belt, so to speak). I used to give the TSA screeners a friendly warning before they'd wand me -- just because I realize this type of thing makes some people uncomfortable -- but I stopped because the jewelry simply would never trip the metal detector. It's really been a non-issue.\n\"When we weren't selected we moved on. I always wear flip flops to go through security.

The public is angry because of the extreme lack of transparency, inconsistent policies, and a complete lack of any and all civil liberties once you walk into that TSA checkpoint. The bad guys have already won. Thanks to you, Big Brother. Glad to see you treated this woman fairly, without unnecessarily invading her privacy (hint: sarcasm)Nipple rings? Come on now, you can't be serious. News flash: terrorists are not currently and will never use nipple rings as a weapon. What really gets me is the oh-so-common line \"We can't tell you, national security and all.\" Half of the general public would be satisfied at this point if the TSA just released some honest to goodness information and not more doublespeak. I will admit, I think this blog is an amazing idea - but it is still in a sad state of affairs. How many times have questions been asked and responded to without any real content being contained in the so-called answer? You can practically hear the TSA squirming in their seats as they dodge providing complete answers to many if not most questions asked here. I would love to hear someone try and argue why security through obscurity is a valid model in the TSA when it has proven a failed concept in every other application ever imagined? Keeping secrets doesn't provide any ACTUAL security... it only provides the illusion of security. Of course given the ability of many people to succumb to illusions and doublespeak, how can it possibly surprise me anymore that we as a society tacitly accept this thought process?\nSomeone really ought to officially inform the body modification community that body piercings are not prohibited items. I have worn large gauge steel and titanium nipple and genital piercings for many years and have passed through many US and foreign airports without ever being detected by the metal detectors. Unless she had little razor blade jewelry, you really need to explain yourselves over this one.\nThe worst part about my service in Iraq was not my time there, but the trip home. Thanks, TSA. Upon leaving Fort Dix, I had to take a commercial flight from the Philly airport to get back home on the West coast. Upon reaching the security gate, a Army COL. in uniform who was a Silver Star awardee, was being made to empty all his pockets; he complained that he was not a terrorist, but the screener cut him short and snapped at him \"You military folks ARE the terrorists!\" I received similar treatment, and when checking my briefcase, her assistant dumped it upside down, mixing up the paperwork and damaging some items in there. The TSA lady told me \"If you want to catch your flight, you're going to do nothing about it.\" I ended up having to put my stuff away without the screeners help, which only delayed me. Several men of Arabic descent behind me were able to pass through without even being given a second look-over by the screener (scared of profiling?). When I got to San Diego, I checked out of my temporary command, and went to fly back home to Seattle a week later from San Diego airport. I was in uniform at the ticket counter, when a TSA official had me step out of line with my seabag, and in front of the other passengers, empty out the entire seabag, whilst she inspected it's contents. She asked for my military ID, because she said my name was on some sort of 'Terrorist Watch List' and she had to look up to see if I was that person (I wasn't). I was told I have the same name as someone else on that list, but there was nothing I could do about it because \"That's just the way it is\" as she put it. So now I'm 'flagged' for special treatment everytime I fly! Every TSA person I talked to on my return home from Iraq made it clear directly or suggestively, that they had a problem with me and some of my fellow travellers for no other reason than that we were military personnel. I remained courteous and polite to the TSA folks even though I got nothing but attitude and unprofessional behavior from them in return! This type of discrimination against military personnel by TSA screeners happens every day in our airports. This is how TSA welcomes our heroes home.I filed a complaint on the TSA website about my mistreatment over a year ago, and they have not bothered to respond to my complaint, or even apologize. That only shows TSA knows about it, and they care to do NOTHING about the problem, otherwise they would have responded to my complaint!\nNipple piercing? Are you serious? This has to be a hoax. There is no way the TSA is this bad.http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8VM3DT00&show_article=1&image=largeWhat is next. I have to remove the metal plate on my hip?\nLitigation is the answer. Sue 'em more. Get names from badges and, by god, sue 'em. If they lose enough bling in court they'll come around to acting like humans again.\nSome snippets posted on FlyerTalk recently:\"So this morning I'm flying CO from NJ (EWR) to Denver, & I packed a backpack instead of my normal roller. To deal w/ liquid regulations I bought plastic bottles @ Walmart & carry my own shampoo, shaving cream etc. Toothpaste however I've always just bought smaller sized tubes & tossed it in the bag. This morning, I failed to bring my plastic bag & had to put the toothpaste in my dob kit. Of course they pull out my toothpaste telling me it's over the limit - TSA agent stated the limit is 3.5oz - TSA website says 3oz by volume which I knew, & my toothpaste was w/i that limit. I asked the agent if she knew what the limit represented, volume or weight..... blank stare. I asked her again pointing out that although the weight was greater than 3.5 oz, the volume was closer to 2... blank stare & a repeat of \"the limit is 3.5oz.\" In the end I walked away, but just another example of the TSA's utter incompetence.\"From a recent Patrick Smith column:\"In Latin America, for example, our TSA requires local security personnel to set up gateside screening tables exclusively for flights to the United States. After passing through the standard metal detector and x-ray station, which does not enforce a liquids ban, passengers get in line to have their carry-on bags hand-searched for any oversized containers. Those headed elsewhere are exempt from such nonsense. These gateside checks are not only tedious, but useless. In South America recently I was sitting in a crowded gate and witnessed something hilarious -- or maybe sad is the better term: At the screening tables, a handful of contract guards were ransacking carry-ons, but there was no frisking or pat-downs of passengers themselves. So, as the line snaked forward in agonizing slow-motion, people would simply reach into their bags, remove any toothpaste or other personal effects they'd rather not forfeit, and slip them into their pockets!Over the past six years I have written upwards of twenty columns on the airport security and the TSA. Through it all I've found myself searching for a word -- a single word that might possibly encapsulate the nonsense that we go through, from the pointy-object confiscations to the shoe removals to the childish folly I just described. Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, there is no single word that can simultaneously account for things wasteful, pointless, humiliating and immature. Neither is there a word to describe the level frustration some of us feel when we are demanded, at the risk of confrontation and hollering, to treat obviously silly rules with unmatched seriousness.What we're dealing with is, to some extent, human nature. At this point the TSA is the kind of self-perpetuating beast that inevitably results when a bureaucracy is granted lots of power and little actual purpose. But also, we have also spent six years living in a state of institutional denial. Our government, willfully or otherwise, refuses to admit a basic and irrefutable premise: that the attacks of September 11th were not, in fact, caused by a failure of airport security.\"Re: episode where woman was forced to remove her body piercings with a pair of pliars. Rather than address the issue directly, the TSA continues to maintain that its screeners are properly trained and further adds to the fear-mongering in order to justify its existence:\"TSA is actively investigating Ms. Hamlin's allegations to ensure procedures were followed appropriately. Our security officers are well-trained to screen individuals with body piercings in sensitive areas with dignity and respect while ensuring a high level of security.TSA is well aware of terrorists' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body, therefore we have a duty to the American public to resolve any alarm that we discover. Incidents of female terrorists hiding explosives in sensitive areas are on the rise all over the world. This scenario must be addressed at our nation's airports.To the right is a prototype training device that TSA will use to simulate a bra bomb in training and testing its officers.\"A comment on suggested \"overreactions\", i.e., child screaming while being patted down:Any attempt to change a bad situation, such as this country is dealing with at this time, needs to start with outrageous actions in order to garner the attention of the general population, in the case of the TSA, the \"SHEEPLE\" who just go along with the agency's demands. Most know the rules serve no purpose, but most people are scared to death to speak out. (Thankfully, the phrase \"anything for security\" is heard less and less these days.)In order to embolden the general flying public to speak out, we must ourselves be willing to say in a very loud and a very clear voice: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!\nAs a former TSO, let me help clarify the mystery of liquids, gels, aerosols, etc. This information is available at the TSA.gov website and I will include the link. It seems that many passengers have forgotten much of the science they learned in school, but . . . if you can POUR it, PUMP it, SQUEEZE it, SPREAD it,SMEAR it, SPRAY it or SPILL it; then you are carrying a liquid, gel, or aerosol and those items are subject to the 3-1-1 restrictions. Link -- http://www.tsa.gov/assets/pdf/311-insert.pdfIn general, TSO's are not trying to be difficult, but they are required to follow the standard operating procedures.\n\"We use to have TSA zip ties and also TSA cavalar ties\"Cavalar???Is that anything like Corbomite? (Ask the nearest Trekker if you're not familiar with that substance.)Presumably you mean Kevlar, which would make a darned strong zip tie. Interesting that the TSA did make an effort at one point to resecure bags they searched, but no longer.\nTSA IS A JOKE. All they do is make it more expensive and more of a hassle to travel. Air travel is not fun any more. It is not any more safe than it was before 911.\nTexas woman claims TSA forced nipple ring removalLOS ANGELES — A Texas woman who claims she was forced to remove a nipple ring with pliers in order to board an airplane called Thursday for an apology by federal security agents and a civil rights investigation.Hamlin said she was trying to board a flight from Lubbock to Dallas on Feb. 24 when she was scanned by a Transportation Security Administration agent after passing through a larger metal detector without problems.The female TSA agent used a handheld detector that beeped when it passed in front of Hamlin's chest, the Dallas-area resident said.Hamlin said she told the woman that she was wearing nipple piercings. The female agent then called over her male colleagues, one of whom said she would have to remove the body piercings, Hamlin claimed.Hamlin said she could not remove them and asked if she could instead display her pierced breasts in private to the female agent. But several other male officers told her she could not board her flight until the jewelry was removed, she said.She was taken behind a curtain and managed to remove one bar-shaped nipple piercing but had trouble with the second, a ring.\"Still crying, she informed the TSA officer that she could not remove it without the help of pliers, and the officer gave a pair to her,\" said Hamlin's attorney, Gloria Allred, reading from a letter she sent Thursday to the director of the TSA's Office of Civil Rights and Liberties. Allred is a well-known Los Angeles lawyer who often represents high-profile claims.\nI work at MSP airport. So I travel often. I cant honestly say that I have had a lot of good security experiences with the TSA. The last time my husband and I flew, I was harrassed by the TSA agents for wearing a button-up hoodie that they were convinced was a jacket. They tried to force me to take it off in front of everyone that was also waiting in line to go through checkpoint. Even though I let 3 male and 1 female TSA agents know that I did not have anything on under my sweatshirt they insisted it come off NOW! They were incredibe rude. The worst part of it was when I told one of the male TSA agents that I did not have a shirt on under my sweatshirt he smiled. They are incredibly rude and have no sense of customer service. They Just dont care!\nI'm confused by the \"squeeze and smear\" comment. I can squeeze a block of cheese or a bean bag. I can squeeze my backpack. I can squeeze an empty plastic bottle. I can smear crayons and pencils onto paper -- that's how they work! These are all solids, aren't they? What about candles? And chocolate bars?And technically, some would consider glass (eye glasses) to be not solid. Look it up.So do all of these have to go in that tiny bag as well?And pens, which do contain liquid, do not need to go into the bag.This is why the general population is confused. Lipstick is a solid at room temperature and so is peanut butter (Google it) and therefore does not need to go into the baggie.Maybe we need a chemistry professor at each TSA checkpoint to confirm whether various objects are solid or liquid. Or maybe a printed list at each checkpoint that the TSA can point to. If it's not on the list, and you cannot pour it, it's not subject to the 3-1-1 policy.\n\"You military folks ARE the terrorists!\" There are liars, and dam liars and you are one. Philly TSO!\nWe flew from Milwaukee to Phoenix and the screeners in Milwaukee have no respect for personal belongings that have to be screened. They were unnecessarily rough with my son's expensive, delicate camera which he had placed carefully in one of the bins to go through the X-ray. The agent made an exasperated noise as if we weren't supposed to put the camera bag in a little gray bin. Where, pray tell, are the instructions for what goes into the bins and what doesn't? There aren't any posted, and not everyone flies on a regular basis. We fly once a year, perhaps twice a year, and this kind of rudeness and rough treatment of expensive equipment is unwarranted. There is not one sign that states what we need to remove and what we need to leave on...from shoes to jewelry. We've had agents refuse to hand-inspect exposed film; when we have had to dump water out of a Nalgene bottle, there's no place to dump it but into a trash can. Why? This whole security routine is nothing new by this time, yet every time I have had to traverse its labyrinth, there's no improvement in the communications, no improvement in the efficiency, and highly variable attitudes on the part of the screeners. In Phoenix, the screeners were uniformly polite, kind, willing to make the process go as smoothly as possible, and were more than willing to answer questions for us as well as hand-screen exposed film. Every one of our possessions was handled carefully and we were treated kindly. This was not true in Milwaukee. We flew into Indianapolis and found the same incredibly rude attitude on the part of the TSA team there. They wouldn't budge to put a sign on a vending machine that was taking money and not dispensing water....\"not our job.\" These people were standing (sorry, leaning) around with nothing to do while we struggled to find a piece of paper, pen and possibly tape to post a sign that the machine was out of order. This was within 3 feet of the TSA people. Is kindness prohibited? To a person, every TSA employee that we encountered in Indianapolis was surly, rude, and unhelpful. Not a good first impression of Hoosier Hospitality. As far as shipping items to yourself, that's impossible. There is no way to do that when you find that you cannot transport something. By that time, you have no option but to hand the item over to be dumped in the trash. The kiosks for shipping are well-hidden...I looked in Phoenix, Indiapolis, and Milwaukee. As a parent of a child with Celiac Disease, I am constantly worried that we won't be able to travel with the food that my son needs. It's expensive, cannot be checked, and cannot be replaced easily ANYWHERE, least of all in the \"secure boaring area.\" I have comforted myself with the hope that I could possibly ship the food home, but that's not possible from what I can see at the airports. So, TSA, we need uniformity of rules, communication of rules, kindness, clarity, respect for our belongings (no matter what age the passenger), and follow-through on what you tell the public (make the mailing kiosks visible and accessible in every airport). How can we comply when we don't even know what we're expected to do?!\nWell this should be interesting. I've been following the articles written about the TSA since 9/11. All they have done is provide more fact to Homeland Security and the bush babies that they don't know what they’re doing, don't care and someone is pocketing the money that may make a difference. I cannot believe the ignorance of the TSA at airports and the attitude of superiority these junkie monkeys display. COMMON SENSE is not in any of their vocabulary. I'm guessing someone else filled out their employment applications. It's like Homeland Security went out and hired every thug they could find, slipped them some money, put them on the bush dole and said hey just do this and if this happens, act like a \"jack\" that never had an intelligent thought in their life. COMMON SENSE. The latest posting... TSA has posted that they \"followed procedure\" at the Dallas airport with the poor woman and the nipple ring. If any of the agents had any kind of decency or COMMON SENSE they easily could have checked the woman's piercing and not have HARMED her in anyway. But no, the female TSA agent, showing no sense on her own (she deserves the exact same treatment at every airport for the rest of her life), asks a bunch of \"jack\" males who instead of using COMMON SENSE used their nether regions and FORCED her to hurt herself when a look was all that was needed. It's like the hill, the airports need to be cleaned out of the ignorants as soon as possible and decent people with common sense need to be paid well and establish real protocols that they are RESPONSIBLE for. The TSA lawyers are constantly answering questions with we have establish this or that policy, it just isn't in effect yet, but since we established it, we did our job. NO, YOU DID NOT. I think every TSA agent should be forced to go to another airport, lead to the head \"jack\" and see what it feels like. People, if you can't do your job, if you're some sicko enjoying the torment of Americans, if you don't like your job, if you're stealing from your job - stop and get out; YOU ARE NOT WANTED. And if you stealing directly from Americans like Homeland Security and the bush babies, I hope your job gets cut, airports shut down because you don't deserve a bailout with your shitty service, and all of you can't find a job for a 2 years. TSA agents, hope you like being a bush baby Americans.\nI travel extensively through the US and all over the world and i have to admit my experiences with security in US airports is inconsistent. I can't imagine it is a fun job by any means but I have to say that it would be a better experience for all involved if the screeners realized that MOST travellers are innocent and not terrorists. A smile, a courteous manner, a sense of humour would go a long way in getting people through the screening process without feeling like they are in the movie midnight express!I am okay with high levels of security if it makes sense and is consistent. I find the whole no liquids thing ridiculous. I am concur that peanut butter and lip glass are far from explosive. I would also appreciate it that if you have to pat me down you ask my permission first and do so in a gentle, respectful manner. TSA employees would be wise to remember this especially if you are patting down, women, children and elderly. Think about how you would want your mother to be treated. I have been manhandled by TSA agents in both Hawaii and North Carolina airports.I would also show more patience and understanding if some of the security measures made sense. I understand the need to screen laptops and electronics and am happy to oblige. I am also more than happy to take off my shoes, i always travel with shoes that are easy to remove. What doesn't make a lick of sense to me is to screen the bottoms of my bare feet (Hawaii airport). If you can clearly see that there is nothing on the bottom of my feet nor are there any fresh surgical scars that would suggest something had been implanted there. Why waste my time making me go through that only to be sent on to be manhandled by the next screener? I have been dying to ask that question for ages. (BTW this happens every single time i go through the Hawaii airport)At the end of the day i think you would find the general public is grateful for the attention to security but it would behoove the TSA to spend some time with their screeners to teach them how to not only maintain homeland security but do so respectfully and kindly without evoking the ire of the public. Consistency across all airports would also go along way to building confidence with the public. An innocent person shouldn't come away from security feeling, violated, humiliated or like a criminal. The public needs to understand the role of TSA and be prepared to adhere to their regulations. They need to anticipate and prepare for screening in advance to make things go more smoothly by getting there early, being patient, being prepared to remove shoes, electronics etc. and remembering it is for everyone's safety.\nIt has been scientifically proven that an observer will not find what they are looking for accurately if they do not find it fairly frequently (see Wolfe JM, Horowitz TS, Kenner NM. Cognitive psychology: rare items often missed in visual searches. Nature 2005;435:439-40).Considering that, the lack of science behind TSA screening methods and the distractions the officers have (assuring that liquids, laptops, shoes, etc all follow regulation screening procedures), I seriously doubt the ability of this whole process to protect us.The system, however, is a major victory for terrorists, since it created the havoc and mania they always wanted.\nRegarding the occurance with the woman in texas required to remove her nipple piercings prior to entrance into the airport's secure area.Now, i fully realize the reasoning and necesity of identifying all detector alarms, however this is a case where TSA has overstepped its bounds, and has shown a clear abuse of power. Yet they claim the incident was handled properly as noted in the update on tsa's website.As quoted:March 28, 2008It appears that the Transportation Security Officers involved properly followed procedures in that incident.Yet, if the news article is accurate The woman involved identified them and offered to privatly display them to another female TSA officer, which was refused.She said she heard male TSA agents snickering as she took out the ring. This is proper procedure? She was scanned again and was allowed to board even though she still was wearing a belly button ring.A belly button ring is less dangeous than nipple piercings?Since, i see nothing in TSA's list of prohibited items relating to this sort of jewelery as being not allowed was she then allowed to keep them or required to dispose of them?This entire incident is not only unprofessional, but excedes any authority allowed by security regulations, once it was determined she possessed no dangerous or prohibited items. It also raises the question(s) of what adornments then are allowable?Is it Because of her body being pierced? if so then why was the belly button ring allowed? What then about ear rings that are inserted in ear piercings? or some of the other piercings seen today such as nose, lips, eyebrows? Are only specific adornments at question here?This then brings another question to mind. What about a womans bra that contains underwires, and metal adjustment or fastening devices? Is a woman then going to be required to remove her bra because said metal is hidden?And whats next? \"I'm sorry sir (or ma'am) you'll have to remove that artificial joint (knee replacement for example) we cant allow that.\" or \"we're sorry sir, the zipper in your trousers is too long, you'll have to leave your pants here.\"Its time TSA takes responsibility for its actions, and if a person is informed they are in violation with a prohibited item, then TSA should if necessary be required, and ready to document that with written copies of said violation.Sadly this appears to be nothing more than abuse of power on the part of the TSA officer(s), as well as a lack of understanding of regulations in general, and i sincerely hope this woman pursues this through legal channels as necessary.Based on personal experience, this isn't a totally isolated incident either. Firsthand experience with my spouse, who has BOTH hips replaced, (and again i fully understand the necessity of identifying unknown alarms) When even a pat down discloses no hidden property some airport security employees are at a loss about what to do. The worst airport for this we have been in is Memphis. and on more than one occasion we have been detained long enough to almost miss a flight which was 2 hours in advance of our arrival.Denver on the other hand, seems to have a good handle on problems such as joint replacements and has a procedure in place to deal with these issues.\n1. I have a high-level security clearance.2. I am a contractor for DHS (since I am not on site in DC, though, I have no badging).3. I have a Registered Traveler pass(good only at a few airports).I think it would be much more efficient - not to mention a good PR gig - if government or contract employees with security clearances were granted some sort of TSA clearance or consistent access to a speed lane. I have no idea on the number, but I am sure that would speed probably hundreds of thousands of people through security lines.\nI travel almost weekly, and it irritates me to no end to have an arrogant, ill-trained, ill-mannered screener treat me like I am something he scraped off his shoe.\nAnonymous said...\"You military folks ARE the terrorists!\" There are liars, and dam liars and you are one. Philly TSO!March 28, 2008 12:39 PMThank you Anonymous for serving my purposes! But I wasn't lying, it really happened. You see, the fact that you were able to make that baseless imflammatory comment and the TSA Blog Moderator(s) DID NOT see a problem with it and posted it, only proves my assumption (posted in my first comment) that TSA has a problem with military folks like myself. Otherwise, they would not have condoned the above comment like they did at 12:39PM.I can only imagine what kind of treatment they find acceptable for the civilian community? If they screen for the bad guys at the airport as well as they moderate their discussion board as shown above...The we should ALL be worried!\nI have been reading this blog off and on since its inception. As a Transportation Security Officer for almost six years, I have worked in the smallest airports in Alaska to the largest airports on the east coast. I am amazed every day, of the things that happen and that I see. Certainly, I am concerned about the possibility of a terrorist getting through the TSA checkpoint and onto a plane with an IED. However, I am just as concerned, if not more, by the whiny sucky bottle babies, that write the majority of these posts. It seems most of these people have been spoon fed their entire lives and who knows what they have been fed. Granted, some of the concerns brought up are valid, but by and large... bogus. People, please get your facts straight or at least attempt to do some research before you start throwing stones. I do not agree with a few of the procedures that we must follow, but I do not have a suggestion to repair them and I have not seen anyone offer up any realistic alternatives. Getting through the screening process is only as difficult as you make it.\nAt which Airports have they said they will limit the amounts of Medical items? If the medical item is over the 3.4oz limit and is a liquid/gel/etc then it should be simply tested and go from there. And as for them being poorly trained...do you know how much they have to go through for each person? Especially that guy stuck on the x-ray machine? He's gotta scan each image and look for components of an IED in a matter of seconds. I'm sure he'd love to take longer but we, the passangers, start to complain over it takeing to long without remembering that they are being thorough for our benefit. And as for them being rude or what have you, I feel we should cut them a bit of slack. Of course they are professionals and should act better but they are people too. They will bite back like any of us would in our own professions.\nPost a Comment", "id": "<urn:uuid:eaae7080-0f3a-4063-9c01-3205c7d71470>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.tsa.gov/2008/01/gripes-grins-part-2.html?showComment=1206090360000", "date": "2013-05-18T07:26:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9740747213363647, "token_count": 46263, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean;Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean;Noise", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "More than tracing the footsteps of Shaw and Yeats around Bloomsbury, spending an hour or two in conversation over a well-poured pint is a quintessential London-Irish experience. A “good” Irish pub has a certain elusive quality. It doesn’t try too hard to announce its heritage. It is a space that welcomes, warms, and nurtures good conversation.\nWaxy O’Connor’s – in the heart of the West End – is a cavernous pub that still manages to feel inviting. Order your pint and Tayto crisps, then choose a spot according to your taste: nestle beside the fire in the Cottage Bar, take a pew within the gothic décor of the Church Bar, or explore the fairytale atmosphere of the Tree Room, where you can marvel beneath its massive trunks and branches.\nWith its mix of church architecture, painted panelled ceilings and tiled floors, Waxy O’Connor’s provides a unique and quirky setting for its loyal, lively clientele. If you’re looking for a smaller, simpler experience, try Waxy’s Little Sister, around the corner on Wardour Street. Armchairs, sofas and an open fire set the perfect tone for a quick catch-up pint or a chilled-out evening.\nFor something completely different, The Irish Club is an elegant members’ club that welcomes guests and non-members. Located at 2-4 Tudor Street, the 1903 building previously housed The Institute of Journalists and was later converted to barristers’ chambers. Now tastefully restored, it offers a sophisticated sanctuary from the bustle of Blackfriars.\nThe Club’s Jameson Bar reportedly houses the largest collection of Irish whiskeys in London. If whiskey isn’t your tipple, there’s ample choice of wines, cocktails and beers to enjoy against a backdrop of contemporary Irish art. (At the time of writing, there are more Graham Knuttels than you could shake a stick at.)\nThe secret of a good Irish bar lies in its atmosphere. Whether its customers are reading the papers on a still afternoon, or roaring encouragement to the Six Nations, it’s a space that remains dependable, recognisable, despite its different moods. Whatever it is, you can’t bottle it.\nDo you have more Irish recommendations?

{"text": "Published by Peggy on 13 Aug 2009 at 04:17 pm\nAre you leveraging the potential of volunteers within your organization? Volunteers are a wonderful asset, bringing skill sets you may not have, as well as, new perspective and practices. We share some of our experience recruiting and making the best use of volunteers.\nWiserEarth would have never succeeded over the years without all the amazing volunteers that have joined our global effort and brought their best to the project. One example is the WiserEarth editors’ group, a buzzing hive of activity driven largely by volunteers, now a mainstay of the site, but this was not always so. Late last year, WiserEarth’s Chief Editor Wibowo Sulistio, contacted volunteers and interns who had worked with us in the past to co-define roles for them to serve within the community. Since that time, it has become self-sustaining and community-driven. Wiserearth Editor volunteers have assisted in e-mailing organizations, created a community newsletter, greeted newcomers, helped to keep the directory current, moderated postings, and brainstormed further ways to improve the site.\nIn March this year, Timonie Hood, contacted me through WiserEarth. She shared her interest in sustainable building and and her passion for learning about social media. During a subsequent call, she mentioned that she was working for the EPA in the San Francisco office and was taking a leadership program that allowed her to volunteer full-time for an organization for a period of four months. You can guess what happened next. Timonie has now been with us for three months as our social media volunteer. She not only succeeded in helping us strengthen our online social media strategy but she also discovered new tools we started using for outreach: “Volunteering at WiserEarth has really opened my eyes to global collaboration and great volunteer opportunities. I definitely plan on continuing to volunteer here after my rotation ends.”.\nThose two examples are two among many stories of individuals that have made a true difference within our organization. Over the years, we have learned quite a lot. To summarize, here are a few tips that have made a huge difference for us:\n- Ask for help: If you don’t ask, people will not know you need help! You can simply add a small section on your website about your needs, and spread the word through social media. Hey, did you know we are currently looking for a volunteer that can turn wireframe mockups into interactive, clickable HTML pages? Also feel free to use WiserEarth’s free job listings to get your word out.\n- Clearly state your need: Define your opportunity clearly, you should then have a better sense of the skill set needed and more likely the right candidate will apply.\n- Create a SMART workplan: Don’t waste your precision volunteer time. Design a mutually beneficial workplan from the start with SMART goals.\n- Allow for recognition: Are you both formally and informally telling your volunteer about his/her impact on your organization? A mixture of both formal recognition (emails, lunch, meetings) and informal (notes, giving away goodies) is important.\n- Take the time to appreciate: Ensure that the volunteer feels appreciated, has a satisfying experience, and feels like he/she made a contribution towards the mission of the organization as well as found opportunities for personal and knowledge growth. Much easier to do if s/he has SMART goals!\nIf you have any volunteer experiences you would like to share, please contact us! Or better yet, if you would like to volunteer send me an email at peggy[at]wiserearth.org.\n|If you enjoyed this post, please consider leaving a comment or subscribing to the feed to have future articles delivered to your feed reader.|\nLeave a Reply", "id": "<urn:uuid:bc835bc2-026d-488e-a346-0e09d7a94c6c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.wiser.org/volunteering-that-works/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9614104628562927, "token_count": 793, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}
{"text": "Welcome to the world!By\nAfter several years of feet dragging, I’ve taken a bite of the poison Apple and bought an iPhone. Although I’m still not sure which side of the “work vs. expensive toy” fence it will fall on, it should help out in several areas of my personal and professional life.\nOf course to do that, I have to know how to use it and thus far, all it has done is tease me from afar. After closing my eyes on the AT&T web site Friday afternoon and clicking “Complete Purchase” (or whatever the button said), I expected – because I was told by AT&T and Apple it could be 5-10 business days until they shipped it – to have a wait ahead of me.\nAnd I was cool with that.\nThat coolness went away when the e-mail came announcing the shipping of the phone. “It will get here someday” was quickly replaced by a neurotic rotation back to the AT&T web site to check the status of my order. By mid-day Saturday, my new toy was sitting in a warehouse in Indianapolis and there was nothing I could do but wait. Seriously, I drive past a FedEx warehouse every day, probably the same one holding my phone hostage, and there was nothing I could do about it for two whole days.\nFinally, today arrived and the phone was marked “out for delivery” and the race was on. The delivery estimate was for 3 p.m. and I had to leave for work at 3:30. By 2 o’clock and no phone, I checked the FedEx site again. “Incorrect Address.” Panic. Calm. Phone calls.\nTo FedEx’s credit, they were very cool on the phone, called back twice to double check our address and at 3:20, the doorbell rang. I’d have better off if they had missed me by 10 minutes.\nI had enough time to open the box, look at the parts, plug it in and leave. In the meantime, my wife ordered a new BlackBerry at the same time, it was delivered in the mail this morning and she has been busy playing and configuring all day. Such a tease.\nAll I know now is this better live up to the hype, because the last two days have felt like 200. (Okay, a little exaggeration there.)\nThis meandering story of an idiot waiting for his new phone was really a call for help. What do I do now that I actually have the phone? How does a 36-year-old web guy go about best using a shiny new iPhone 4? A call out on Facebook has yielded two parts sarcastic ridicule and 1 part help, but I have access to Indianapolis, and darn it, I’m going to use it!\nApps, cases, gadgets, whatever, help me out Indy!

{"text": "As an investment strategy, “Stay Home” has mostly outperformed “Go Global” this year. It may continue to do so in 2013. However, I’m starting to get cabin fever. It may be time to get out a little bit and see the world. Here is what I am seeing:\n(1) China. China’s new leaders, who will be formally appointed at the Communist Party Congress during November, are likely to spend lots of money to revive economic growth when they take charge in March. Before then, the People's Bank of China is likely to avert a hard landing by continuing to ease monetary policy.\nThe latest data out of China suggest that the country’s economic growth may be bottoming. M2 rose 14.8% y/y during September, up from a recent low of 12.4% during January 2012. The CPI inflation rate, which recently peaked at 6.5% during July 2011, seems to be stabilizing around 2% over the past three months. Exports edged up during September, but have stalled in recent months. On the other hand, September's PPI for industrial products fell 3.6% y/y, the weakest since October 2009.\n(2) India. Over the past month, India’s government unveiled a series of reform initiatives long demanded by investors and business leaders frustrated by years of policy inaction in New Delhi. They include lifting the bar on foreign investment in the airline, insurance, pensions, and retail sectors. That’s already pumping up the financial markets. The next step is expected to be a roadmap for cutting the fiscal deficit.\nThe Bombay Sensex stock price index has rallied smartly on the government’s reform announcement. It is now up 20.8% ytd, about twice as much as the 9.9% increase in the MSCI World index. During September, India’s M-PMI remained flat at 52.8, while the NM-PMI rose to 55.8.\n(3) Indonesia. In Southeast Asia’s largest economy, September car sales jumped 28% y/y back to near-record monthly numbers, driven by a rising middle class and low interest rates. Carmakers are expanding their Indonesian production. Their exports surged 58% on an annual basis in the year through August. On the other hand, exports and imports fell the most in three years in August, suggesting weakening third-quarter growth. Yet the World Bank forecasts that Indonesia’s real GDP will grow 6.1% in 2012 and 6.3% in 2013.\nThe Jakarta Composite stock price index is at a record high and up 12.8% ytd.\n(4) Brazil. The Brazilian central bank reduced interest rates for the 10th straight time Wednesday to spark local growth amid concerns about a prolonged global slump. The bank cut its benchmark Selic interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a record low 7.25% and signaled the end to a cycle of cuts that started in August 2011. The central bank's rate-setting committee was divided, with five directors in favor of the cut and three directors voting to hold interest rates steady.\n(5) Mexico. The IMF estimates Brazil has an economy twice the size of Mexico's at $2.4 trillion, but Nomura’s economists predict that the gap could disappear by 2022 if Mexico grows at the top end of their forecast range and Brazil at the low end. New Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto aims to lift annual economic growth to 6% by overhauling Mexico's labor market, state-run oil sector, and tax base. Mexico’s IPC stock price index is up 12.4% ytd, well ahead of Brazil’s 3.3% gain.\nToday's Morning Briefing: Beantown. (1) The weather in Boston. (2) Blankfein says avoiding fiscal cliff would be very bullish. (3) Second Recovery is underway. (4) Foreclosures at five-year low. (5) Earned income at record high. (6) Rising stock and home prices boosting confidence. (7) Lots of applications to export US oil and LNG. (8) Tax receipts at cyclical high. (9) Time to Go Global? (10) China may be bottoming.

The city's largest and oldest open-air market - it opened in 1917 - currently houses more than 45 food stalls but only 30 are occupied. According to the LA Times, owner Adele Yellin, along with consultants Joseph Shuldiner and Kevin West, wants to change that.\nShuldiner, who founded the Institute of Domestic Technology and oversees the fantastically funky Altadena Farmers Market, and West, of Saving the Season, will be instrumental in finding new chefs and entrepreneurs, including bread bakers, coffee roasters and retail, cheesemongers, fishmongers and butchers.

{"text": "A widely-viewed YouTube of Peter Schiff, the president of brokerage firm Euro Pacific Capital, has been making noise this week. Schiff had been predicting the real estate meltdown and credit crunch in the U.S. since 2006, long before anyone else understood the problems that were threatening the U.S. economy.\nSchiff was finally vindicated when a YouTube of his multiple TV appearance on CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg TV and other major U.S. networks, started gaining in popularity this week. In it, Schiff is seen debating with so-called experts, including Arthur Laffer of Laffer Investments, who were bullish on the stock market and the economy.\nTrouble is, these \"experts\" didn't have the understanding of economics that Schiff\nhas. The bearish Schiff was right on most of his predictions, including the housing meltdown, the liquidity problem and the recession (which he said would actually be a depression). And he had the guts to go on national TV to debate with arrogant analysts who belittlingly dismissed his arguments without even trying to understand what he was explaining.\nSo, what is Schiff predicting will happen next? He sees Asia as the next place for growth and says the Asian market will experience a tremendous boom. While this shouldn't come as a shocker, his reasons may surprise some. Schiff says that Asia's strong manufacturing sector and its ability to produce goods is its major strength. Schiff also sees the U.S. dollar, which has been gaining against 15 major currencies in the last few months, become weaker again and \"fall like a stone.\" The Chinese Yuan is the only currency that has been gaining against the dollar as of late.\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/claim/cjejms2tuq\" rel=\"me\">Technorati Profile</a>", "id": "<urn:uuid:a16d4b46-a769-41ea-8cb1-33aa1e49910e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogarchive.hillandknowlton.com/blogs/cedricvanhaver/default.aspx", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9796845316886902, "token_count": 376, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

The loss of synchronicity with the beauty of this world because of sensory deprivation causes a tremendous sorrow which cannot be expressed. Such is the agony of an artist who can no longer see or that of a musician who can no longer hear. Beethoven, a legend then and now in the world of mortals left us with immortal musical compositions, some of which were composed even when he was completely deaf. He was in indescribable agony for having been denied the pleasures of hearing his own compositions. His life was dwelt in constant pain over this sensory deprivation from the passion which he most embraced, music. In the now famous letter which he sent his brothers named Heiligenstadt Testament, he writes:\n\"O how harshly was I repulsed by the doubly sad experience of my bad hearing,...but what a humiliation when one stood beside me and heard a flute in the distance and I heard nothing, or someone heard the shepherd singing and again I heard nothing, such incidents brought me to the verge of despair, but little more and I would have put an end to my life - only art it was that withheld me, ah it seemed impossible to leave the world until I had produced all that I felt called upon me to produce, and so I endured this wretched existence - truly wretched, an excitable body which a sudden change can throw from the best into the worst state ... O men, when some day you read these words, reflect that you did me wrong and let the unfortunate one comfort himself and find one of his kind who despite all obstacles of nature yet did all that was in his power to be accepted among worthy artists and men\".\nThe above notes of personal grief were written in 1802, a time when the biological body had no choice but to accept what was bestowed unto it by random replications of genetic material and the quality of society. Now, in the year 2007, two hundred and five years later, the modern Beethoven has a ray of hope.", "id": "<urn:uuid:964fc626-e8b7-4ae1-9425-419e193e0da2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogcritics.org/scitech/article/cochlear-cyborgs/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:52:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9804332852363586, "token_count": 509, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Jamie Linden, perhaps best known as the screenwriter of We Are Marshall, makes his directorial debut with the high school reunion drama 10 Years. It was released theatrically at a few dozen locations this past fall, where it made little impact. It’s an ambling ensemble piece in which a bunch of classmates meet up for their 10 year high school reunion. The big draw here is the presence of Channing Tatum, hot off his summer smash Magic Mike. Those hoping he’ll take his shirt off are bound to be disappointed. In fact, everyone remains fully clothed for this chaste PG-13 soaper.\nSomewhere in this tangled web of characters is a potentially interesting character study. The problem is, Linden piled on the drama and didn’t know where to stop. Ultimately he’s interested in what changes can come about in the decade following high school. Some people achieve success, other don’t. But everyone has his or her own problems. Jake (Tatum), a sullen mortgage broker, appears to be happy with his girlfriend Jess (Jenna Dewan, the real-life Mrs. Tatum) but he’s burdened by some unresolved feelings for former flame Mary (Rosario Dawson). Cully (Parks and Recreation’s Chris Pratt) is intent on apologizing to every nerd he bullied in school. He overdoes it, much to the embarrassment of his wife Sam (Ari Graynor).\nMeanwhile, former party girl Anna (Lynn Collins) seems to be hiding something. We find out exactly what when Marty (Justin Long) and AJ (Max Minghella), two dudes who can’t stop bragging about their supposed successes, TP her house after the reunion. Reeves (Oscar Isaac) hit the big time as a singer-songwriter but never got over his crush on Elise (Kate Mara). There’s also Garrity (Brian Geraghty) and his wife Olivia (another Parks and Rec alum, Aubrey Plaza), who didn’t know her husband when he was known as G-Money in high school. No one at the reunion can believe Garrity married a white girl, he was so immersed in African-American culture a decade before.\nThat’s doesn’t cover everyone, but you get the idea. There’s too much going on for Linden to focus on anyone long enough for us to care. The cast is mostly likable, gamely trying to deepen their thinly written characters. Lynn Collins makes the deepest impression, making one wish the whole movie had focused on Anna. Everyone underplays, probably due as much to the underdeveloped character arcs as any direction they received from Linden. On one hand, it’s admirable that 10 Years wants to rise above some of the typical high school reunion clichés. This isn’t a silly romp like American Reunion. 10 Years is far more mature and subtle. But between those two, I know which one I’ll be quicker to revisit (hint: the dumb one with lots of T&A, I’ll take cheap laughs over unfulfilled potential any day).", "id": "<urn:uuid:82ff0912-4f32-4a8f-b3ab-d54818133de0>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogcritics.org/video/article/blu-ray-review-10-years1/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:05:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9739188551902771, "token_count": 658, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Yesterday’s House passage of cap-and-trade legislation designed to confront climate change is a landmark achievement, the first tangible step taken by the country that emits more greenhouse gas per capita than anyone in the world.\nThe bill itself still faces a tough test in the Senate. Passage is far from assured, and without similar actions by other major emitting countries, it won’t mean much. But it does finally demonstrate to the rest of the world that the United States is prepared to do its part, which puts the pressure on them to follow suit.\nThe bill itself, the product of a thousand political compromises, also isn’t perfect. But it also isn’t what its hysterical opponents claim it is. As Bryan Walsh acknowledges in Time:\n… critics have vastly overstated the likely cost. In fact, they’re all but lying. During the House debate, Republican whip Eric Cantor, using numbers from an American Petroleum Institute study, said that the bill would eventually cost more than $3,000 per family per year — but those numbers assume that billions of tons worth of inexpensive carbon offsets won’t be available under the bill, which would significantly inflate the overall cost. That’s not going to happen. A more reliable study from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast that the bill would cost the average U.S. household $175 in higher energy costs annually by 2020 — and other studies estimate that the energy-efficiency provisions in the bill might even save Americans money over time.\nWhen opponents are forced to lie so blatantly — in this case exaggerating the likely cost 17 times over — they don’t have much of an honest argument.", "id": "<urn:uuid:dbaccb35-1074-476c-9b46-8f3c424bfecd>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2009/06/27/passage-of-climate-change-bill-a-landmark-achievement/?cp=all", "date": "2013-05-18T08:04:42Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.950843095779419, "token_count": 343, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Georgia state legislators seem likely to pass a bill that would outlaw almost all abortions once a pregnancy has advanced beyond 20 weeks. (The current legal limit is 26 weeks). The rationale behind the bill is scientifically fraudulent, and its potential impact is tragic.\nLet’s deal first and quickly with the ungrounded premise behind House Bill 954, which claims that “by 20 weeks after fertilization there is substantial evidence that an unborn child has the physical structures necessary to experience pain.”\nNo, there isn’t.\nAlthough a relative handful of scientists claim otherwise — and many of those scientists are pro-life activists — the overwhelming scientific consensus is that the neural connections needed to feel pain do not exist in a fetus until at least 24 weeks into gestation and even beyond that. A 2010 review of all research in that area by Britain’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists makes the science behind the question quite clear.\nNow, let’s talk about the practical impact of such a bill.\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, nine out of 10 abortions performed in the United States occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most of those are unplanned, unwanted pregnancies that the mother chooses to terminate.\nHowever, the small fraction of abortions that occur after the proposed 20-week deadline are a very different matter. Many if not most such abortions occur not because the pregnancy is unwanted, but because prenatal testing has discovered serious or even fatal abnormalities in the development of the fetus.\nHowever, rather than create an exemption for such tragic cases, HB 954 cruelly and callously forbids it. In fact, they are the target of the bill. Abortions beyond the 20-week limit would be allowed only to save the life of the mother or “to avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function,” which is a very high standard for a “health of the mother” exception. There is no provision regarding severe impairment of the fetus.\nGeorgia is not alone in considering such legislation. To the contrary, HB 954 is part of a nationwide crusade to pass such laws. In the handful of states where it has passed, it’s already having an impact.\nFor example, in Nebraska last year, Danielle Deaver suffered a serious setback 22 weeks into a planned pregnancy when her water broke prematurely. Her doctors told her that her fetus’ lung and limb development had ceased as a result, and that even if carried to term, the baby would be born unable to breathe. But under a newly passed state law almost identical to that under consideration here in Georgia, Deaver was denied the right to end that pregnancy.\nWhen she finally went into premature labor, the child died 15 minutes after birth. This was considered humane, moral and proper by Nebraska legislators.\nIn Washington, D.C., congressional Republicans are trying to pass a bill imposing similar restrictions on residents of the District of Columbia. At a press conference this week, Christy Zink, a D.C. resident and mother of two, recalled the impact that such a law would have had on her own tragic case.\nTwenty-two weeks into her pregnancy, tests determined that if carried to term, Zink’s fetus would be born with half of its brain missing and other structures compromised as well. Shocked by the news, she and her husband made the difficult choice to end the pregnancy. Under the so-called “Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,” however, she would have been denied the right to do so.\n“Its very premise — that it prevents pain — is a lie,” Zink said of the bill. “If this bill had been passed before my pregnancy, I would have had to carry to term and give birth to a baby whom the doctors concurred had no chance of a life and would have experienced near-constant pain.”\nHere’s Zink’s statement. Watch it, and as you do, remember that in the eyes of many this mother of two is a murderer because of the difficult decision that she and her husband were forced to make, a deeply personal decision that members of Congress and Georgia legislators want to strip from citizens of this country because as elected representatives, they believe themselves to be more qualified.\nThese decisions are not easy. Several years ago, Rick Santorum and his wife Karen faced a similar dilemma and took a very different course, as he often describes in very moving terms. They decided to see their pregnancy through to term, even knowing that the child would certainly die once it left the womb. Just as their doctors warned them, their son, Gabriel, died two hours after his birth.\nNo one should question the decision that the Santorums made. It was their personal struggle, and they handled it on the basis of their own values, thoughts and faith. It is the essence of freedom to be able to make such decisions yourself, free of government dictate.\nLikewise, however, I also do not believe it within the purview of the Santorums or Georgia legislators or members of Congress to question or most of all overrule the decisions that other Americans might make in that same situation. It is, or ought to be, unthinkable.\n– Jay Bookman", "id": "<urn:uuid:864bc24a-65c5-4118-bbda-610d489bf669>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2012/02/22/georgia-anti-abortion-bill-strikes-personal-liberty/?cp=9", "date": "2013-05-18T05:26:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9756085872650146, "token_count": 1093, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "For all the talk of how America is following in the footsteps of debt-riddled Greece, here is one way our politics is charting a very different course: We are not waiting to reach the very edge of the abyss before moving our parties away from the center.\nOne of the big stories from today’s primaries, which for the most part have been rendered less than front-page news outside the states holding them any given day, will be whether longtime Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar survives a challenge from tea-party favorite and State Treasurer Richard Mourdock. A recent poll (there haven’t been many of them) suggests Lugar’s time is up.\nThe headlines will be about the tea party throwing out a respected member of the D.C. establishment in a fit of ideologically pure pique. Yet, increasingly this kind of result is dog-bites-man news — for both parties.\nLast month, Pennsylvania Democrats threw out a pair of “Blue Dog Democrats” from the U.S. House. The Blue Dogs, who tried to push laws such as Obamacare in a more moderate direction when Democrats held all the levers of power in 2009-10, have gone from a peak of 54 members in those years to a projected 23 when the 113th Congress convenes next year. Most of those losses have come at the hands of Republican challengers in general elections, or via retirements. But as the New York Times reported about the Pennsylvania races:\nThe ouster of the Democratic incumbents — and the tough primaries being waged against some House Republicans — suggest that redistricting ultimately is going to send more liberal Democrats and more conservative Republicans to the House.\nThat may be true in U.S. House races, where voters can be moved around during redistricting, but we’ve also seen changes in Senate races that cover entire states.\nLugar would be one example, with the list of ousted Republicans also including Bob Bennett of Utah in 2010 and, perhaps, Utah’s Orrin Hatch this year. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska lost her primary in 2010, only to win re-election as a third-party candidate write-in Republican [note: the foregoing text has been corrected -- KW] in the general election. So did Connecticut’s Joe Lieberman in 2006, whom Democrats punished for his support of the Iraq war just six years after appearing on the party’s national ticket as its vice-presidential nominee. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas had to go to a runoff to remain the Democratic nominee for Senate in 2010, eventually losing her seat to a Republican that November.\nOn the other hand, GOP voters chose as their nominee the man who, with the exception of Jon Huntsman, was considered the most moderate person in the field — even if the Obama campaign will now spend months trying to convince you Mitt Romney is a dangerous extremist. So the move away from moderation has its limits.\nWhen primary voters in both major parties punish moderate incumbents, the idea seems to be that they want to elect more people truly committed to the cause. But can the cause ever be advanced if the other side is equally committed to electing people determined to block it? Can either party, moving away from the center, elect enough of its own members to push through an agenda that will be uniformly opposed by the other party? The huge Democratic gains of 2006 and 2008 were not typical of our electoral history — and their overreach afterward was sharply rebuked by the voters in 2010. Can the Republicans make a similar follow-up gain this year as they are also moving away from the center? Does the pendulum really swing that fast? And why wouldn’t it just keep reversing course rather than staying in your preferred direction for very long?\nHow this trend plays out in the long run is anyone’s guess. My guess is that, sooner than later, the electorate will tire of the pendulum moving so far, so fast. But there are two recent examples from Europe that suggest the mushy middle doesn’t necessarily work, either.\nThe most recent one is, as advertised above, from Greece. Sunday’s elections there were a smackdown of the country’s leading center-left and center-right parties, both of which backed the bailout-and-austerity package from Greece’s European neighbors. Together, the two main parties won just 32 percent of the vote — down from 77 percent in the last elections a few years ago. The largest party won less than 19 percent (although it will have a larger share of the seats in parliament).\nMore pertinent, however, is the nature of the parties that ate into their vote totals. The second-place party is called — this is the translation of the party’s name in Greek, not my editorial comment on its policies — the Coalition of the Radical Left. The Communist Party won 9 percent to finish fifth, and a neo-Nazi party (known as the “Golden Dawn” party) won 7 percent to wind up sixth. Together, the Communists and the neo-Nazis will have almost one-sixth of the seats in the Greek parliament. Two brand-new parties took another one-sixth of the vote.\nThink about that: A collection of Communists, neo-Nazis and two parties that had never competed before managed to equal the votes of the country’s two longest-standing parties. If that’s not a rebuke of the establishment, I don’t know what is.\nAnother anti-centric example is Northern Ireland. For years, centrist parties representing the two opposing viewpoints there — remaining in the United Kingdom, or separating to join the Republic of Ireland — tried to make deals. It wasn’t until the two extremes on each side took a stab at working together that power-sharing under the Good Friday accord actually worked.\nOf course, we are not in the dire straits of either Greece, which has already had one technical default on its debt, or Northern Ireland, which suffered decades of self-inflicted terrorism. Nor have we seen if either of those examples yields good results in the long run. (One of history’s greatest — and most humble! — foreign correspondents reported from Northern Ireland just before power-sharing began there, questioning whether two extremes could truly co-exist for very long.)\nThe jury is still out here, too.\n– By Kyle Wingfield", "id": "<urn:uuid:88ca50a6-7933-41d6-aa9d-ef2bc9356d16>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.ajc.com/kyle-wingfield/2012/05/08/2012-tuesday-should-we-worry-about-the-primary-losses-of-moderates/?cp=all", "date": "2013-05-18T08:04:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9639703631401062, "token_count": 1321, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "It isn’t the bitterest of Georgia’s football rivalries. Just the oldest and most competitive.\nGeorgia and Auburn first played in Atlanta’s Piedmont Park in 1892. They have played 113 times since then. Auburn has won 53. Georgia has won 52. They have tied eight.\nSo, if Georgia were to win this year’s meeting at Auburn on Saturday, the Deep South’s oldest college-football rivalry would pull completely even at 53-53-8.\nAfter all these games, all these years, only 56 points separate the teams. Georgia has scored 1,778 and Auburn 1,722. The average score in their meetings is 15.7-15.2.\n“I think that as we go on during the week the younger guys will get a better picture of what this rivalry is and has been over the years and what it’s meant,” Auburn coach Gene Chizik said Sunday. “It’s just a great rivalry.

As Chizik mentioned Sunday, no current Auburn player has experienced a win over Georgia.\nOver the years, it has been a curious series in that the road team has won more often than the home team. Georgia has an all-time record of 14-9-2 in games played at Auburn, while the Tigers have an 18-11 record in Athens. The series was mostly played at neutral sites from 1892 through 1958.\nAnother quirk in the Georgia-Auburn series in recent years is that the lower-ranked team has found disproportionate success. Neither team was ranked entering last year’s game, but the lower-ranked or unranked team has won seven of the past 13 meetings when one or both teams were ranked. As you know, Auburn will go into Saturday’s game ranked No. 2 in the nation and Georgia unranked.

{"text": "Just as there are many variants and forms of electronic malware and Internet-based threats around the globe, so there are many forms of protection against these threats. Signature-based detection is one of the multifarious forms of defense that have been developed in order to keep us safe from malicious content.\nAlthough signature-based detection can be argued to have been overshadowed by more sophisticated methods of protection in some environments, it remains as a core ‘technique’ featuring in the anti-virus controls of packages and suites that work to protect a user’s system today.\nHow does signature-based detection work?\nSignature-based detection works by scanning the contents of computer files and cross-referencing their contents with the “code signatures” belonging to known viruses. A library of known code signatures is updated and refreshed constantly by the anti-virus software vendor.\nIf a viral signature is detected, the software acts to protect the user’s system from damage. Suspected files are typically quarantined and/or encrypted in order to render them inoperable and useless.\nClearly there will always be new and emerging viruses with their own unique code signatures. So once again, the anti-virus software vendor works constantly to assess and assimilate new signature-based detection data as it becomes available, often in real time so that updates can be pushed out to users immediately and zero-day vulnerabilities can be avoided.\nNext-generation signature-based detection\nNew variants of computer virus are of course developed every day and security companies now work to also protect users from malware that attempts to disguise itself from traditional signature-based detection. Virus authors have tried to avoid their malicious code being detected by writing “oligomorphic“, “polymorphic” and more recently “metamorphic” viruses with signatures that are either disguised or changed from those that might be held in a signature directory.\nDespite these developments, the Internet at large does of course still function on a daily basis.

{"text": "Many technologies and tools in use in universities and colleges are not developed for educational settings. In the classroom particularly teachers have become skilled at applying new technologies such as Twitter to educational tasks. But technology also plays a crucial role behind the scenes in any educational organisation in supporting and managing learning, and like classroom tools these technologies are not always developed with education in mind. So it is refreshing to find an example of an application developed for UK Higher and Further education being adopted by the commercial sector.\nArchi is an open source ArchiMate modelling tool developed as part of JISC’s Flexible Service Delivery programme to help educational institutions take their first steps in enterprise architecture modelling. ArchiMate is a modelling language hosted by the Open Group who describe it as “a common language for describing the construction and operation of business processes, organizational structures, information flows, IT systems, and technical infrastructure”. Archi enforces all the rules of ArchiMate so that the only relationships that can be established are those allowed by the language.\nSince the release of version 1.0 in June 2010 Archi has built up a large user base and now gets in excess of 1000 downloads per month. Of course universities and colleges are not the only organisations that need a better understanding of their internal business processes, we spoke to Phil Beauvoir, Archi developer at JISC CETIS, about the tool and why it has a growing number of users in the commercial world.\nChristina Smart (CS): Can you start by giving us a bit of background about Archi and why was it developed?\nPhil Beauvoir (PB): In summer of 2009 Adam Cooper asked whether I was interested in developing an ArchiMate modelling tool. Some of the original JISC Flexible Service Delivery projects had started to look at their institutional enterprise architectures, and wanted to start modelling. Some projects had invested in proprietary tools, such as BiZZdesign’s Architect, and it was felt that it would be a good idea to provide an open source alternative. Alex Hawker (the FSD Programme manager) decided to invest six months of funding to develop a proof of concept tool to model using the ArchiMate language. The tool would be aimed at the beginner, be open source, cross-platform and would have limited functionality. I started development on Archi in earnest in January 2010 and by April had the first alpha version 0.7 ready. Version 1.0 was released in June 2010, it grew from there.\nCS: How would you describe Archi?\nPB: The web site describes Archi as: “A free, open source, cross platform, desktop application that allows you to create and draw models using the ArchiMate language”. Users who can’t afford proprietary software, would use standard drawing tools such as Omnigraffle or Visio for modelling. Archi is positioned somewhere between those drawing tools and a tool like BiZZdesign’s Architect. It doesn’t have all the functionality and enterprise features of the BiZZdesign tool, but it has more than just plain drawing tools. Archi also has hints and helps and user assistance technology built into it, so when you’re drawing elements there are certain ArchiMate rules about which connections you can make, if you try to make a connection that’s not allowed you get an explanation why not. So for the beginner it is a great way to start understanding ArchiMate. We keep the explanations simple because we aim to make things easier for those users who beginners in ArchiMate. As the main developer I try to keep Archi simple, because there’s always a danger that you can keep adding on features and that would make it unusable. I try to steer a course between usability and features.\nAnother aspect of Archi is the way it supports the modelling conversation. Modelling is not done in isolation; it’s about capturing a conversation between key stakeholders in an organisation. Archi allows you to sketch a model and take notes in a Sketch View before you add the ArchiMate enterprise modelling rules. A lot of people use the Sketch View. It enables a capture of a conversation, the “soft modelling” stage before undertaking “hard modelling”.\nCS: How many people are using it within the Flexible Service Delivery programme?\nPB: I’m not sure, I know the King’s College, Staffordshire and Liverpool John Moores projects were using it. Some of the FSD projects tended to use both Architect and Archi. If they already had one licence for BiZZdesign Architect they would carry on using it for their main architect, whereas other “satellite” users in the institution would use Archi.\nCS: Archi has a growing number of users outside education, who are they and how did they discover Archi?\nPB: Well the first version was released in June 2010, and people in the FSD programme were using it. Then in July 2010 I got an email from a large Fortune 500 insurance company in the US, saying they really liked the tool and would consider sponsoring Archi if we implemented a new feature. I implemented the feature anyway and we’ve built up the relationship with them since then. I know that this company has in the region of 100 enterprise architects and they’ve rolled Archi out as their standard enterprise architecture modelling tool.\nI am also aware of other commercial companies using it, but how did they discover it? Well I think it’s been viral. A lot of businesses spend a lot of money advertising and pushing products, but the alternate strategy is pull, when customers come to you. Archi is of the pull variety, because there is a need out there, we haven’t had to do very much marketing, people seem to have found Archi on their own. Also the TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) developed by the Open Group is becoming very popular and I guess Archi is useful for people adopting TOGAF.\nIn 2010 BiZZdesign were I think concerned about Archi being a competitor in the modelling tool space. However now they’re even considering offering training days on Archi, because Archi has become the de facto free enterprise modelling tool. Archi will never be a competitor to BiZZdesign’s Architect, they have lots of developers and there’s only me working on Archi, it would be nuts to try to compete. So we will focus on the aspects of Archi that make it unique, the learning aspects, the focus on beginners and the ease of use, and clearly forge out a path between the two sets of tools.\nMany people will start with Archi and then upgrade to BiZZdesign’s Architect, so we’re working on that upgrade path now.\nCS: Why do you think it is so popular with business users?\nPB: I’m end-user driven, for me Archi is about the experience of the end users, ensuring that the experience is first class and that it “just works”. It’s popular with business users firstly because it’s free, secondly because it works on all platforms, thirdly because it’s aimed at those making their first steps with ArchiMate.\nCS: What is the immediate future for Archi?\nPB: We’re seeking sponsorship deals and other models of sustainability because obviously JISC can’t go on supporting it forever. One of the models of sustainability is to get Archi adopted by something like the Eclipse Foundation. But you have to be careful that development continues in those foundations, because there is a risk of it becoming a software graveyard, if you don’t have the committers who are prepared to give their time. There is a vendor who has expressed an interest in collaborating with us to make sure that Archi has a future.\nLots of software companies now have service business models, so you provide the tool for free but charge for providing services on top of the free tool. The Archi tool will always be free, anyone could package it up and sell it. I know they’re doing that in China because I’ve had emails from people doing it, they’ve translated it and are selling it and that’s ok because that’s what the licence model allows.\nIn terms of development we’re adding on some new functionality. A new concept of a Business Model Canvas is becoming popular, where you sketch out your new business models. The canvas is essentially a nine box grid which you add various key partners, stakeholders etc to. We’re adding a canvas construction kit to Archi, so people can design their own canvas for new business models. The canvas construction kit is aimed at the high level discussions that people have when they start modelling their organisations.\nCS: You’ve developed a number of successful applications for the education sector over the years, including, Colloquia, Reload and ReCourse, how do you feel the long term future for Archi compares with those?\nPB: Colloquia was the first tool I developed back in 1998, and I don’t really think it’s used anymore. But really Colloquia was more a proof of concept to demonstrate that you could create a learning environment around the conversational model, which supported learning in a different way from the VLEs that were emerging at the time. Its longevity has been as a forerunner to social networking and to the concept of the Personal Learning Environment.\nReload was a set of tools for doing content packaging and SCORM. They’re not meant for teachers, but they’re still being used.\nThe ReCourse Learning Design tool developed for a very niche audience of those people developing scripted learning designs.\nI think the long term future for Archi is better than those, partly because there’s a very large active community using it, and partly because it can be used by all enterprises and isn’t just a specific tool for the education sector. I think Archi has an exciting future.\nPhil has received some very positive feedback about Archi via email from JISC projects as well as those working in the commercial world.\n\"The feeling I get from Archi is that it's helping me to create shapes, link and position them rather than jumping around dictating how I can work with it. And the models look much nicer too... I think Archi will allow people to investigate EA modelling cost free to see whether it works for them, something that's not possible at the moment.”\n“So why is Archi significant? It is an open source tool funded by JISC based on the ArchiMate language that achieves enough of the potential of a tool like BiZZdesign Architect to make it a good choice for relatively small enterprises, like the University of Bolton to develop their modelling capacity without a significant software outlay.”  Stephen Powell from the Co-educate project (JISC Curriculum Design Programme).\n“I'm new to EA world, but Archi 1.1 makes me fill like at home! So easy to use and so exciting...”\n“Version 1.3 looks great! We are rolling Archi out to all our architects next week. The ones who have tried it so far all love it.”\nFind Out More\nIf this interview has whetted your appetite, more information about Archi, and the newly released version 2.0 is available at http://archi.cetis.ac.uk.

{"text": "I just finished reading the much-hyped book, Behind the Beautiful Forevers, which well deserves the hype. It is an extraordinary look at life in Annawadi, a slum adjacent to Mumbai’s modern international airport. Author Katherine Boo spent three years in the slum (researching, interviewing, videotaping, recording) trying to understand “how ordinary low-income people—particularly women and children—were negotiating the age of global markets.” The question that drives her is: “What is the infrastructure of opportunity in this society?” It is a critical question for any society, and one that Boo has been exploring in various poor communities for the past twenty years as a staff writer for the New Yorker. The answer she paints for Annawadi makes me question my relatively bullish assessment of India’s growth prospects. The residents of Annawadi, many of whom earn a living by scavenging through garbage, are remarkably resilient, innovative, determined, and hard-working towards their goal of upward mobility. But they are also stymied at almost every turn by a corrupt system.\nThe plot turns on a woman who, in her desperation, sets herself on fire but frames her neighbors in an act of vengeance. The number of people who try to profit from this calamity is breathtaking. Also breathtaking is how many well-intentioned programs to help the poor do nothing of the sort. Corrupt power brokers appropriate the municipal water and charge their neighbors to use it; a renegade social worker from World Vision, the American Christian charity, collects money for a new water tap but runs away with it; the director of a local orphanage sells for cash the goodies donated for the children; a woman collects money for a school but never teaches.\nBehind the Beautiful Forevers is not intended as a commentary on global development, but it will inevitably be read as such. Microfinance comes across as particularly misguided: “The government was lending money at subsidized rates to help poor entrepreneurs start employment-generating businesses. These new companies could be fictions, though. A slum-dweller would request a loan for an imaginary business; a local government official would certify how many jobs it would bring to a needy community; and an executive of the state-owned Dena Bank would approve it. Then the official and the bank manager would take a hunk of the loan. Asha, having befriended the bank manager, was helping him select the Annawadians who would get the loans—for her own cut of the money.” The indictments of microfinance in the book will resonate with recent research that suggests that even well-managed programs are not the poverty-busters they have claimed to be. In his exhaustive Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance, David Roodman from the Center for Global Development ultimately concludes that there is no definitive causation between microfinance and poverty reduction.\nBy the end of Behind the Beautiful Forevers, I am left more convinced that simply giving cash directly to the poor is the most effective way to alleviate poverty. As Boo demonstrates in her lively descriptions, the poor in Annawadi are smart, and clearly know better than anyone else what they need. Directly giving cash to the poor is an increasingly accepted development strategy that recognizes that their main problem is not having enough money, that they know how to spend money effectively, and that more middlemen simply create more opportunities for corruption and inefficiency. Direct cash transfer programs such as Oportunidades in Mexico and Bolsa Familia in Brazil offer small monthly cash sums to poor families, often under the condition that they enroll their children in school and take the children to medical checkups.\nThe results of these programs are impressive, to say the least. One Brazilian economist credits Bolsa Familia with 17 percent of the country’s reduction in inequality since 2001. “Pensions and other welfare payments had a similar effect, but at a massively higher cost.” In Mexico, as a result of Oportunidades, enrollment in rural high schools is up 85 percent. Mexico’s success with Oportunidades has inspired forty other countries to implement similar programs. One new NGO that I’m watching closely, GiveDirectly, is using census data to locate the poorest households in Kenya (80% of which report not having enough food for tomorrow), and using Safaricom’s M-Pesa mobile payments system to directly transfer money to them. GiveDirectly doesn’t tell recipients what to do with the money, but recipients so far report using it to buy food, livestock, and clothes, invest in their homes, and pay school fees. Surely the people in Annawadi would quickly figure out how to better their lives with such cash transfers. As The Economist suggests, perhaps once India issues national ID numbers to more of its citizens—proper documentation often determines whether poor people can access services, and India is leading a landmark identification effort—the country could be well-placed to create a robust cash transfer program of its own. I suspect that only through such a program will the all-important “infrastructure of opportunity” in India improve.", "id": "<urn:uuid:b30dc0c9-f386-4a90-85ed-17dbcea62235>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.cfr.org/coleman/2012/03/15/behind-the-beautiful-forevers-and-the-fight-against-poverty/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:22:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9639634490013123, "token_count": 1075, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "By Jason Kohn, Contributing Columnist\nLike many of us, scientific researchers tend to be creatures of habit. This includes research teams working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. government agency charged with measuring the behavior of oceans, atmosphere, and weather.\nMany of these climate scientists work with massive amounts of data – for example, the National Weather Service collecting up-to-the-minute temperature, humidity, and barometric readings from thousands of sites across the United States to help forecast weather. Research teams then rely on some the largest, most powerful high-performance computing (HPC) systems in the world to run models, forecasts, and other research computations.\nGiven the reliance on HPC resources, NOAA climate researchers have traditionally worked onsite at major supercomputing facilities, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where access to supercomputers are just steps away. As researchers crate ever more sophisticated models of ocean and atmospheric behavior, however, the HPC requirements have become truly staggering.\nNow, NOAA is using a super-high-speed network called “n-wave” to connect research sites across the United States with the computing resources they need. The network has been operating for several years, and today transports enough data to fill a 10-Gbps network to full capacity, all day, every day. NOAA is now upgrading this network to allow even more data traffic, with the goal of ultimately supporting 100-Gbps data rates.\n“Our scientists were really used to having a computer in their basement,” says Jerry Janssen, manager, n-wave Network, NOAA, in a video about the project. “When that computer moved a couple thousand miles away, we had to give them a lot of assurances that, one, the data would actually move at the speed they needed it to move, but also that they could rely on it to be there. The amount of data that will be generated under this model will exceed 80-100 Terabits per day.”\nThe n-wave project means much more than just a massive new data pipe. It represents a fundamental shift in the way that scientists can conduct their research, allowing them to perform hugely demanding supercomputer runs of their data from dozens of remote locations. As a result, it gives NOAA climate scientists much more flexibility in where and how they work.\n“For the first time, NOAA scientists and engineers in completely separate parts of the country, all the way to places like Alaska and Hawaii and Puerto Rico, will have the bandwidth they need, without restriction,” says Janssen. “NOAA will now be able to do things it never thought it could do before.”\nIn addition to providing fast, stable access to HPC resources, n-wave is also allowing NOAA climate scientists to share resources much more easily with scientists in the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies. Ideally, this level of collaboration and access to supercomputing resources will help climate scientists continue to develop more effective climate models, improve weather forecasts, and allow us to better understand our climate.\nPowering Vital Climate Research\nThe high-speed nationwide HPC connectivity capability provided by n-wave is now enabling a broad range of NOAA basic science and research activities. Examples include:\n- Basic data dissemination, allowing research teams to collect up-to-the-minute data on ocean, atmosphere, and weather from across the country, and make that data available to other research teams and agencies nationwide.\n- Ensemble forecasting, where researchers run multiple HPC simulations using different initial conditions and modeling techniques, in order to refine their atmospheric forecasts and minimize errors.\n- Severe weather modeling, where scientists draw on HPC simulations, real-time atmospheric data, and archived storm data to better understand and predict the behavior of storms.\n- Advancing understanding of the environment to be able to better predict short-term and long-term environmental changes, mitigate threats, and provide the most accurate data to inform policy decisions.\nAll of this work is important, and will help advance our understanding of Earth’s climate. And it is all a testament to the amazing networking technologies and infrastructure that scientists now have at their disposal, which puts the most powerful supercomputing resources in the world at their fingertips – even when they are thousands of miles away.", "id": "<urn:uuid:c23e3842-a002-4f6b-9554-bafecec0beed>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.cisco.com/cle/noaa-how-networks-are-used-in-climate-research/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:10:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9429180026054382, "token_count": 899, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Barbie, the iconic porcelain skinned, perfectly coiffed doll, is undergoing a Panem makeover. The unattainable hourglass figure will be donning the famous Mockingjay pin as the doll is re-imagined for battle in the Hunger Games arena.\nNo longer a perky blonde, Mattel’s Katniss doll includes Jennifer Lawrence’s hooded jacket and military style pants as well as her trusty bow and quiver –perfect for slaying diminutive Tributes.\nAlthough I’m excited to see a 12-inch version of Katniss, I was a little surprised by Mattel’s partnership with the series. It’s hard to envision young girls who haven’t read Suzanne Collin’s books re-enacting the graphic battle scenes. Let’s face it, the Hunger Games arena is a far cry from the Pepto-Bismol pink of the Dream House. Given the mass popularity of the books and film, however, it’s a sound financial investment for the company and they have reiterated that the doll is intended for adult collectors. Rabid fans like myself will likely snatch up the doll quicker than supplies at the Cornucopia.\nThe doll led me to think of some other female characters that are unlikely to join Mattel’s lineup:\n* Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace in “Pulp Fiction” complete with Jack Rabbit Slim $5 shake, adrenaline shot and bloodied nose.\n* Hit Girl from “Kick-Ass” — a deadly pre-pubescent assassin complete with butterfly knife, guns and a smattering of potty-mouthed phrases.\n* Lizbeth Salander — main character in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo– complete with Taser gun, bondage equipment and tattoo needle.\n* Daryl Hannah’s character, Elle Driver, in “Kill Bill” would come with syringe, nurse’s uniform and with or without both eyes.\nThe Katniss doll made her debut April 9 and is already backordered until August, so evidently the retail sale odds will be ever in Mattel’s favor.\nReserve yours here! http://www.barbiecollector.com/shop/doll/hunger-games-katniss-doll-w3320", "id": "<urn:uuid:58b1c499-afc1-4662-bcb4-d46b56b34a14>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.dailymail.com/nerdliving/2012/04/11/warrior-princess-barbie-with-kung-fu-grip/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:29:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8992915749549866, "token_count": 499, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "On December 5, 1971, five men entered the Quality Motel on Main Street and forced their way into the room of Davenport Police Patrolman Leon Washington. The men hit Officer Washington and tied him up, then stole three automatic pistols, a revolver, and a shotgun. It is possible that the men also tried to rob the motel offices—in any case, an alarm went off, alerting the police.\nPatrolman Sam L. Raley and his partner Patrolman Michael Farnsworth, who had joined the department in August, were among the first officers to arrive on the scene. They observed four men fleeing from the motel and tried to stop them. The suspects started shooting and the police returned fire.\nPatrolman Raley was lucky—three bullets just missed him. Patrolman Farnsworth wasn’t. The twenty-nine year old man died of a gunshot wound to the head shortly after being rushed to t. Luke’s Hospital.\nThe police, joined by Scott County deputies and five squads from the Iowa Highway Patrol, cordoned off a two block area and searched the motel and surrounding buildings. Four suspects were arrested and charged with first degree murder.\nA continuous honor guard of uniformed police officers stood at either end of the casket as more than 400 people visited Runge Mortuary to pay their respects to Michael Farnsworth, the first Davenport Police Officer to be killed in the line of duty since 1958.*\nDonations for the Farnsworth family were sent to the Police station by people all over the Quad-Cities—over $800 was collected in two days. A clothing store offered to give Mrs. Farnsworth a dress for the funeral. The city paid the funeral expenses, and Davenport Memorial Park donated two burial plots to the family—a gift that was usually given only to war veterans killed in action.\nThe funeral, held at the First Presbyterian Church, was attended by almost 200 police officers, active and retired, from as far away as Dubuque, Iowa, and Galesburg, Illinois. All members of the Davenport Police Department and Fire Department, barring those on shift duty, were present, including Patrolman Leon Washington.\n“His death in responding to the Call of duty deeply touches us all,” said Reverend Dr. Donald Blackstone. “[We must] increase out respect for, and appreciated of, and cooperation with out law enforcement officers and agencies. . . if we will seriously undertake and implement these changes, the death of Michael Farnsworth will not be in vain.”**\nAfter the service, a double line of police officers formed and an honor guard of six officers in full dress uniform escorted the coffin as the pallbearers carried it to the hearse. One of these pallbearers was Sam Raley.\nOfficers stood at attention long the route to the cemetery, which led past the Police Station, its doors draped in black. Flags all over the city were flown at half mast. Once the procession reached the cemetery, officers lined the path from the hearse to the gravesite.\nDavenport police officers are not often lost to us in the line of duty, though they willingly put themselves at risk for us every day.

{"text": "Last semester, when I was elected as the co-president of UR Hip Hop with Shaelom James (a student ran Hip Hop organization in the University of Rochester), I immediately reached out to UR Christian Fellowship and Church of Love Associate Pastor Brian White about hosting a gospel rap concert. White always spoke about the rappers and managers that he was connected to in the industry and how eager they were to perform. When I approached him, it was no different – the only thing that needed to be dealt with was the logistics.\nBut little did I know that that was going to be the greatest obstacle to overcome for our highly anticipated concert. By the time October came along, we were gung-ho on having our concert in the May Room on Nov. 13. The May Room is located in the same facility as one of our major dining halls, conference room locations, practice and study rooms and Starbucks – it was the perfect time and place to attract passer-bys to the show.\nUnfortunately, despite the fact that the Church of Love had access to all of the necessary equipment for the concert, UR’s Event Support required us to use their services at an estimated $750 for the night. Obviously, as a student ran organization that hasn’t been funded for the past 2 years and only had 2 to 3 weeks left to the event, we had no choice but to post-pone our show to a December date and try to work out negotiations with Event Support in the mean time.\nAgain, we underestimated how difficult it was to use any other services than the one that the University has granted monopolistic control. The tedious process required us to have the Church of Love provide their umbrella insurance (which wasn’t a problem), two recommendations from event coordinators who have used their services in the past (a point which wasn’t bought up until 2 weeks into negotiations), and a completely adjusted insurance policy that would require the Church of Love to cover UR under every section of their insurance company agreement. And yes, all this was for one show. To make matters worse, the manager of Event Support, a full-time non-student employee of the University, was usually tardy with his emails.\nBut in the end, we were finally able to find a financially and totalitarian free alternative: the Interfaith Chapel. This Saturday, Dec. 11, in UR’s Interfaith Chapel from 8 to 10 p.m., UR Hip Hop will be hosting “Saving Hip Hop.” The FREE event will include performances by Jeff Lot, INF, El Pastor, and even some of our MCs. Students and community members are invited to come to a powerful night of rap that sends a message.\nI can confidentially assure anyone who is unfamiliar with the genre that they will be more than pleasantly surprised. I was completely alien to how much it’s evolved with hip hop and how talented Christian MCs are. Their skill, flow, bars, beats and storytelling structure transcends any reservations that people may have about proselytizing. At the end of the day, they are just rappers who are sharing their story in a unique way; if it inspires you to see or feel about life differently, amen; if it impresses you from an artistic standpoint, amen.\nI’m just grateful that the show is finally happening after all of the setbacks we faced. I’ve learned so much in the process of planning this show.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7ca47441-2033-434d-ad53-1ae3b690de20>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.democratandchronicle.com/youngprofessionals/?p=2118", "date": "2013-05-18T06:50:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9809173941612244, "token_count": 705, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The bacterium Micavibrio aeruginosavorus (yellow), leeching\non a Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium (purple).\nWhat’s the news: If bacteria had blood, the predatory microbe Micavibrio aeruginosavorus would essentially be a vampire: it subsists by hunting down other bugs, attaching to them, and sucking their life out. For the first time, researchers have sequenced the genome of this strange microorganism, which was first identified decades ago in sewage water. The sequence will help better understand the unique bacterium, which has potential to be used as a “living antibiotic” due to its ability to attack drug-resistant biofilms and its apparent fondness for dining on pathogens.\nAnatomy of a Vampire:\n- The bacterium has an interesting multi-stage life history. During its migratory phase it sprouts a single flagellum and goes hunting for prey. Once it find a delectable morsel of bacterium, it attacks and irreversibly attaches to the surface, and sucks out all of the good stuff: carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, DNA, etc.\n- Sated, the cell divides in two via binary fission, and the now-depleted host is left for dead.\nHungry for Pathogens:\n- M. aeruginosavorus cannot be grown by itself; it must be cultured along with another bacteria to feed upon. A 2006 study found that it only grew upon three bacterial species, all of which can cause pneumonia-like disease in humans. A more recent study showed that it can prey upon a wider variety of microbes, most of them potentially pathogenic, like E. coli.\n- These studies also found that M. aeruginosavorus has a knack for disrupting biofilms, the dense collection of bacteria that cause harmful plaques on teeth and medical implants alike, and can be up to 1,000 more resistant to antibiotics than free-swimming bugs.\n- The bacteria can also swim through viscous fluids like mucous and kills Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacterium that can colonize lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and form a glue-like film.\n- These qualities have caught the eye of researchers who think it could be used as a living antibiotic to treat biofilms and various types of drug-resistant bacteria, which are a growing problem in medicine. Sequencing the organism’s genome is an important step in understanding its biochemistry and how it preys on other microbes.\nClues From the Vampire Code:\n- The new study found that each phase of life involves the use (or expression) of different sets of genes. The migratory/hunting phase involves many segments that code for flagellum formation and genes involved in quorum sensing. The attachment phase involves a wide variety of secreted chemicals and enzymes that facilitate the flow of materials from the host.\n- Micavibrio aeruginosavorus possesses no genes for amino acid transporters, a rather rare trait only seen in a few other bacterial species that depend heavily upon their host to help them shuttle these vital protein building-blocks. This absence helps explain the bacterium’s dependence on a narrow range of prey, from which it directly steals amino acids. Although it remains unclear exactly how the microbe attaches to and infiltrates other cells.\nThe Future Holds:\n- The range of microbes upon which Micavibrio aeruginosavorus can survive is expanding; after being kept in laboratory conditions for years it has apparently evolved a more diverse diet. If this expansion continues, that could be a real problem for its use as an antibiotic; it could begin to eat beneficial gut bacteria, for example.\n- Researchers claim it is harmless to friendly gut microbes, but it hasn’t been tested on all the varieties of bacteria present in humans.\n- Several important steps must be taken before testing in people, like learning more about what traits makes another bacteria tasty to Micavibrio aeruginosavorus.

{"text": "- November 15th, 2008\n- Derek Robertson\n- Comments: 7 Comments »Tags: Consolarium, Endless Ocean, games based learning, Wii\nEndless Ocean for the Nintendo Wii was one of those games that immediately caught my eye. A wonderful world in which the player can become immersed in a rich, vibrant and somewhat hypnotically therapeutic underwater world. I’ve written about how I thought it might be used to drive learning before but my initial ideas have been put into place and extended beyond recognition by some really creative teachers.\nLast week I went with Margaret Cassidy from Stirling Council to Cowie PS to see a teacher that was using Endless Ocean with her class:\nMrs Bullivant and her class of P.6 children treated me to an afternoon of sheer joy. I walked in to a class that had been turned into an underwater world that was awash with a tide of enthusiastic and industrious learnning.\n- Streamers of various shades of blue were hung from two lines that criss-crossed the class.From these lines also hung starfish, sharks and other underwater creatures that the children had made.\n- The Wii was hooked up to the whiteboard and the gameplay was integral to the learning.\n- The children were divided into ‘dive teams’ and their ‘dive leader’ had to manage certain aspects of how the children worked together.\n- Children were engaged with a teacher led leson that investigated buoyancy.\n- Children were searching the web to find out more about some of the creatures that they discovered in the game.\n- A spreadsheet activity detailing the range of creatures that they had discovered was in place.\n- A shipwreck (created by the janitor) was sitting in the class. This helped drive much of the creative writing work.\n- The children created treasure maps and were using these to look at grid references.\n- Mermaids were created in art and design and very lifelike they were too!\n- Reference books were in great demand when I was in the class and the initial stimulus of the game appeared to drive a real interest for what could be found in the complementary resource that was the book.\n- Children actively encouraged to measure exactly how long 7 metres is as a result of finding out that that was how long a Great White Shark was.\nThis was just a wonderful visit and an example of what learning in class can be. Yes we need creative teachers to lead this but isn’t that what we are meant to be. The work that was in evidence in this class was delightful to witness and further cemented my ideas of the possibilities of sandbox games such as Endless Ocean.\nCategories Stirling Council", "id": "<urn:uuid:ed02b25b-582c-477f-af77-6a012b479875>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.educationscotland.gov.uk/consolarium/2008/11/15/endless-ocean-and-endless-learning-in-stirling/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9867492318153381, "token_count": 553, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The Rocky road to Philly\n\"After a short train journey from Washington DC, we arrived in city number 3 of the east coast in North America, Philadelphia. As it proved pretty difficult to find a decent hostel in Philadelphia, we treated ourselves to a few nights in the Travellodge! Again, it was a luxury we had been missing!\nThe following morning we got up early for our complimentary breakfast, before heading into the city. The Travellodge was located close to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, so we went there first and ran up the steps leading up to museum, as they are the same steps featured in the Rocky films. We weren't the only ones racing up them! We then had our photo taken by his statue.\nAn hour and two very sweaty girls later, we walked into the city centre. The weather seemed even hotter than it was in Washington.\nWe went to the Liberty Bell Museum, as it is now recognised as an international icon of freedom. The museum allows visitors to learn more about its origin and history. It was interesting and certainly worth a visit.\nWe then moved on to Independence Hall and the Declaration House, where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.\nOur final stop for the day was Benjamin Franklin's house which was pretty cool. We had also planned to go to Betsy Ross' house, as she is the woman who apparently sewed the first ever American flag, but we were told it was all a lie so we didn't bother!\nWe had worked up quite an appetite by this time so we found a lovely Italian restaurant, where we shared a pizza and salad. Having already been in America for a good couple of months, we soon realised that sharing meals was definitely the way forward. The portions are huge and we often found ourselves only being able to eat half of what we had ordered! After dinner, we found a liquor store and bought a bottle of wine, before heading back for a quiet night in, in front of the TV.\nHaving finished all our sight-seeing yesterday, we had planned to spend the day sunbathing at a local park we had come across. Unfortunately, we woke up to rain and thunderstorms, and we found ourselves with very little to do. We wandered into the city, before walking for miles to the nearest cinema, only to find we had just missed the showing. We walked for miles again back into the city and luckily found this great Mexican bar advertising $5 margarita's..... We didn't have to think twice! It actually turned out that we got 4 glasses each for just $5 each, and even though we were both desperately trying to save as much money as possible for New York, we couldn't turn down this excellent offer! So a couple of hours and 8 Margarita's later, we left the bar feeling slightly tipsy!\nWe walked a few more miles to get a Philly Cheese steak from Pat's; a restaurant regarded as the best in America for Philly Cheese Steaks. The sandwiches also originated from Pat's so we expected them to be delicious, but unfortunately we were disappointed. It is more of a fast food takeaway place as opposed to a restaurant, and because they are always so busy I think maybe they rush them a little bit. The steak wasn't great at all. There are definitely much nicer steak houses in America.\nThe following day was our last day in Philadelphia, and the sun was out again so we went to Fairmount Park for a day of sunbathing, which is just behind the Museum of Art. Sarah had a hair appointment in the morning, so I went down to the park on my own. For some reason, this man who must've been about 55, thought it acceptable to come and sunbathe with me and invite me round to his apartment. I felt pretty disgusted so I put my ipod on ad ignored him hoping he would get the message. Unfortunately, he didn't for a while, and as Sarah wasn't due back for a few hours, it made for a pretty uncomfortable morning. He eventually left and I moved to a different part of the park as he said he might come back! Other than that, Sarah and I spent a lovely afternoon topping up our tans and resting our tired feet before spending our last two weeks in New York City!\nListed below are links to blogs that reference this entry: The Rocky road to Philly.\nTrackBack URL for this entry:", "id": "<urn:uuid:2fda5575-fd7b-408f-93ae-61d8d51b535c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.examiner.co.uk/phileas/2009/09/the-rocky-road-to-philly.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:25:41Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9867841601371765, "token_count": 902, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational;Technical/Boilerplate"]}
{"text": "April 23, 2012 in Cooking with Woolies\nTomatoes are tough little guys and can be grown practically all year round. But I think summer tomatoes are the best! Sun-blushed with a beautiful deep red hue and sun-ripened until so sweet and tender, you can bite into them just as they are with a little sprinkle of salt.\nNow that autumn is in full swing, tomatoes are still to be found and still as delicious as ever, just maybe a little firmer and not as sweet. (It’s not just us that have to withstand the cold air this time of year!)\nMy best way to entice the natural sugars and flavour out of them when they are at this stage is to halve them and arrange them snugly into a large, deep baking tray. Sprinkle over 2 cloves finely chopped garlic, 1 chopped fresh chilli, a good glug of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and finish them off with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nThe trick is to slow roast them at about 160C⁰ for 35 – 40 minutes if you have them time, if not 180C⁰ for 10 minutes less will do just fine. Don’t be afraid to leave them in for longer if you want a more concentrated flavour and if you want a almost cheat the oven-dried tomato effect.\nThe balsamic encourages and enhances the natural caramelisation of the tomatoes sugars, bringing out all of that fabulous flavour, as does the sea salt. You can’t ever really go wrong with garlic and chilli but feel free to leave it out if you like, but seasoning is a must.\nYour beautifully roasted tomatoes are now ready to be tossed into a bowls of fresh pasta, a warm autumn salad with roasted wedges of butternut, mozzarella, rocket and coriander or as the fantastic beginnings of a tomato sauce or soup.. Speaking of soup, remember to enter your own, home-made soup recipe in the Woolworths Soup Competition.

I just chop them into a saucepan with red peppers and loads of chilli, but roasting them with the peppers will give you a far superior relish.\n- 4 mixed peppers, chopped\n- 2 slicing tomatoes, chopped\n- 500 g Free-range beef, cut into strips\n- 2 T olive oil\n- 2 red chillies, chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic\n- 1 x 5 cm ginger, peeled and grated\n- To make the relish, place olive oil in a saucepan over a medium to low heat with freshly chopped red chillies, garlic and the ginger.\n- Fry for 1–2 minues, or until fragrant.\n- Chop the mixed peppers and place in the pan. Add the chopped, slicing tomatoes and soya sauce. Fry for 15–20 minutes, adding more soya sauce if necessary.\n- Pan-fry the beef strips in olive oil for 3– 4 minutes, or until golden but still juicy.\n- Serve on a bed of fresh leaves and sliced red onion, with the chunky tomato and pepper relish on the side.\n- Season to taste.\nFind more easy and delicious ways to use Woollies’ products at The Pantry or pop over to Woolworths TASTE where we have more ideas with sun-blushed tomatoes, including new additions to Woolies’ specialty range, including crisp, yellow tinged Rosalini tomatoes, super-sweet pear-shaped mini San Marzano tomatoes large, ruby-red truss tomatoes and the exotic selection – an exclusive range of colourful, sweet and juicy tomatoes that are ideal for snacking and a perfect ingredient for a tomato quiche or salad.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5408271f-bd92-4ea9-a70d-a240fcd5b340>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.food24.com/wooliespantry/2012/04/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:09:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9074782133102417, "token_count": 815, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

So I had to set aside my disappointment in him and tune in as I watched the world’s most famous bounty hunter apologize for dropping the N bomb in a taped phone conversation with his estranged son. The best part was catching Chapman on Hannity & Colmes as he realized he was “not black” and therefore doesn’t have the right to use the word.

{"text": "Following his work with the Cabinet Office’s Efficiency and Reform Group (ERG), Matt Wood finds that political scientists must ask themselves two questions: precisely how they hope to make impact, and which society groups they want their work to be relevant to.\nCarrying out the core roles of a civil servant (conducting quick and instrumental literature searches, preparing concise presentations for ministers, verifying facts and statistics for government publications), I gained an appreciation for what civil servants want from political research, and how political scientists might meet that demand. I also became acutely aware of some of the problems involved for academics striving for greater ‘relevance’, particularly for researchers at the start of their careers.\nI can’t claim that my experiences are anything but partial and anecdotal but I hope to focus on some opportunities for academics to develop policy-focused relevance, as well as cultivating an appreciation of some of the barriers to engagement, and how researchers may overcome them. This will hopefully deepen the ‘relevance’ debate highlighted at this year’s PSA Conference by Matthew Flinders and Peter Riddell.\nThe demand for ‘evidence-based’ policy making is growing. Working in the ERG on an evidence-based policymaking project, I found policymakers frustrated at the relative gap between the immense demand for social scientific evaluation and improvement of public policies, and the relative reluctance of scholars to become involved. The current government is particularly keen, given tight fiscal constraints, to evaluate whether policies like payment by results and personal budgets produce better outcomes and value for money. Hence, policymakers are increasingly keen to bring in social scientists to produce such data on the effect of policy initiatives on outcomes such as social mobility, equality and efficiency, which in turn will effect which programmes receive money or are cut.\nPolicymakers are concerned that the majority of social researchers are not nearly engaged enough. Given this willingness within government to close the gap between social scientific research and practice, and use social scientific data to determine public spending, this would seem like a golden moment for the majority of political scientists to step up to the plate and make a real difference in determining how public resources are allocated.\nCivil servants are keen to engage with political science on academic best practice. They are interested in informal advice regarding best practice in carrying out semi-structured elite interviews, conducting rigorous literature searches, and interpreting and evaluating methodologies and research findings. Particularly in the context of the current civil service reform agenda, I found that civil servants are keen to gain methodological skills that form the bread and butter of everyday social scientific research practice.\nJunior civil servants are particularly keen to properly evaluating findings and learn about the choices involved in the research process. If my experience is replicated beyond the Cabinet Office, sharing research skills may represent a relatively untapped opportunity for political scientists to assert the relevance of their discipline and justify their value for money.\nIt seems there are big opportunities for political scientists to enhance their influence on public policy and assert the relevance of their subject to policymakers. Yet, there are also severe barriers that exist to political scientists (particularly early stage researchers), preventing them from engaging further with the public policy sphere:\nIt is no secret that the timescales of policymaking and academic research are hugely out of sync. Policymakers want policies evaluated and recommendations published within weeks (if not days), whereas quality research takes months, if not years to complete, write up and disseminate. Due to this time lag, traditional academic centres have been losing out to think tanks like the Institute for Government and Reform who conduct intensive short-term research projects aimed at tying in with the demands of policymakers and the political cycle. Their findings and recommendations are summarised in easily digestible executive summaries, whereas most journal articles in political science require the majority of the article to be read. Moreover, think tank research is also freely disseminated, whilst publishers jealously guard access to the top political science journals.\nFlinders’ proposal at the recent PSA Conference of ‘triple-writing’ is helpful in terms of wider societal engagement, and I would add that the findings of political science research could be much better communicated within the journal format. Civil servants preparing for a ministerial meeting will never have the chance to sit down and digest an 8,000 word article – they want the key points condensed into a succinct brief. Management journals have considered this and offer précis articles – accessible summaries of longer research pieces. Is this a format that political science journals should consider expanding, to increase impact?\nQuantitative evidence seems to be king in government. When researching evidence of policy outcomes I was constantly asked to find statistical (or merely numerical) evidence of increased productivity, money saved and value gained. When researching evidence to include in a publication or presentation, it was overwhelmingly an imperative to skip over qualitative studies to find that statistic or number that could be quoted in a publication or media response. Where qualitative evidence was used, it was in the form of internally-sourced illustrative anecdotes or ‘case study’ news pieces.\nThe question for qualitatively-oriented researchers (such as myself and early career scholars without the resources, connections or time to conduct macro-scale quantitative studies), is how to increase ‘impact’ when the very nature of our research puts us at a disadvantage to those who can produce neat sets of statistically significant ‘causal’ relationships. Surely we would not wish to sacrifice a whole arm of empirically insightful political science on the altar of policy engagement? Perhaps the case has simply not been made for why qualitative research is ‘relevant’ to public policy?\nCritics or activists?\nThe above point leads into a deeper discussion of whether political scientists really want to be that closely engaged. Some agree that engagement is a good thing while others are sceptical of promoting a close relationship with government. Still others might say it is not the job of political scientists to propose solutions to policy problems. Numerous civil servants and think tank researchers told me during my 3 month stint that University academics just don’t have the desire to be engaged. But is there an intrinsic value to academic freedom that means we should balk at the idea of integrating with the public policy cycle?\nTowards Greater Societal Relevance?\nIn light of these problematic aspects of engaging with policymakers, perhaps we need to step back a bit and ask ourselves what the point of this ‘relevance’ debate really is. The question is precisely how political scientists, particularly those with fledgling careers increase our ‘impact’ and really make our research matter to society in an increasingly competitive and crowded marketplace?\nThis in turn leads to a more fundamental question about the meaning of ‘relevance’ itself. The rush towards greater ‘relevance’ is appealing – after all who would want to be seen as ‘irrelevant’? This does not, however, answer the question of how we wish to be more relevant, or indeed the question of who we wish to be relevant to. I found there was a great hunger for political scientists to become more ‘relevant’ by integrating research into the policy agenda of government, and sharing research skills. This is certainly a laudable form of relevance for political scientists to aspire to, but I also found myself craving something beyond influence within the Westminster bubble.\nThis policy-focused form of ‘relevance’ seems to overlook the broader role Flinders envisages, and also animates numerous young political scientists investigating contemporary issues like, for instance, immigration, environmental politics or global development. They want their findings to reach out beyond technocratic policy spheres to influence, somehow, the opinions of the general public.\nHow might we enhance the impact of political scientists beyond the policy sphere? Political scientists need to have a societal role promoting the public understanding of politics, talking in layman’s English that a variety of audiences can understand and perceive as relevant to their own circumstances. Such an agenda speaks to a desire to expand the public role of political scientists from the standard role of analysing elections or commenting in highbrow, niche Radio 4 programmes to debating on mainstream platforms like Question Time or Radio 5 Live, a role the majority of political scientists do not currently have.\nThere are cultural barriers that preclude political scientists breaking into this mainstream, as John argues. Yet, this does not imply we should lower our expectations of how great the impact of political science can potentially be both in the public and policy spheres. Culture changes, and so long as we are convinced of the importance of our subject then a more detailed analysis of how to capitalise on opportunities and overcome barriers both in the policy and public spheres should prove fruitful in increasing our overall ‘relevance’.\nNote: This article gives the views of the author(s), and not the position of the Impact of Social Sciences blog, nor of the London School of Economics", "id": "<urn:uuid:fa875e65-57e5-4eb8-888a-355e4cc63e2b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/05/30/insider-view-relevance-political-scientists-goverment/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:48:24Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9461068511009216, "token_count": 1819, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}
{"text": "Correctly identifying what is causing a problem is the most important step in pest control. We do our best here to help you do that. Sometimes we can identify the cause accurately enough from your phone or e-mail description of what is happening and what you see. Sometimes we can do this from photographs you submit, either electronically or printed on paper. But sometimes word descriptions and photographs aren't quite good enough, and we ask you to submit a specimen of an arthropod you have found, or the damage it has caused.\nThe information we give you is only as good as the information you give to us. I can't identify specimens that look like the one in the photograph above. Here are some hints that will help all of us:\n1. Make sure any photographs are CLEAR and take several, from very close up to farther away. Make sure you have sufficient light, or that you compensate with your camera to make sure we can clearly see what you are trying to show us. Learn how to use the close up mode on your digital camera.\n2. You have 20,000 of something flying around? Please give us at least - oh maybe - six of them. If it's something unusual, we need at least one full, intact set of key characteristics. If there are big individuals and little ones, try to submit a few of each size. Maybe they're different, maybe they're not, but we won't know for sure unless we see them.\n3. Label your material. Where and when was it found? What does it seem to be doing?\n4. You had 20,000 last week, but you can't find even one now? Maybe you don't have the problem anymore. Keep an eye on the situation and try not to worry.\n5. That doesn't go for termites. If you think you had a termite swarm, worry! Keep a close eye on it, try to find a least one, even if it's only a wing, and submit it for identification.\n6. You can kill most small pests by putting them in the freezer or by dropping them into alcohol. Any sort of alcohol will do. The alcohol not only kills them, it also preserves them. Never submit arthropod specimens in water (unless they are living aquatic animals). Moths and butterflies are easier to identify if they are not preserved in alcohol, so just freeze them and bring them in dry. We can also take live specimens.\n7. Some insects and mites are most easily submitted on or in a piece of the plant they are living on. It's best if the sample is as fresh as possible. Don't bake it in a hot car.\n8. A few creatures can't be identified from the sample you submit. Ants are most easily identified from the workers (the ones without the wings). Some spiders can only be identified to species if you have adults of both sexes. Small larvae, nymphs and eggs can be extremely difficult to identify. That's just the way it is.\n9. Entomologists specialize. Sometimes we have to send things off. If they only have to go to the university, turn-around time can be quick. If they have to go further, it may be a long time before you hear back.

{"text": "Modest swimwear has a pretty bad rap, especially online. Many a blogger without a topic to write about has, from time to time, relied on various \"modest\" contraptions to entertain his online audience. And frankly, one can see why: there is the swimsuit which resembles a beekeeper uniform, then the frightful housedress-and-wetsuit ensemble which, to me, evokes thoughts of polygamy more than going swimming--the list goes on and on. (My secret belief is that these atrocious ensembles are actually contrived by people trying to make modesty look bad, but of course this is difficult to confirm.)\nI have been reluctant to step into the fray, primarily because if one so much as mentions modest clothing nowadays, one is always accused of \"telling people what to wear.\" (Curiously, it doesn't work the other way 'round with those promoting revealing clothing, but that is a topic for another day.) Additionally, standards of external modesty differ, so instead of endorsing any particular clothing I have tried to focus my efforts on helping young people make better choices in their relationships in general.\nAnd yet, the majority of newcomers to this blog have alighted here after searching for modest bathing suits--or so I am told. Therefore I feel obliged to report on the new generation of modest activewear, the kind which will not cause you to flee in fear.\nOver the summer I have been conducting an informal contest of sorts, and the good news is that we have some winners. Modest activewear has come a long way since the \"Little House on the Prairie\" days. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)\nThe first item I tried out, which shall remain nameless to spare its creator any embarrassment, was a sort of culottes made from light grey nylon. The idea is great--a split skirt that resembles a skirt while walking, but when exercising, gives you the freedom of pants. As you may know, the original long split skirts were developed in the Victorian Era for horseback riding so that women could sit astride a saddle rather than having to ride side-saddle. Alas, this modern culottes adaptation, being made of nylon and Lycra, doesn't quite work in the execution: although the crotch seam is dropped considerably, it doesn't resemble a skirt (or pants, or really anything at all for that matter). The overall effect is what you might expect when a bunch of unflattering, stretchy material folds over in lumps, creases and rolls--and it is all attached to you. I knew something was wrong when my husband told me, \"It looks fine, darling--as long as you stay on the bike. Just whatever you do, don't get off the bike.\"\nThis was his subtle, super-nice way of signaling that this was not his favorite outfit. Needless to say, I moved on. Just because you have your counter-cultural tendencies doesn't mean you want to look like Weird Modest Girl. Or, for that matter, Ali Baba.\nBut then I discovered HydroChic. HydroChic sells a whole line of capris, swimshirts, and skirts that are meant to be worn without a bathing suit underneath. At left is one of their super-comfortable swim outfits (specifically, Seabreeze Sporty Stripe 3/4 Sleeve Swim Surf Top paired with Long Water Skirt/Attached Pants for coverage--comes with a sportswear swim-bra as well). I swam in it at the cottage, I wore it bike riding, and--this was truly the test--it held up while I was chasing after four little boys at the water park. I felt comfortable during all these activities, primarily because the high-quality stretch spandex/nylon combo dried off very quickly, but also because I didn't have to worry about sunscreen except for my face (the garment has a SPF of 50+). Best of all, with its fitted skirt and concealed nylon swim leggings, it really looks great. This was definitely one of my favorites this summer (although, no, that is not me in the picture).\nNow, I know some people searching for modest bathing suits are simply in the market for a cute retro one-piece à la ReVamp; then there are others who wouldn't consider the above outfit modest enough. I'm not here to judge. But if you're looking for something with a slightly longer skirt (HydroChic's longest just grazes the bottom of the knee) then Modiwear, maker of the blue suit at left, sells a bunch of different modest swim-and-activewear combos which hit well below the knee. Batsheva Asbell, the founder of Modiwear, sat down with me in her Toronto home and shared her journey to creating alternative swimwear that \"focused on the person rather than the body\":\n\"I was inspired by my experience at a separated women's beach in Ashdod [Israel]. The women were mostly from Jerusalem and wore robes and oversized T-shirts over their bathing suits. They couldn’t swim very well and although they were just thrilled to be in the water, they spent most of their time pulling their coverings down. In addition, I had heard a story of a woman in Florida who lost her life because her wet robe overtook her ability to keep herself from being pulled under. My conscience was hit and I felt obligated to make a difference. I call it a 'Modisuit' because it is flexible for an array of activities, and it included a world of women who were concerned not only about modesty, but also, those concerned about any medical issue.\"\nAlthough Modiwear's skirt is longer, it also features the stretch spandex/nylon skirt over thin leggings--a winning combination. Batsheva told me that a lot of women are wearing her suits \"to go to the waterpark, then go to a restaurant, and then go home.\" I suppose it depends on how fancy the restaurant is, but the garment does dry quickly, so you needn't put other clothing over something wet, nor change at all after swimming, necessarily--certainly a huge advantage when managing young children. Modiwear also makes children's suits which are adorable. (They don't have a website yet but you can email their office to find out more, or to place your orders here: email@example.com.)\nBut personally, I think it's well worth it. How many times have you heard women using modesty as an excuse not to get out there and get active?

{"text": "Guest post by Kristian Still. Kristian is from Wellington Academy and delivered a great BYOD session in the Microsoft Learn Live Theatre at Bett 2013.\nThis post was started on day 2 of BETT and finished on the train on the way home from BETT. I wanted a little time for my thoughts to ’brew,’ to see if I held the same view a day of two later, and I do. Here is why.\nPresenting as part of the Microsoft Education team is clearly going to be very different to experiencing a trade show as a delegate. First the day is longer, starting with geek chat over breakfast, the 9am debrief and wrapping up with the 6pm meeting. Second, it’s given me an insight into how ‘business and enterprise’ approach the education sector and the breadth / depth of Microsoft's interests, partnerships (OEM) and investments in education; hardware, cloud, coding (Kodu, Touch Develop), communications, teaching support (PiL) political dialogue and influence. Not to mention – all the meetings held behind the scenes, that we were not involved with or privy to.\nI am not for one-minute professing to understand the Microsoft business in just three and a half associated days, far from it, but what I do recognise and respect is, the commitment and the expertise of the Microsoft education team. This was best evidenced in how specialist staff responded to delegate questions and queries; carefully filtered or redirected to expert Microsoft staff (and remember we are only discussing just one division of Microsoft here).\nIn two days working along side the team, listening to their conversations with customers, I would urge school leaders to take advantage of their passion for their products and expertise. I was left with little doubt that Microsoft Education could have a positive impact on almost any school in the country given the opportunity - stretching the reducing budget, reducing IT staff workload, enlivening the curriculum (particularly Computer Science), developing teacher skills, extending the schools licensing agreements into the students homes.

{"text": "|Posted on Dec 13, 2011 10:53:40 AM | Jessica Nimon | 1 Comments ||\nThe Center for the Advancement of Science In Space, known as CASIS, introduced itself this fall to the community of existing National Lab partners as the new non-profit organization that will manage the National Lab on behalf of NASA. CASIS was founded specifically to fulfill the statutory requirement from Congress that a non-profit entity be engaged by NASA to stimulate, develop, and manage non-NASA U.S. use of the space station. On the NASA side, we are excited to start meeting our new CASIS colleagues as transition work begins.\nThe primary mission of CASIS is threefold:\n- Maximize the value of the space station to the nation through both research and development and STEM education activities.\n- Stimulate use of the station by other agencies, academia, and private firms.\n- Develop tools and techniques to communicate the value of the work done on the station and increase the return on the taxpayer investment.\nCASIS intends to accomplish this mission by building a strong, interconnected community, which ties together investigators at any level of progress down a particular research pathway, provides both private and public sources of funding, and engages experts in science and economics who can advise the community on technical matters and provide an independent valuation of a particular line of research.\nThese pathways will connect basic and applied research to the resulting mission and market applications. The goal is to shorten the overall cycle time by evaluating projects in terms of the bigger picture and with an understanding of their added value. As a non-profit, CASIS can also bring in visionary, speculative, and commercial funding sources, where appropriate, in the research process by recruiting backers who are seeking the value the project provides.\nThe International Space Station (NASA Image)\nCASIS will sponsor both a Science Collegium and an Economic Collegium to examine the scientific feasibility and economic value of proposals brought forward to the non-profit, using a value-added approach to complement scientific review, as well as proven algorithms for economic valuation. These valuation models will be benchmarked against real world data from existing National Lab partners before they are formally implemented.\nAll of these various elements will come together in what CASIS calls, the “Marketplace,” where researchers can seek funding and partnerships, implementation partners can offer their expertise with flight hardware and integration services, investors can look for promising opportunities, and all the various participants can negotiate innovative partnerships and collaborations with the help of CASIS.\nThrough its initial seed funding from NASA, as well as partnerships with private investors and other government agencies, CASIS will sponsor annual grant solicitations designed to bolster research lines, education programs, and technology development projects assessed by the Science and Economic Collegiums as having particular merit and value. This will continue over the 10-year cooperative agreement between NASA and CASIS, which has a five-year extension option.\nThe CASIS concept of operations will further develop over the next year as the organization grows and the Collegiums form. The transition will include CASIS progressively taking on more of the payload development support and research prioritization roles, while the International Space Station National Lab Office at NASA’s Johnson Space Center facilitates the handover with existing partners.\nLearn more and keep up-to-date with this promising new collaborative model between CASIS and NASA at: http://www.iss-casis.org/\nPresentations from the CASIS Kickoff Meeting can be found at: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/nlab/index.html\nThe Center for the Advancement of Science In Space, known as CASIS, official logo.\nJustin Kugler, strategic relationships manager for the International Space Station National Lab Office, worked with CASIS leaders in developing this initial blog.

(Grocery store sales were up an average of 6.7 percent.)\nSo, to try to combat this trend, a number of restaurants are cutting some pretty drastic deals in order to get patrons to fill their booths.\nOne that I ran into this weekend on OurFrugalJourney.com was a $5 off coupon on the purchase of any two adult entrees at Chili’s.\nIf you’re careful about what you buy (no sodas, no dessert), two people can walk away from dinner spending under $9 plus tax and tip.

Even Hooters is offering discounts in this recession: on Wednesdays, this “delightfully tacky” restaurant is offering 10 boneless wings and french fries for only $5.99.\nUPDATE: Ruby Tuesday has a coupon (I saw it today in the back of the local section of the Palm Beach Post) for a buy-one-entree-get-one-free deal.

{"text": "Randy Choate fumes, but Jack McKeon doesn’t care because Florida Marlins wonby Joe Capozzi\nLefty specialist Randy Choate didn’t mind so much the first time Marlins manager Jack McKeon pulled him from a game in the middle of a count against a batter.\nOn June 21, Choate was yanked with a 2-1 count against the Angels’ Alberto Callaspo, a switch hitter who was batting right-handed against the Marlins reliever.\nThe Marlins won, 5-2, to snap an 11-game losing streak in McKeon’s second game after he replaced Edwin Rodriguez.\nLast night, McKeon yanked Choate again in the middle of a count. This time, the reliever was not happy.\nWhat bothered him was that he was pulled after falling behind 2-0 against Lucas Duda, the Mets’ left-handed hitter. Choate has been stellar this year against lefty hitters, allowing just six hits and holding them to a .107 batting average.\n“When he did it to me the first time I wasn’t surprised, (because) it was a right handed hitter. I was little more surprised tonight with a lefty. I guess I’ll try to start getting them out,” Choate said after the 4-1 win.\nChoate initially said he didn’t want to talk when a reporter approached him post-game. He offered up sparse comments after more reporters showed up at his locker.\n“He pulled me out of the game. It’s the second time,” he said.\n“He’s the manager. I’m the player. He makes the call to the bullpen, I come off the mound.”\nAsked if the threat of being pulled makes it tough for a pitcher to focus on a hitter, Choate said: “It hasn’t all year, not usually. I was especially surprised this time, not so much last time.”\nAre you angry? “He’s the manager, I’m the player.’’\nWhen reporters went into McKeon’s office a few minutes later, the manager praised Choate’s performance.\n“Choate did a good job. He was being doing outstanding but I thought it was time for a change,” he said.\nThen McKeon made his point about having no qualms about doing what he thinks is right for the greater good of the team.\n“I’m interested in winning. I didn’t think he was sharp,” he said. And he had a point: Before Duda came to bat, Choate gave up a single to Willie Harris to open the bottom of the ninth with Florida up 4-0. It was just the sixth hit by a lefty hitter all year off Choate. But McKeon didn’t like Choate falling behind Duda 2-0.\n“I just didn’t want to see him walk this guy. I just didn’t think he was in the strike zone. Done it before, I’ll probably do it again.”\nMcKeon has done it before this year since taking over last month. He did during his first stint with the Marlins from 2003-05, even pulling Billy Koch in a 3-0 count once.\n“The name of the game is winning,” McKeon said last night. “I’m interested in winning. If the other guys are not interested in winning, then that’s their problem.\n“We’re interested in winning. We’re not worried about hurting anybodys feelings.

{"text": "Top to bottom, Dolphins rookie class proving its worth as season unfoldsby Brian Biggane\nIt takes time to evaluate any NFL rookie class. A training camp bust can quietly develop into a worthwhile contributor, while a guy who looks like he might be the real deal in meaningless preseason games often fades quickly as the real hitting begins.\nBut now, with the season one game short of three-quarters complete, it’s become clear the Dolphins are getting a lot out of the Class of 2011.\nA round-by-round assessment:\n1 _ Center Mike Pouncey might have been the safest pick of the entire draft. His twin brother Maurkice made the Pro Bowl as a rookie with Pittsburgh last year and Mike had the same work ethic, attitude and intelligence when he arrived. The absence of offseason workouts certainly slowed his progress, but Pouncey earned raves from quarterbacks Chad Henne and Matt Moore for how quickly he picked up the schemes and was able to make the calls for the rest of the line. He’s as much a keeper as Jake Long.\n2 _ Running back Daniel Thomas would probably tell you this was a lost year due to a nagging hamstring injury that has limited his availability, but Thomas still led AFC rookies in rushing entering the weekend with 406 yards, then picked up another 25 on six carries against Dallas Thursday. He’s not DeMarco Murray, the former Oklahoma star whom the Cowboys selected after him, but he should finish with a respectable 600-700 yards this year, not bad considering Reggie Bush has been the feature back all year.\n4 _ With no third-rounder, Clyde Gates is up next, and Gates’ stock made a significant jump in the Dallas game. His 39-yard kickoff return with under a minute left in the half set Miami up at its 44, from where Moore directed a 46-yard drive in seven plays to a Shayne Graham 28-yard field goal that cut the Cowboys’ lead to 10-6. Gates also did a good job blocking on a few runs and made an 11-yard reception. He’s still very raw and a work in progress, but look for the Dolphins to utilize his speed more going forward.\n6 _ The role of tight end/H-back Charles Clay continues to evolve as Moore and offensive coordinator Brian Daboll keep finding ways to use him. He’s got excellent hands, good speed and is a load to bring down. Hardly a blip on the radar in the early weeks of the season, he’s become another weapon in the offense and also has earned an expanded role.\n7 _ Cornerback Jimmy Wilson has largely faded from the picture since injuries to Vontae Davis and Nolan Carroll forced him into a starting role a few weeks back. He did make an excellent play on a Brandon Fields punt in the first quarter Thursday, jumping into the end zone and knocking the ball back so Julius Pruitt could down it at the 3. The question going forward is whether Wilson will ever progress to where he can fill a starting job. But it’s a plus to get anything out of a seventh-rounder, and Wilson looks like he’ll be no worse than a quality backup.\nWhile the only starter in the group is Pouncey _ thanks in great part to the development of Bush as a feature back, at least for now _ General Manager Jeff Ireland’s first draft without Bill Parcells hovering over his every move has been impressive, mostly adding depth in areas the Dolphins needed it and finding an anchor for the O-line for years to come.\nWill it be enough to save Ireland’s job after previous mistakes like Pat White, Patrick Turner and 2008 fourth-rounder Shawn Murphy? That remains to be seen. But on its own merit it’s a job well done.\nTags: Bill Parcells, Brian Daboll, Brrandon Fields, Chad Henne, Charles Clay, Clyde Gates, Daniel Thomas, DeMarco Murray, Jake Long, Jeff Ireland, Jimmy Wilson, Julius Pruitt, Matt Moore, Mike Pouncey, Nolan Carroll, Pat White, Patrick Turner, Reggie Bush, Shawn Murphy, Shayne Graham, Vontae Davis", "id": "<urn:uuid:9c4845f8-ce40-4083-a8a9-f6c6d92f17f5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.palmbeachpost.com/thedailydolphin/2011/11/26/top-to-bottom-dolphins-rookie-class-proving-its-worth-as-season-unfolds/?cp=2", "date": "2013-05-18T06:44:33Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9614993929862976, "token_count": 863, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "“A Fine Addition: New & Notable Acquisitions in Princeton’s Special Collections” highlights recent additions to the holdings of the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, including the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library, as well as the Marquand Library of Art and Archaeology. The exhibition is on view through August 5 in the Main Gallery of the Firestone Library.\nOne highlight among many on display is a copy of Andreas Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica, first published in Basel in 1543 (read more about the recent acquisition of the first and second edition here). At the official opening on Sunday, April 22, Dr. Eugene Flamm ’58, Jeffrey P. Bergstein Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, will highlight Princeton’s recent anatomical and phrenological acquisitions with a talk investigating “Observational and Imaginary Anatomy.” The lecture at 2:30 p.m. in Betts Auditorium will be followed by a reception in the Main Gallery. The exhibition and its related events are free and open to the public thanks to the generous support of the Friends of the Princeton University Library.\nA Fine Addition: New & Notable Acquisitions in Princeton’s Special Collections\nAntiquarian booksellers’ catalogs are rife with superlatives: “The finest copy known,” “a splendid example,” “a fine edition of this extraordinary work.” Yet, exceptional rarity and condition are not sufficient justifications for choosing to acquire one item rather than another. How do curators, librarians, and archivists look beyond a “fine edition” and select items that represent a fine addition to collections as vast and diverse as Princeton’s?\nBuilding on strength is one obvious approach. To Princeton’s extensive holdings of literary archives come new additions to collections of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Recent additions to the University Archives and the Public Policy Papers highlight pivotal moments in the twentieth century: Princeton’s contributions to the Manhattan Project and Secretary of State James A. Baker III’s reactions to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the beginning of Operation Desert Storm. And the Cotsen Children’s Library has complemented some of its important series of picture books with the acquisition of original artwork for them, such as the archive of drawings for the 34-volume Gerlach Jugendbücherei (1900–1920) and Nathalie Chelpanova Parain’s drawings and unbound dummy for the French-language edition of Baba Yaga (Paris, 1932).\nEarly New Jersey and Revolutionary America have always been well represented at Princeton. A recently acquired map of Pennsylvania from 1791 contains the earliest American illustration of a canal; the map once belonged to Robert Lettis Hooper, a New Jersey patriot who served as deputy quartermaster general in the Continental Army. Even a Western Americana addition has a New Jersey connection: The Yo-Hamite Falls, a lithograph made in 1855 from a drawing by New Jersey native Thomas Ayres, was the first published image of Yosemite Falls.\nIf the pillars of a collection are easily perceived, so are its gaps. A notable omission among Princeton’s landmarks in the history of science has been corrected with the purchase of the first and second editions of Andreas Vesalius’s monumental anatomical treatise, De humani corporis fabrica (Venice, 1543 and 1555). Recent complements to Vesalius in the Graphic Arts Collection and Marquand Library are the original woodblock used for the frontispiece of Realdo Colombo’s De re anatomica (Venice, 1599) and Pietro da Cortona’s Tabulae anatomicae (Rome, 1741).\nEmerging areas of scholarship also influence collecting choices. Over the past decade the Numismatic Collection has been acquiring coins to illustrate the monetary interrelationships throughout the Mediterranean area in the later Middle Ages. Princeton’s example of a gold florin issued in Clarentza is only the third known extant specimen. The Marquand Library has added first editions of the most renowned works of woodblock print artists Katsushika Hokusai and Kitagawa Utamaro. Hokusai’s experimentation with the “colors” of black ink and Utamaro’s mica-sprinkled images can be truly appreciated only in these originals. Likewise, scholars wishing to study the beginnings of the modern artist’s book (livre d’artiste) can turn to the Graphic Arts Collection to find Pierre Bonnard’s personal copy of his masterpiece, Parallèlement (Paris, 1900).\nCurators, librarians, and archivists strive to enrich collections by acquiring materials that build on existing strengths, fill perceived gaps, and assist new paths of teaching and scholarship. The diverse acquisitions on display do just that, presenting fine additions to a fine collection.", "id": "<urn:uuid:24a30eb4-cb78-4cd3-a761-d93edca4632f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.princeton.edu/rbscreference/2012/02/a-fine-addition/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9014366269111633, "token_count": 1074, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "There are many schools of thought on how to conduct therapy. A new dichotomy seems to be growing between those who favor tough love and those who focus on acceptance.\nIn a recent Wall Street Journal Article, clients and therapists discuss how with “tough love” therapists try to eliminate their client’s whining. These therapists might limit what topics a client can discuss or confront a client who is “whining” about their life again. One client says she needs this sort of therapy. That she simply won’t change if she receives unconditional acceptance.\nAnd this client is likely right. Unconditional acceptance alone typically doesn’t result in change. But, although confrontation and demanding change does, often, lead to positive life changes, it can also leave clients feeling resentful, angry at therapists and misunderstood.\nThe reality is that change is hard. And therapy is often hard because it is typically an agent of change. We want to feel better, cope better, relate to others better and make positive life changes. Therapy can help us do that with a mixture of unconditional acceptance and a more directed focus on change.\nTough love is important, but so is understanding and acceptance.

{"text": "Bharti Airtel offers $10.7 billion to pursue dream\nBharti Airtel may be about to realize its dream of becoming an emerging market telecom giant. India’s largest cellphone operator has made a $10.7 billion non-binding offer to buy most of Kuwaiti rival Zain’s African assets. The deal would add 40 percent to Bharti’s current enterprise value.\nThe potential transaction appears to have the support of Zain’s board. Bharti’s challenge, however, will be convincing its own investors that the African adventure is worthwhile. They wiped 9.2 percent off the company’s shares on Monday following the announcement that the two companies were in talks.\nThat reaction might seem excessive. The valuation for Zain, eight times the company’s expected $1.3 billion earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2010, is roughly in line with recent comparable transactions. Global giant Vodafone paid around that multiple for South Africa’s Vodacom in 2008 and the Cambodian operations of emerging market operator Millicom fetched around seven times EBITDA in November.\nAnd Bharti could raise the funds for the purchase without breaking its balance sheet. The company currently has debt of only 0.4 times its $3.5 billion estimated 2010 EBITDA. It could raise roughly $13 billion and still end up with the same leverage – three times the enlarged group’s EBITDA – as smaller Indian rival Reliance Communications.\nYet that level of leverage could prove too high for Bharti. Zain’s African operations need heavy investment. In Nigeria, the continent’s fastest growing market, Zain has been losing customers and is struggling to turn around the business. The management of Bharti, experienced in rolling out networks in low-cost markets, is well placed for the challenge – but it will be expensive.\nIf Bharti decides to settle on a lower level of debt – say twice its EBITDA – it will have to raise roughly $2.4 billion selling stock in order to fund the purchase of Zain. Bharti has until March 25, when its exclusivity period with Zain expires, to square the financing circle.\nSingapore Telecom, Bharti’s second largest shareholder with an indirect 30 percent stake, could play a role. But investors are worrying that the Indian operator, which twice failed to seal a deal with South Africa’s MTN, will stretch too far for an African deal.", "id": "<urn:uuid:63debbda-5e15-4e87-ae6f-f823730b00b4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2010/02/15/bharti-airtel-offers-10-7-billion-to-pursue-dream/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:23:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9545584917068481, "token_count": 543, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Europeans must not let their “Washington Intervention” go to waste\nBy Mohamed El-Erian\nThe opinions expressed are his own.\nEuropean officials must feel like that they were just on the receiving end of an “intervention” staged by their colleagues from other countries – a process whereby a group of people come together to “shock” a friend/family member into recognizing the depth of a personal crisis and the urgency of embarking on proper corrective actions.\nThe venue was this past weekend’s Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank. This event brings together policymakers from almost 190 countries, along with business leaders and media. It is full of formal meetings, seminars, press conferences, and bilateral discussions.\nIt is a well-attended gathering that serves many purposes. One of them is to enable policymakers to collectively get a feel for the state of a highly inter-connected and complex global economy. At times in the past, this has proved absolutely critical for designing policy responses that avoided terrible collective outcomes.\nThis was certainly the case in 2008. On that occasion, a series of consultations and discussions led policymakers from around the world to the startling conclusion that, after the disorderly collapse of Lehman Brothers, the global economy risked tipping into a great depression.\nThe follow-up was one of the most impressive examples of global policy coordination that culminated in the highly successful G-20 Summit in London in April 2009. The world averted an economic depression that would have spread unemployment, poverty and misery all over the world.\nUnfortunately, it did not take long for such coordination to give way to competing and, at times, conflicting national agendas and narratives. This was particularly true in America and Europe where policymakers failed to understand and act on consequential global and national realignments.\nToday the global economy is highly vulnerable to major dislocations on account of three distinct but mutually reinforcing problems: a sovereign debt crisis (whose epicenter is in Europe), banking system fragilities (Europe), and an inability to grow robustly (America and Europe).\nAs Europe features in all three, it should come as no surprise that European officials were approached by lots of people this weekend in Washington. Many wanted to understand what the European policymakers had in mind; and they wished to ring a very loud alarm that would spur these officials into bold and decisive action.\nWherever they turned, European officials heard a consistent message which typically consisted of four specific points:\n• The bickering and dithering of European politicians and policymakers have allowed the crisis that originated in Greece to spread too far and wide;\n• The crisis is has now gotten close — far too close — to being uncontrollable;\n• Virtually no country in the world would be immune from the adverse consequences; and, therefore,\n• Europe needs to finally step up with decisive policies that are underpinned by a common political vision of what the Eurozone should look like in five years time.\nInitially, the reactions of most Europeans ran the gambit: from denying the severity of the crisis to diverting the blame elsewhere. Some hit back, noting that they were neither blind nor deaf. By the end of the meeting, however, most seem to have heard the messages, taken them to heart, and indicated their intention to act on them.\nRecognition and proper diagnosis are essential components of a durable solution to a problem. It is therefore good news for the global economy that, especially after this weekend, there is little doubt in the mind of Europeans about the urgency of their situation. They also know that the world is watching and hoping.\nIt is also good news that some key officials even went so far as to identify a timetable for action – the six-week run-up to the next G-20 meeting in France. True, it is a timetable that is excessively influenced by political considerations rather than economic and financial ones. As such, it may be challenged by markets that are unsettled by fragilities in both sovereign debt and banking systems.\nSo, will this Washington intervention and timetable hold? The answer depends on five key issues:\nFirst, the Europeans must take immediate — and I stress immediate — actions to stabilize the banking system and counter more effectively the persistent recent rise in yields on government debt issued by Italy and Spain in particular. This cannot wait six weeks.\nSecond, they must quickly come up with operational mechanisms that build secure firewalls around at least one highly troubled country (Greece) so that it can default without triggering a tsunami for others in the Eurozone.\nThis will only be possible if, and this is the third point, the European Central Bank (which has been carrying most of the burden so far) receives much more support from national fiscal and regulatory authorities.\nFourth, bold structural decisions must be taken to strengthen the architecture and functioning of what, in the final analysis, is likely to be a smaller, less imperfect and stronger Eurozone.\nFinally, politicians must secure the airspace for the technocrats that are waging difficult day-to-day battles through better communication, a common vision and a unified purpose.\nThis is quite a list, and there is very little time to waste.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2a6bdfc2-c71d-4b1d-bf92-97d4a11617ed>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.reuters.com/mohamed-el-erian/2011/09/26/europeans-must-not-let-their-%E2%80%9Cwashington-intervention%E2%80%9D-go-to-waste/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:46:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9628384709358215, "token_count": 1058, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Father/Daughter Records Is a Family Affair\nMany local labels are offering obscure reissues and innovative new releases on all conceivable formats. Label Sampler is an occasional column that profiles a different Bay Area independent label in each edition.\nFather/Daughter's Jessi Frick\nName: Father/Daughter Records\nHeadquarters: Spare room, Inner Sunset, San Francisco\nOwners: Jessi Frick and Ken Hector.\nLabel one-sheet: Father/Daughter is a small indie pop label run by a father in Florida and his daughter in San Francisco.\nCreation story: Yes, a father and daughter teamed up to found a record label. They live on separate sides of the country, but the distance allows each owner to be scouting talent on their respective coast to potentially add to the label's roster. Cutely, they assert that the label endeavor is a means of bringing the family closer together over a mutual love of the artists they choose to invest in. Early on, Frick recalls having difficulty convincing bands to release on her label, but that only led her to hone artist relationships based on trust and mutual respect. Father/Daughter has slowly built a stable of releases at about the rate of a single for every season since its founding in 2009.\nFrick's appreciation of personal character: In discussing nearly every group on her label, Frick inevitably mentions what pleasant and thoughtful people the musicians are, implying a criterion for selection that other labels might shirk. \"They're two of the kindest people I know,\" Frick says of Pure Bathing Culture, Father/Daughter's recent signees from Portland. \"I'm stoked to help nurture them.\" Likewise, she describes making the acquaintance her first signee, Family Trees, as if making new friends: \"I finally got the chance to meet them over beers and snacks and instantly hit it off.\" Signing artists is often discussed by label representatives in an austere, businesslike tone -- which makes Frick's insistence on actually enjoying the company of artists on her roster particularly refreshing.\nMusical focus: As Frick explains, \"Like Faygo, Father/Daughter is an eclectic brand of pop.\" Indeed, its releases include Pure Bathing Culture's lush chamber pop, Leapling's electro-pop, and Cocktails' soulful roots-rock. There is a particular emphasis on mellowness in Father/Daughter's catalog, and much of the label's releases would flow together seamlessly on a single mix tape.\nUpcoming release: Cocktails, a brand new San Francisco group who've left strong impressions on attendees of their numerous recent shows, will soon release their debut single on Father/Daughter. With their clear affinity for traditional rock 'n' roll and soulful vocal styling, Cocktails command an effective pop sensibility that's driven home by the sheer earnestness and conviction evident in each track.\nAttitude toward the Internet: Frick fondly recalls discovering music via fanzines and word of mouth while she was in high school, but like so many new label owners, regards the Internet as a superior means to the same end. Impressively, Father/Daughter's Twitter feed, Facebook updates, and blog-style website rivals the slickness and presence of labels many times its size. A built in media player graces the label's sleek home page, and separate contacts are provided for licensing -- surprising features for a label with hardly more than 10 releases. The imprint's releases don't go unnoticed, though. For example, the A-side of its third record, a single from mildly minimal pop artist Levek, was recently featured in an ad for Apple's MacBook Pro.\nSan Francisco's resources: Father/Daughter outsources most of its manufacturing to local businesses and is quick to voice appreciation for the community of other small labels with comparable goals. As Frick explains, \"The Bay Area most definitely has a hand in helping the label thrive. It's amazing to be a part of such a close knit and welcoming community of labels... vinyl manufacturers [like] Pirates [Press,] record stores, booking agents, venues, bloggers and bands.\"\nPrimary format: Father/Daughter is enamored with vinyl. So much so, in fact, that Frick describes the record shopping experience in revelatory terms. \"The entire ritual of going to the store, flipping through the bins, taking the record home, opening it, being able to swoon over the big, beautiful cover, it's such a satisfying feeling.\" She adds as an afterthought, \"Vinyl sounds exponentially better than that digital crap.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:0b284049-eef3-4d52-bbef-7e95f563cbda>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2012/11/father_daughter_records.php", "date": "2013-05-18T05:54:05Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9468413591384888, "token_count": 947, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "September 27, 2011\nDiosa Costello was the first Latina on Broadway. She was a pioneering night club performer. As a producer and club owner, she set trends in entertainment; as a film star and popular musician, she personified them. “I was the original J. Lo.,” Costello says. Last week, as part of an on-stage program and conversation with curators, she donated a set of 11 stage costumes from her storied career to the American History Museum.\nThe 94-year-0ld Costello grew up in Puerto Rico, performing for her father sick in bed and soldiers on the street . “I was born dancing,” she says. “All my life I danced.” After moving to New York with her family as a teenager, she worked her way up the ranks, catching a major break when she was cast in the Broadway musical Too Many Girls.\nDuring her long and diverse career, she would record music, appear in Hollywood films, perform alongside Rodney Dangerfield in Catskills comedy clubs and launch Desi Arnaz to fame. In an era when racial diversity was nonexistent on stage, she performed as everything from Latina stereotypes to a Pacific islander, as “Bloody Mary” in South Pacific.\nHer routines, in particular, were remarkably racy for the time. “I would stick my behind out, and I put a glass of water on top of it. When I was dancing all over the place, and I didn’t spill one drop,” Costello says. “I’m very uninhibited. If I think something, I do it.”\n“She is a pioneering performer and a significant figure in American entertainment,” says Dwight Blocker Bowers, a curator of the American History Museum’s entertainment collection. He hopes that, after renovations that will create a larger exhibition space for the popular culture artifacts, the museum will be able to put Costello’s costumes on display.\nDespite her longevity and popularity, Costello never expected for her work to be honored in the Smithsonian. “I’ll tell you, I didn’t even know. I had never been to a museum, I didn’t even know what the heck it was all about,” she says. But Bowers feels the honor is fitting for a career of Costello’s magnitude. “You’re a legend,” he says, “to us and to the American people.”\nIn the upcoming November issue of Smithsonian, don’t miss Around the Mall’s Q&A with Diosa Costello.\nSign up for our free email newsletter and receive the best stories from Smithsonian.com each week.\nNo Comments »\nNo comments yet.", "id": "<urn:uuid:3553e417-acee-48f2-bdf6-645d79ac5873>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/aroundthemall/2011/09/legendary-performer-diosa-costello-donates-wardrobe-to-smithsonian/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:09:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9714580774307251, "token_count": 591, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean"]}

{"text": "President Lyndon Johnson and the “best and the brightest” who staffed his administration led this country into three quagmires. By far the most famous, but perhaps not the most expensive and dangerous resulted from LBJ’s escalation of the Vietnam War. More than 50,000 Americans and many more Vietnamese died as a result of that policy; our country was bitterly divided in ways that still weaken us today, and the economic cost of the war was immense. It contributed to the wave of inflation that shook the country in the 1970s and in addition to the interest on the debt from this ill-starred venture we are still paying (as we certainly should) pensions and medical costs for the vets and their spouses.\nThe Second Great Johnson Quagmire now destroying the nation is the Medicare/Medicaid complex. These entitlement programs are the biggest single financial problem we face. They dwarf all the Bush-Obama wars; they make TARP look like small change. They not only cost money we don’t have — and are scheduled to cost inexorably more until they literally ruin the nation — they have distorted our entire health system into the world’s most bloated and expensive monstrosity. Thanks to these programs, we have a health system that marries the greed of the private sector to the ineptitude of government, and unless we can somehow tame these beasts America and everything it stands for could be lost. (Note, please, that by comparison Social Security can be relatively easily reformed to be solvent for the next 75 years. The New Deal, whatever its shortcomings, was almost infinitely more realistic and sustainable than the Great Society.)\nLBJ Signing the Medicare Bill (Source: Wikimedia Commons)\nBut that is a subject for another day. The third Johnson Quagmire is the War on Poverty, and specifically the attempt to treat inner city poverty primarily as a racial problem. After the Medicare/Medicaid catastrophe the single greatest policy failure of modern America is urban policy. Since the Great Society era of Lyndon Johnson, the country has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into poor urban neighborhoods. The violence and crime generated in these neighborhoods costs hundreds of billions more. And after all this time, all this money and all this energy, the inner city populations are worse off than before. There is more drug addiction and more social and family breakdown among this population than when the Great Society was launched. Incarceration rates have risen to levels that shock the world (though they make for safer streets); the inner city abortion rate has reached levels that must surely appall even the most resolute pro-choicers not on the Planned Parenthood payroll. Forty percent of all pregnancies in New York end in abortion, with higher rates among Blacks; nationally, the rate among Blacks is three times the rate among white women. Put it all together and you have a holocaust of youth and hope on a scale hard to match.\nThis is not a lot to show for almost fifty years of fighting poverty — not a lot of bang for the buck.\nWe need to do better. The state of the American inner city is an unacceptable human tragedy, and the costs in money spent and prosperity forfeited create an unsustainable drag on the national economy at a time when we need all the help we can get.\nThere is more. Those neighborhoods — and the prisons in which so many young urban men spend large chunks of their lives — threaten the peace and security of the country as a whole. Extremist cults, some domestically based and others relying on foreign money and enthusiasm, fish in these troubled waters for souls, and sometimes they catch a few. This could turn ugly. An old friend who has spent much of his life fighting violence and extremism in the inner city puts the danger like this: think about “The Wire” and think about all the talent, ingenuity and training that goes into the drug gangs. Think about their ability to operate in defiance of the police, think about their connections with international crime and the amount of money they can raise.\nNow think about what life would be like in this country if the leaders of those groups embraced violent religious extremism and sought, as many have done overseas, to finance a terror campaign through drug money.\nThis is, I believe, a serious threat down the road; there are already a few early warning signs and while we should not be stampeded into panic about them, the situation is one to watch with concern. Where there is no real hope, people clutch at straws — and on present trends conditions in the inner cities are likely to get significantly worse. Bad and dysfunctional as the remaining Great Society programs are, we are entering an era of government budget cutting. Given the power that unions, middle class and elite lobbies have, inner city residents stand to take a disproportionate share of any cuts. If it’s a choice between helping poor children in the inner city or paying inflated pensions to retired union workers, where will the politicians come down?\nThe Great Society legacy is not all bad. The voting rights legislation and the affirmative action programs introduced at that time helped a solid African-American middle class to expand. Increasingly, the country now has second and third generations of African-American families who have college educations and who are represented at all levels of business, the professions, politics and the arts.\nNot that the Great Society deserves as much credit as its backers like to claim. Most of African-American progress since 1965 is due to the dogged hard work of people determined to change their own lives. Government action did play a role, but clearly racial attitudes in the United States have dramatically changed, perhaps especially so among conservatives. When conservative Republicans whose parents were Dixiecrat segregationists cheering on Lester Maddox now swoon at the rhetoric of Herman Cain, give standing ovations to Condoleezza Rice, write angry letters to editors when liberal journalists attack Clarence Thomas and elect an African American Republican to the House of Representatives from Charleston, SC, we must recognize that something has changed.\nIn any case, the Johnson-era approach to urban poverty was largely predicated on the idea that our urban problems were a race and justice problem. Discrimination in housing, jobs and education had created the “ghetto”; ending those practices, compensating for them through affirmative action and providing infusions of cash to jump start urban investment and “renew” down at heels urban neighborhoods would win the war on urban poverty.\nTo the extent these ideas and the policies they inspired had merit, things got better. The middle class grew and many African Americans moved out of segregated neighborhoods and public housing projects into the suburbs. But this wasn’t the whole story, and even as Great Society era programs worked for some, conditions in the inner cities worsened for many who remained.\nThe result is the urban quagmire in which we now find ourselves. We are spending massive amounts of money and conditions are getting worse. Liberals recognize this as a problem in Afghanistan; they are more reluctant to see it in St. Louis — but it is true. What we are doing now isn’t working and while some of the reforms being tried (especially in education and perhaps also new ways of handling drug issues) offer promise, there is no light at the end of the urban tunnel.\nThe urban quagmire into which the Johnson administration (blue thought at its zenith) led the United States reflects a massive intellectual failure. We still have racial problems in this country, but the urban problem at its core about much more than race. To think clearly about the inner cities, we are going to have learn to think less racially — to for example learn to think about our inner city problem as if most of the urban poor were white.\nInner Cities in Context\nThe first step is to put the African-American presence in the cities in historical context. The Great Migration of African-Americans from southern farms to northern cities was one of many such movements in the modern era. For hundreds of years now, changes in agriculture have been sending people from the countryside into the city. The rising productivity of agricultural workers, the growing concentration of land ownership in the hands of well-capitalized large proprietors and the mechanization of farm work meant that peasants have been leaving the field for the city all over the world.\nThe African American urban migration was one of these mass movements of population. It was not unlike waves of migration to the US from much of Europe; farmers and farm workers were either pushed off the land or drawn to the possibilities of urban life and many of them came to America’s burgeoning cities in search of better lives. As cotton culture was mechanized and sharecropping gave way to large estates directly worked by the owner, millions of African-Americans streamed to northern cities between 1910 and the 1960s just as Italians, Greeks, Russians, Poles and Jews had done between the Civil War and the immigration restrictions of the 1920s.\nWe are, incidentally, seeing many more Great Migrations today: in North America we have rural Mexicans and Central Americans are streaming into cities in Mexico and across the US. The Turkish migration into Germany followed this pattern; much of the North African migration to western Europe and the internal Chinese migration from country to city is of this kind as well. Rural migrants are swelling the population of African cities from Capetown to Cairo; they are filling the cities of South and Central Asia. Globally we are in the middle of a Great Migration that sometime in this century will put a majority of the world’s population into cities for the first time ever.\nHistorically, cities were tough places to move to. Back in the eighteenth century and in most of the nineteenth, mortality rates were often higher and in many cases much higher in cities than in rural areas. Sanitation was primitive; food transport was slow and uncertain and refrigeration did not exist. Social safety nets were porous and weak. The cities were regularly scourged by disease and fire. Urban populations tended to shrink in those years if not continually renewed by fresh migrants from the countryside.\nEconomically and culturally it wasn’t easy, either. Back in the country, young people (the bulk of the migrants then and now) were integrated into strong social patterns. They were mostly honest and hardworking. There were relatively few opportunities for the sons and daughters of poor peasants and laborers to be anything else.\nWhen they got to the city, there were no strong extended family networks to provide a social safety net in bad times — or to enforce social discipline and healthy habits in good ones. Cities, classically, have more temptations than the country does — that is one reason adventurous young people in particular like to move to them. With no social safety net, no public health and no support system, many migrants became statistics on the urban mortality rolls. Drinking badly made gin, eating poorly preserved and often contaminated food, and living in unsanitary neighborhoods was not a recipe for longevity. Throw in venereal disease in an era that knew very little about prevention or treatment, and it is easy to understand why cities needed constant replenishment from the countryside.\nA 1751 engraving of Gin Lane by William Hogarth (Source: Wikimedia Commons)\nThe old urban migration was a kind of Darwinian test. Migrants had to maintain their social discipline and sharply limit their indulgences in the dangerous but alluring diversions of urban life. Failing to do that meant an early and often very unpleasant death.\nThe growing European cities of the eighteenth and early to mid-nineteenth century had what Marx called a lumpenproletariat of deracinated residents who had lost their footing in the country but been unable to establish themselves on steady terms in the city. They were the petty thieves, prostitutes and hustlers of the day — the pages of Dickens are full of them. Their numbers tended to grow as the pace of urbanization sped up, but epidemics and hunger continued to take their toll.\nBeginning in the nineteenth century and continuing through to the present day, urban demography changed. Mortality rates in cities dropped as people grew to understand the importance of clean water, learned how to fight or prevent infectious disease and the quality of the food supply dramatically improved. Add the provision of a social safety net and the conditions existed for what we have seen: the development of a cycle of urban poverty spanning many generations.\nWhen the Great Migration of rural African-Americans came north, beginning around World War One, they were more like the Mexican immigrants of today than like a Marxist lumpenproletariat. By and large they were hard working and clean living people who were willing and able to work at sometimes backbreaking jobs to provide for their families. Despite the corrosive effect that slavery had on family ties and despite the inevitable strains that great poverty places on family life, African American family ties were much stronger then than they are in today’s inner city.\nMany African Americans established themselves in urban middle class communities; Harlem and Queens (this most glamorous and cosmopolitan of New York boroughs included Jackie Robinson, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Malcolm X among its residents) contained vibrant, exciting and safe neighborhoods. Schools often worked much better than many do now; the social infrastructure of African-American neighborhoods was comparable and in some cases stronger than in other neighborhoods of recent urban immigrants from around the world.\nThe Louis Armstong House in Corona, Queens (Source: Wikimedia Commons)\nOver time, two trends appear in such neighborhoods. Some residents (luckier or more talented) establish secure lives in the urban economy. Over time they tend to move away from the old neighborhoods to less crowded parts of the city and to the suburbs. Those who do not for whatever reason make this transition successfully begin to lose the inherited culture and discipline of the country. In the old days a high mortality (and high infant mortality) rate would limit this population. These days, though abortion, violence, drug addiction and crime take a toll, the modern scourges are less effective than the older ones and many more people survive physically in the city while failing to find secure livelihoods there. As one dysfunctional generation gives rise to another, inherited social structures weaken further, and we see what we see.\nAfrican Americans formed the first nucleus of what is likely to be an ongoing underclass not so much because of their skin color (though with many craft unions and employers holding to white only hiring practices discrimination had an effect) as because of their timing. African Americans were the last wave of migrants to hit the American industrial belt; while the 1920s immigration laws cut the flow of European immigrants to a trickle, the African American influx continued into the years when American factory employment stagnated and then began its (so far) inexorable decline. Black America showed up for the party just as the bar was closing down.\nMany African Americans transitioned to the modern economy. Even as factories stopped taking on new workers and laying off old ones, African Americans went to college in record numbers. Like second and third generation European migrants to city life before them, they found middle class jobs on police forces, in schools, in fire departments, sanitation departments and in the civil service. Some pursued military careers and others went into business, finance, politics and law.\nA critical mass, however, did not make the adjustment in time. Early generations of American immigrants headed quickly from the cities onto family farms up through the Civil War; from the Civil War through the Vietnam era the factories provided a bridge into the middle class. For the last forty years that avenue has been closed; new waves of immigrants have been forced to find new paths into the middle class. For some, it is proving difficult, and we have already seen the signs of social and family breakdown and a growing gang culture among some newer immigrant groups.\nOnce a community has reached the levels of dysfunction and defeat that characterizes the third, fourth and fifth generations of the modern American underclass, conventional social programs no longer work particularly well. Affirmative action does not help a thirty year old illiterate with a drug habit get a job. The most dedicated teachers in the best schools cannot compensate for the lack of basic parenting at home. A community of young men who have never known a father’s care or even seen a father caring for a family cannot be prepared for adult life by anything the government can do.\nThere are no magic solutions to problems this deeply rooted, but we are going to dispel the shadow of LBJ from our urban policy and find new approaches to urban problems that break with the core assumptions of the catastrophically wrongheaded ‘best and the brightest’ of the 1960s. Thinking less racially about urban problems is part of the answer; in future posts I will make more suggestions. This is a complicated subject and clear answers are not easy to find; I will be looking to responses from readers to help me figure things out.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1b3e6e4b-dfae-40dd-a9aa-ee11a16942d4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2011/07/04/the-shame-of-the-cities-and-the-shade-of-lbj/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9688898324966431, "token_count": 3448, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Air Canada Threatens to Withdraw NHL Sponsorship Over Headshots\nAccording to a report from Bruce Garrioch of QMI Agency, Air Canada issued a threat to withdraw its sponsorship of the NHL if the league doesn’t take “immediate” and “serious” action against headshots. In a letter to Gary Bettman, Denis Vandal, Air Canada’s director of marketing/communications, voiced the company’s concerns over the rising number of violent incidents in the NHL and Zdeno Chara’s hit on Max Pacioretty specifically.\n“From a corporate social responsibility standpoint, it is becoming increasingly difficult to associate our brand with sports events which could lead to serious and irresponsible accidents; action must be taken by the NHL before we are encountered with a fatality.\n“Unless the NHL takes immediate action with serious suspension to the players in question to curtail these life-threatening injuries, Air Canada will withdraw its sponsorship of hockey.”\nAir Canada owns the naming rights to the Toronto Maple Leafs home arena as well as providing sponsorship to all six Canadian teams, according to Garrioch’s report. It’s hard to disagree with the message that Air Canada is trying to put across here, but their execution leaves something to be desired. Some influential members of the hockey media sphere were quick to brush this off as little more than a PR stunt via Twitter, and some took an even more cynical approach and deemed the Montreal based corporation’s tactic as hometown heroism.\nLike they say, if you really want to something to change then you best do something about it. Air Canada’s threat has the right message, but it’s awfully difficult to envision the NHL taking it seriously.\nChara Hit to be Investigated by Police\nVia a story at CBCSports, Radio-Canada has reported that “Quebec’s director of criminal and penal prosecutions, Louis Dionne, has asked police to begin gathering evidence to help prosecutors determine if charges should be laid against Zdeno Chara”. The result of the hit was a terrible misfortune, but this is getting ridiculous.\nMax Pacioretty spoke to TSN’s Bob McKenzie regarding the NHL’s lack of discipline on Zdeno Chara. Via Habs Inside/Out:\n“I am upset and disgusted that the league didn’t think enough of (the hit) to suspend him,” Pacioretty told TSN. “I’m not mad for myself, I’m mad because if other players see a hit like that and think it’s okay, they won’t be suspended, then other players will get hurt like I got hurt.\n“It’s been an emotional day. I saw the video for the first time this morning. You see the hit, I’ve got a fractured vertebrae, I’m in hospital and I thought the league would do something, a little something,” said Pacioretty. “I’m not talking a big number, I don’t know, one game, two games, three games…whatever, but something to show that it’s not right.\n“I heard (Chara) said he didn’t mean to do it. I felt he did mean to do it. I would feel better if he said he made a mistake and that he was sorry for doing that, I could forgive that, but I guess he’s talking about how I jumped up or something.”\nThis is Not a Zdeno Chara/Max Pacioretty Story\nMartin St. Louis scored a beauty of a shootout winner, but was it legal?\nPens Extend Bylsma\nIf you’ve developed a non-sexual man crush on Dan Bylsma since viewing 24/7: Penguins/Capitals, you’re not alone.

{"text": "When it comes to reviews, there’s no right or wrong, as I’ve often said here before, though it doesn’t stop me wondering what kind of madness is about when I disagree so vehemently with some of my colleagues, as happened this summer over The Female of The Species and Zorro. Who was out-of-step with the prevailing wind, them or me?\nBut what’s good is that there is a broad spectrum of opinion being expressed - and there are, at least at the moment, still a wide number of press platforms available in which that can happen. And indeed, some of these are now expanding: once critics would have their last word in their reviews; now, these are just the springboard for challenges elsewhere, and critics are fighting back, with a ferocious new dialogue taking place with readers, practitioners and even each other in the blogosphere.\nI know I’ve been party to this on this blog myself - but now the battles are going even more public.\nMichael Billington gave David Hare’s new play Gethsemane at the National an admiring four-star review; this led to the Daily Telegraph’s Dominic Cavendish issuing a lengthy reply to Billington’s suggestion that the big question that the play throws down, “What is a Labour government for, if it doesn’t carry within its portfolio a map of Utopia?”, in which he says, “But to many of us, idealism has been precisely the problem”; and then Billington, in turn, replied in a blog of his own, that went to great lengths to dissect each of Cavendish’s arguments, including one that “that political theatre has lately been ‘ineffectual as a podium for oppositional thought’”.\nBut whatever the state of play, the reviews about the play have clearly created a dialogue for oppositional opinions - and have intriguingly ranged from the five-star (Michael Coveney on Whatsonstage.com) all the way down to one-star (Christopher Hart in the Sunday Times).\nA similar dialogue has erupted around the issue of the current state of children’s theatre, with the Guardian’s Lyn Gardner taking issue in a blog about Dominic Cavendish’s Telegraph review of the Unicorn’s recent production of Red Fortress, in which Dominic declared, “Once upon a time children’s theatre was all about flying carpets and feats of wonder - now it seems to be about bringing kids down to earth with a disenchanted bump.”\nFor Lyn, however, “Theatres are so worried about upsetting parents and the media that they operate within a straitjacket of self-censorship,” and, she goes on, “As a result, we are shortchanging our children by offering what is - with a few brave exceptions - a diet of theatre (often adapted from bestselling books) that is indeed mostly ‘about flying carpets and feats of wonder’. In doing so, we are giving them a distorted view of reality and theatre. The parental instinct to protect children is a natural one, but just as we must not be ruled by fear and must let our children go out on their own and make their own decisions, so should we let them go into that safest of arenas - the theatre - and confront the issues that they have to face in the real world.”\nThe battle hasn’t stopped there - now Dominic has, in turn, replied in another Telegraph blog, “What immediately riled me was the casual insinuation that if children’s theatre is insufficiently challenging that’s partly down to parental conservatism…. Whether or not you think it’s the role of theatre to confront kids with what many of them already have to grapple with on a daily basis - instead of offering entertainment and even escapism - those remarks seem to come perilously close to saying: if children’s theatre ain’t good enough, that’s your fault, folks. I’d hate to lecture parents like that….”\nDominic, it turns out, was one of the few critics to rave about last week’s opening of Treasure Island, too, giving it a generous four-star notice (against several one-star reviews, including my own in yesterday’s Sunday Express as well as the one I also did for the London Paper, and Georgina Brown in the Mail on Sunday), for which he makes an interesting defence in his blog entry, too: “Reviewing children’s theatre is - surprising to some as this may be - one of the trickiest aspects of the job. Even though I’ve got young kids myself, and have developed a fairly shrewd idea as to what I think would enthuse and excite them (it’s not rocket-science, it usually involves a dynamic, clear, and boldly imaginative kind of storytelling), I can get caught out. Sometimes children will appear bored during shows they emerge raving about - sometimes they seem enthralled only to reveal themselves later as wholly bemused. I had a big hunch watching Treasure Island the other night at the Theatre Royal Haymarket that my seven-year-old son would respond in delight to its rambunctious spirit; in this my four-star verdict diverged sharply from that of critics on other papers who, one notes, don’t have kids in the targeted age-range.”\nWhile Christopher Hart in yesterday’s Sunday Times was accompanied by 11-year-old Sacha whom he duly quoted from in his review, it’s unfair to dismiss other critics for failing to have children in the targeted age-range (if that’s indeed the target of this piece, which has diligently never specified one), as if they cannot therefore judge it appropriately. We are asked all the time to see things outside of our immediate experience - the job would be undoable if we were expected to have a personal connection to everything we see - but in fact Georgina Brown, who does have two teenage children, might have had one, and yet she, too, didn’t like it at all.\nYet, even when a show like Imagine This mostly create a wave of critical consensus about how well-meaning but misjudged it is, you can always count on one or two critics to diverge from the path; and - as well as someone on the freesheet London Lite who gave it four stars - we also yesterday had Tim Walker, who has previously suggested that it’s inhumane to send critics to musicals at all, humanely finding plenty to admire, even “adore” as he put it, in his four-star notice.\nAnd then there’s the artist’s own response: after the recent mostly negative notices for Rupert Goold’s new production of King Lear in Liverpool, Pete Postlethwaite - who played the title role - responded on Radio 4’s Front Row last week by agreeing that they were justified.\nIn a report on the BBC website, he admits, “We were overwhelmed, I think, by the ideas. I think what suffered was the performances.” And since the opening, several elements have now been “jettisoned”, he said. “Things have gone that we found unhelpful, distracting, not true to the story… Rupert’s been bold enough to say, ‘Right, that didn’t work.’…. “Let’s face it, it wasn’t all bad, there was a lot of really good stuff going on, bubbling underneath that just needed releasing.”\nAnd the reviews, no doubt, have played their part in releasing it, and the production from some of its reported excesses.

{"text": "By Joseph Walker\nYou’ve heard about things going on your permanent record? Steve Jobs had one, too.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday made public a background check on the Apple co-founder. The agency assembled the investigation in 1991 because Mr. Jobs was being considered for a presidential appointment by George H.W. Bush to the President’s Export Council, which advises on international trade. Mr. Jobs was appointed to the position that year.\nThe Wall Street Journal/FINS.com requested the file through the Freedom of Information Act. (See the original post on sister site FINS.com.)\nIn the 191-page document, friends and associates describe him as profoundly talented, creative and hardworking. But his many faults are also acknowledged including the fact that he neglected his daughter for the first several years of his life and that his management techniques were considered by many to be abusive.\nTwo individuals, who were acquainted with Mr. Jobs, said he was “strong willed, stubborn, hardworking and driven, which they believe is why he is so successful.”\nAnother source said she was reluctant to discuss Mr. Jobs, because she had “questions concerning his ethics and morality.” The woman, who said that she and Jobs had “experimented” with drugs together in the past, also described him as “shallow and callous.” His success as head of Apple, she said, had given him an “enormous amount of power” and “caused him to distort the truth at times to get his way.” Despite this, she recommended him for the government position.\nA Palo Alto, Calif.-based man who identifies himself as a former “good friend” of Mr. Jobs said that while he was “basically an honest and trustworthy person, he is a very complex individual and his moral character is suspect.” Mr. Jobs “alienated a large number of people at Apple, as a result of his ambition.”\nThe question of whether Mr. Jobs, who had admitted to drug use in his youth, still used drugs while at Apple comes up frequently in the file. It appears nearly everyone interviewed believed he no longer used drugs.\nAn interview subject from International Business Machines said that he never “witnessed any illegal drug usage or alcohol abuse by the appointee” and said Mr. Jobs “seemingly lives within his financial means and he never witnessed any examples of an extravagant lifestyle having been practiced by Jobs.”\nAn unnamed female source said Mr. Jobs “drank only a little wine and did not use any kind of illegal drugs.” However, “in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mr. Jobs may have experimented with illegal drugs, having come from that generation,” the report says.\nOther aspects of the Steve Jobs narrative are referenced in the file, including his pilgrimage to India and his resulting interest in Eastern religion. One person whose name is redacted says that Mr. Jobs “had undergone a change in philosophy by participating in eastern and/or Indian mysticism and religion. This change apparently influenced the Appointee’s personal life for the better.”\nThe person suggests that Mr. Jobs’ apathy toward money and material possessions were manifest in the early 1990s when the investigation was conducted. Mr. Jobs lived a “spartanlike and at times even monastic existence,” the person told investigators.\nJoseph Walker is a reporter for FINS.com, The Wall Street Journal’s jobs and career website.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a74a6ac4-8b9d-4588-bda4-7c9a4b92d372>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/02/09/what-the-fbi-had-on-steve-jobs/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:25:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9856835603713989, "token_count": 755, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "By Brian Aguilar\nThe Wall Street Journal has followed the career of actor Daniel Radcliffe since he skyrocketed to stardom at the age of 12 with the first installment of the Harry Potter series, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” (2001). Since then, J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter franchise has pulled in more than $2 billion at the box office and grown to fuel a $15 billion industry. Radcliffe is now 21 years old.\nWith the final film of the series set to premiere in London on Thursday and hit theaters in the U.S. on July 15, we thought it would be worth a look back on how Harry – er, Daniel – has come of age over the years.\nWe went deep into our Hedcut Archive – our internal database of those iconic stipple portraits that appear in the Journal every day – and pulled out these drawings, all created by long-time Journal artist, Randy Glass, and dating from 2001 to 2007.\nThe first five hedcuts featured here were commissioned for the print edition of the Journal to appear alongside Joe Morgenstern’s film reviews. Alas, the fourth drawing shown didn’t make the cut in the end. Randy tells us Joaquin Phoenix got the nod instead leading this review on “Walk the Line” that accompanied a review of “Goblet of Fire”.\nThe sixth portrait in the set was drawn separately by Randy shortly after “Half-Blood Prince” appeared in theaters.\nNow that the film series is coming to its dramatic conclusion, we decided to have Radcliffe immortalized in dots one last time. Here’s our latest work by artist Bonnie Gayle Morrill:\nWith all of these portraits together for the first time, we can see how Radcliffe’s character has grown up over the years, from being a precocious youth to a determined young man. We can also gauge how much darker the series has become over time.\nYet all of these dots make us wonder: When will we see Radcliffe stippled next?\nCORRECTION: Earlier, we stated that the fifth drawing in the set above didn’t appear in print. It was actually the fourth portrait that never made the cut. The story has been updated.\n- “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” (11/16/2001)\n- “Chamber of Secrets” (11/15/02)\n- “Prisoner of Azkaban” (6/4/04)\n- “Goblet of Fire” (11/18/05) *A hedcut portrait was commissioned for this review but it never ran in print.\n- “Order of the Phoenix” (7/13/07)\nFor reference, here are the dates and movie reviews where the first set of drawings appeared in the Journal’s print edition:\nFollow us on Twitter at @WSJSpeakeasy", "id": "<urn:uuid:46cdba27-9739-40fe-8a5f-6ed76c54abce>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/07/06/harry-potter-comes-of-age-one-hedcut-at-a-time/?mod=e2tw", "date": "2013-05-18T05:25:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9464026093482971, "token_count": 627, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "From the rich, neutral colors to authentic Maasai beadwork, it’s clear to see why we love the Pikolinos summer sandal collection! The earthy, wearable designs are completely on point with this season’s tribal and boho-inspired trends. Wear these lovely sandals with everything from maxi dresses to shorts for the ultimate combo of great style and comfort. Who says you can’t have it all?\nZappos Blogs: neutral sandals\nThis week’s Stylists' Picks revolve around the wonderful versatility of the strappy flat sandal. In this case, it’s the lovely Lucky Brand Caryl that gets the fashion spotlight. Getting the most mileage out of a pair of sandals is exponentially more important when packing for that summer vacation. Here, we've put together four distinct looks that all revolve around this must-have warm-weather basic.\nThe flowy and lightweight Brigitte Bailey Flamenco Dress harmoniously works with the Lucky Brand Caryl sandals’ effortless and laid-back style. This flirty ensemble would be perfect for attending a daytime beach wedding or strolling along a fabulous tropical resort. Paired with the stunning tribal-inspired BCBGeneration Aztec clutch and earthy Lucky Brand Ranch Inn turquoise necklace, this look really says “summer goddess” with very minimal effort on your part.\nFor a more low-key, dressed-down look, pair the Caryl sandals with the sweet Lucky Brand Georgia Pintuck Tank Top and laid-back and on-trend 7 For All Mankind Josephina Mid Roll-Up Shorts. This ensemble is particularly appropriate to wear to the beach or the boardwalk. A nautical-inspired bag, like the MICHAEL Michael Kors Marina Large Shoulder Tote in the bright and playful Sun color, makes this breezy look really pop. Of course, don’t forget to protect your locks and your face with a woven fedora like this one by Laundry by Shelly Segal that our stylists handpicked.\nThe next look paired with the Caryl sandal happens to be a picture-perfect daytime date ensemble. The fresh coral and brown palette on the Kenneth Cole New York Tiered Tank goes perfectly with the crisp white on the Paige Premium Denim Roxbury Crop jeans. This soft, feminine look is topped off with a nice dose of turquoise accents in the B.Makowsky Isabel Handheld Satchel and Lucky Brand Wild Flowers Drop Earrings.\nShowcasing the flat sandal’s utter versatility, the last ensemble is a dressier look that still works seamlessly. The gorgeous BCBGeneration printed dress is perfect for both day and night. Pulling from the soft rose tones on the dress, the ALDO Zembower clutch, in the prettiest shade of pink, really sweetens up this girly outfit.\n© 2007-2012 Zappos.com, Inc.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9dea0e17-9dc6-46e1-9f63-85af16dbe0ee>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.zappos.com/taxonomy/term/20192", "date": "2013-05-18T06:51:05Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8754068613052368, "token_count": 620, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

I wanted to have an organic sound, bigger and thicker, so I went out and bought some 1970′s Kustom tuck ‘n roll bass amps to play some of the guitar parts through. You’ll hear real reverb, real tremolo on this album, which sounds completely different than the stuff that’s done with computer chips.”\nThere are definitely a few stand out tracks that will appeal to classic Danzig fans including Juju Bone, Rebel Spirits, and Night Star Hell.

{"text": "The release of Ben Affleck’s smart historical satire Argo, based loosely on the true extraction by the CIA and Canadian officials of six American Embassy staff members out of Tehran in 1980, made me reflect on the spy genre as a whole. The penumbral world of international double and triple agents, where there’s a poison-tipped umbrella in every cafe and a micro-dotted envelope in every office, is often the stuff of great movies. As a genre it peaked in the 1960s thanks to the exploits of superspy James Bond and the more down-to-earth escapades created by Adam Hall, Len Deighton and John le Carré. Despite the end of the Cold War the spy genre has flourished but changed to keep up with the shifts in the political landscape post 9/11.\nSo here, submitted for Todd Mason’s Overlooked Movies meme over at his Sweet Freedom blog, is my list of favourites, and the reasons why, in chronological order, focusing mostly on the Cold War period …\nDick Gordon: National Security Agency.\nMartin Bishop: Ah. You’re the guys I hear breathing on the other end of my phone.\nDick Gordon: No, that’s the FBI. We’re not chartered for domestic surveillance.\nMartin Bishop: Oh, I see. You just overthrow governments. Set up friendly dictators.\nDick Gordon: No, that’s the CIA. We protect our government’s communications, we try to break the other fella’s codes. We’re the good guys, Marty.\nMartin Bishop: Gee, I can’t tell you what a relief that is… Dick.\n- dialogue from SNEAKERS (1992)\nI love spy stories, topical and historical, whether at the cinema or on TV, radio and in print for their unrivalled ability in the mystery genre to reflect the existential malaise of their times and just for the sheer possibilities for excitement, atmosphere and surprise in the plots. The genre has attracted many serious writers (from Conrad to Greene to Banville to Pynchon) and many of my choices below are adaptations derived from previously published works. I have included three films by Hitchcock, which is a lot, but they all seem sufficiently different to merit inclusion (he made a great many spy thrillers) but it does mean that I have not included some quirky titles just because I ran out of space.\nIn putting my selection together I have tried to be fairly narrow to try and keep the list contained. So for instance I have avoided titles that include surveillance but that do not involve espionage in the traditional sense of government agents and so on, thus excluding the wonderful The Conversation (1974) for instance and also the Oscar-winning The Lives of Others (2006), which although more clearly in the Cold War mould, is not really thought of as a spy movie – well, at least not by me … I have also excluded parodies and spoofs, though I do enjoy them – so you will look in vain here for films featuring Matt Helm, Derek Flint, Charles Vine, the Carry On team etc. The Man from UNCLE has been excluded for that reason but also because the cinema releases it generated were just TV episodes re-packaged and I plan on doing a top 20 TV list of my favourite spy shows soon.\n1. THE 39 STEPS (1935)\nThe Hitchcock version, adapted in collaboration with writer Charles Bennett, was merely the first of several takes on the John Buchan novel and far from being the most faithful. But it pretty much set up the template for the director’s celebrated innocent man on the run movies (see North By Northwest below for the US equivalent) and is full of humour and surprise. The unmasking of the villain, who has only been described by his missing half finger, is a classic moment of movie cinema and the sequence with the protagonists handcuffed together is a classic all its own, combining Hitch’s trademark erotic perversity with black humour. Copied endlessly, never truly equalled. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n2. CONTRABAND (1940)\nAfter the success of The Spy in Black the year before, the new writer-director team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger made another spy movie starring Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson and in typical fashion, the hero is a German! The two make a smashing pair as they travel through London to stop a group of Nazis loose on British soil one night during the blackout (which is why it was released in the US as ‘Blackout’), trading barbed witticisms as they go. Available on DVD under its US title.\n3. FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO (1943)\nBilly Wilder combines wartime news grabbed from the headlines (Rommel in the desert) to craft a superb tale of espionage, derring-do and hidden treasure. Erich Von Stroheim is Rommel, top-billed Franchot Tone is passable as a British soldier masquerading as a club-footed waiter and Anne Baxter is the plucky and self-sacrificing waitress. Overlooked in comparison with the writer-director’s later and better-known classics, this one is particularly unjustly neglected in my view for its well-drawn characters and well-crafted plot. Available on DVD.\n4. MASK OF DIMITRIOS (1944)\nThis adaptation of the classic Eric Ambler novel, sadly AWOL on DVD at present, offers a stunning rogue’s gallery of character actors (including Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet) and is meticulously structured as a series of interlocking flashbacks, all handled with great style by debut director Jean Negulesco. Ambler after Maugham and more or less concurrent with Graham Greene probably did more than anyone to make the spy genre respectable in literary circles and also to make it topical and realistic. But he also told some great stories. Orson Welles’ production of Journey Into Fear from Ambler’s book is sadly chaotic in the version that was released by RKO but almost made this list none the less – at least you can get that one on DVD without trying too hard …\n5. NOTORIOUS (1946)\nOne of Hitchcock’s finest movies, with Cary Grant as the CIA controller falling in love with his agent Ingrid Bergman, who has gone undercover to find out what Claude Rains and other neo-Nazis are up to in South America. A sexy and suspenseful picture, its plot was shamelessly stolen without credit for Mission impossible 2. The original is infinitely preferable and also has one of the director’s best MacGuffins too. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n6. THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS (1956)\n‘Operation Mincemeat’ really happened and this film, scripted by Nigel Balchin, is comparatively faithful to the facts as they were known at the time. It was an attempt by the Allies to fool the Nazis into believing that they were not going to invade Sicily in 1943 but land in Greece and Sardinia instead. Clifton Webb gives a highly restrained performance as the intelligence officer who comes up with the ghoulish plan of dropping a recently dead body with fake documentation int he hope that the Nazis will pick it up. Stephen Boyd is the Irish agent who comes to London to check the story which provides plenty of irony and excitement (and is the part fo the script that is the most clearly fictional). A fascinating true story now available on DVD and Blu-ray too (in the UK).\n7. NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959)\nClever script concocted by Ernest Lehman – the hunt for a spy in which as executive Cary Grant gets mistaken for a spy, who doesn’t exists – great set-pieces (the crop duster sequence, the chase across Mount Rushmore, the assassination at the UN), a wonderful music score by Bernard Herrmann and a great henchman in Martin Landau – its wonderful stuff. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n8. THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962)\nAdapted from the book by Richard Condon, this story of brainwashing and political assassination is a true cinema classic. Angela Lansbury plays the scariest screen mother ever and director John Frankenheimer was never better – a cruel, nightmarish movie with a wicked satirical edge. Simply one of the best films ever made – not to be confused with the disappointing remake starring Denzel Washington. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n9. FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE (1963)\nNot my favourite Bond movie but probably the best plotted of the early films and the most successful in terms of combining action, intrigue and espionage. Len Deighton worked on an early draft of the script and John Barry provides a pounding score while the fabulous supporting cast includes Lotte Lenya, Pedro Armendariz and Robert Shaw. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n10. THE IPCRESS FILE (1965)\nLen Deighton combined the private eye hardboiled style with the modern spy story with brilliant results – the movie, wonderfully scored by John Barry and directed in a fussy, febrile and dynamic Film Noir fashion by Sidney J. Furie, changed the book quite a bit but Michael Caine is brilliant as the protagonist (here named ‘Harry Palmer’) and this may be the greatest of all 60s spy movies for its clever story, brilliant acting and high style. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n11. THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD (1965)\nThe le Carré anti-Bond par-excellence, shot in contrasty black and white, this has enough twists for two movies but is anchored in a quartet of excellent performances led by Richard Burton as the disillusioned protagonist, Oskar Werner as his cold opposite number, Cyril Cusack as the devious head of British Intelligence and Claire Bloom as the innocent caught in between. Unforgettable. Available on DVD.\n12. THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM (1966)\nAn almost fairy tale atmosphere permeates this classic story of neo-Nazis in 1960s Berlin. George Segal is much too young as Quiller but is otherwise very good in the role and Max von Sydow is, as always, a fine villain (he even got to play Blofeld once). Senta Berger is the gorgeous damsel in distress and the memorable score is by John Barry, who truly provided the soundtrack to 1960s espionage cinema. I reviewed the film separately here. Available on DVD.\n13. WHERE EAGLES DARE (1968)\nWar movie-cum-spy thriller in this men on a mission movie written by Alistair MacLean and starring Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood and the late Ingrid Pitt. Utterly preposterous and remembered mainly for its huge action scenes, it also has a wonderfully convoluted spy plot in the middle and has a nice twist at the end too – and a classic score by Ron Goodwin – what’s not to like? Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n14. THE THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR (1975)\nThis low-key piece of espionage, a kind of 39 Steps (see above) brought up to date, inadvertently caught the post-Watergate zeitgeist with its cynical view of government and the intelligence community. Redford is the low level CIA operative on the run from he known not whom, Faye Dunaway the girl he meets and Max von Sydow the cool killer for hire. Meticulously directed by the late Sidney Pollack, this is a thriller that still works extremely well, its central distrust of large organisations continuing to chime with the times … Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n15. NO WAY OUT (1987)\nThis very clever adaptation of Kenneth Fearing’s The Big Clock is relocated to the Pentagon with Kevin Costner set to unmask a mole by murderous politician Gene Hackman. Highly suspenseful and with a humdinger of a final twist. I previously reviewed the film here. Available on DVD.\n16. THE RUSSIA HOUSE (1991)\nAdapted by Tom Stoppard from the novel by John le Carre, this is one of the last, great Cold War thrillers made just as the East-West thaw was settling. The supporting cast is wonderfully – especially Roy Scheider as the scabrous CIA chief, along with the likes of JT Walsh, John Mahoney, James Fox, Michael Kitchen and the great Klaus Maria Brandauer, all serving the unlikely but ultimately winning star team of Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer. Shot on location in Moscow this film also has a wonderful music score by Jerry Goldsmith, played by Branford Marsalis. Available on DVD and Blu-ray (in France at least).\n17. SNEAKERS (1992)\nBranford Marsalis is also the soloist for this film (scored by James Horner), which was originally designed as a sequel to the 1983 Matthew Broderick cyber thriller Wargames. What ultimately emerged however was perhaps more caper movie than espionage, a film that affects a light tone but knows how to interject real jeopardy at the halfway mark to up the stakes in the search for the ultimate secret encryption decoding machine. Beautifully played by a great cast of new and old faces, with Redford and Poitier holding up the rear while the likes of River Phoenix and Dan Aykroyd steal all the scenes, which delight in building one paradox after another (a blind man drives a getaway car, a theft has to undertaken as slowly as possibly, an empty box that proves to have all the answers and so on). Really worth rediscovering. Available on DVD.\n18. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996)\nI love Brian De Palma and his take on the 1960s and 70s TV series was typically subversive, wiping out the team in the opening sequence and turning heroes into outcasts. Of the four Tom Cruise movies made in this series (so far) this is the only one that really stands up as a spy movie. Along with the celebrated Langley break-in (with Cruise hanging on wires) there are spectacular and small bits of business that prove endlessly intriguing, such as the revelation of the second IMF team at the restaurant and the sequences in which one character relates how he escaped death and the visualisation by the hero in his mind that directly contradicts it – all much cleverer than your average Summer movie. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n19. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004)\nHaving found the original underwhelming, this sequel was much more impressive with director Paul Greengrass’ kinetic style immediately impressing to create a truly breathless story of cross and double cross and Bourne tries to outwit various intelligence agencies and discover his real identity. Only the exit of the leading lady seems misjudged – for me the best of the Bourne series, by far. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n20. TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY (2011)\nA movie that stands on its own without ignoring both its literary origins in the le Carré novel and the 1979 BBC TV mini-series starring Alec Guinness as spymaster George Smiley. Most of the people I know who claim to have not been able to follow this movie properly were those that did not know the story from previous incarnations, and I can see how the final revelation of the mole in British intelligence is perhaps a little bit too oblique – and the final death a bit too convenient-seeming (unless you’re read the book, where it is made clear that the parties in question had a pre-arranged rendezvous). This may be considered a bit of a failing from a story-telling standpoint and the subplot involving Tom hardy’s Ricky Tarr is perhaps made too prominent at the expense of clarity. Additionally one could argue that Oldman is perhaps too beholden at times to Alec Guinness’ TV portrayal but this movie has virtues all its own, especially in its masterly use of flashback. And the 70s atmosphere is brilliantly caught, the final use of a Julio Iglesias recording brilliantly judged in my view. Available on DVD and Blu-ray.\nWith the exception of the Bourne film I have deliberately excluded the many, many films dealing with international terrorism since the World Trade Center Attack, purely for reasons of space. This means that really fine films like David Mamet’s Spartan (2004) have been omitted though it is well worth looking for. The same goes for Traitor (2008), a fascinating little movie starring Don Cheadle based on a story by comedian Steve Martin, though the best of them so far may well be Syriana (2005) starring George Clooney.

{"text": "Business Functions and Processes in Extended Mass Layoffs in the Third Quarter 2012\nEmployers initiated 885 extended mass layoff events in the third quarter of 2012 that resulted in the separation of 138,484 workers from their jobs for at least 31 days, according to preliminary figures released by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. Extended mass layoff events related to nonseasonal economic reasons totaled 706 and involved the separation of 112,193 workers. More complete information on third quarter 2012 extended mass layoffs can be obtained from the news release\nThe total number of business functions reported by employers in nonseasonal layoff events in the third quarter was 1,373, a decrease from 1,872 business functions a year earlier.

{"text": "Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz, Anxiety Veiled: Euripides and the Traffic in Women. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993. Pp. 246. $14.95 (pb). ISBN-0-8014-8091-4.\nReviewed by Jennifer Dellner, Reed College.\nSorkin Rabinowitz presents a provocative and ultimately unsettling analysis of the phenomenon of \"the traffic in women\" in eight tragedies of Euripides. The phrase \"traffic in women\" in the subtitle of the book derives from an article written in 1975 by Gayle Rubin, which has since become the locus classicus of feminist literary and anthropological theory of women and exchange. The prominence of Rubin highlights other theoretical choices and exclusions which reveal a deeper agenda.1 In the conclusion of this study, S.R. recounts the following incident: \"When I presented my work at a conference several years ago, someone in the audience asked me why we should continue to teach and read this material. I admit that this is a problem for me, given the competition for scarce resources in the curriculum, for example.\" S.R. continues, \"It is possible for feminist readers to use these texts...\" (220).\nHer own ambiguity vis-à-vis the value of her subject matter produces what I consider to be the book's most dominant flaw: the assumption of the monolithic feminist \"we\" in a premise of despair over what tragedy means to \"us\" (women). Indeed, in her Introduction, S.R. speaks of adapting Althusser for \"deployment in the feminist arsenal\" (12), while I am left wondering why I need weaponry to approach these texts. S.R.'s assumptions are \"up-front,\" in that they are explained at the outset and embedded in her interpretation. In what follows, I have noted several theoretical moves which may make even a feminist reader uneasy; since they often account for S.R.'s acceptance or rejection of a certain understanding of the tragedies, I present them as I move through the text.\nIn spite of an introductory section which traces out a by now well-known route from Mauss to Gernet to Levi-Strauss to Rubin on the exchange of gifts, women, and signs, S.R.'s analysis is more Freudian than Marxist, and it is this approach which will generate the most controversy. Her segue from Marxism to Freudian psychoanalysis relies on their shared vocabulary of \"the fetish.\" Fetishism ties together the economy of (masculine) desire (Freud), and the social construction of commodities (Marx), and allows S.R. to \"attend to the maculinity of Athens and stress tragedy's ideological function\" (9), i.e. to examine the \"cultural work\" tragedy does when it makes its female characters \"discursive practices\" (12) in its form(ul)ation of masculine desire qua Athenian ideology. S.R.'s examination of the cultural practice of Euripidean tragedy comes to a view of tragedy as \"comforting to men\" (168), a far cry from recent views of tragedy as a destabilizing or questioning influence on Athenian life and politics (e.g. Goldhill's term, \"fractive\").2\nAll in all, S.R.'s reading yields the following triangle: the two species of commodified women are \"Fetishized Victims,\" (Part I), who are either \"sacrificial\" virgins or wives, and \"Vengeful Destoyers\" (Part II), Matres Dolorosae, who become, in opposition to their fetishized counterparts, unheimlich or \"uncanny\"; both of these serve to produce \"Men United\" (Part III). S.R.'s reliance on the Freudian concept of the unheimlich to balance vengeful mothers with fetishized young women clearly inclines her analysis toward a psychoanalytic theory of male wish-fulfillment. S.R. makes good use of Freudian-based feminist film criticism (Doane, deLauretis, Mulvey) in her reading of female characters as projections of male fantasy. It is in this concept of \"public art\" that S.R. uses MacKinnon's work on ideology to relate the notions of male sexual desire and commodified fantasy to the production of epistemology (196).\nIphigenia (at Aulis) and Alcestis are S.R.'s main models for the \"sacrificial\" women of Part I, though an examination of Polyxena and Macaria supports S.R.'s reading of Iphigenia in the first chapter. In the first section, S.R. opposes the supposed \"subject\" status of women who sacrifice their lives (their seeming volition and possible power) with the male glorification (\"fetishization\") of them which seeks to control it. In this section, S.R. wishes to produce a \"grammar of the plays of sacrifice,\" where she argues that sacrifice is a form of gift-exchange with the gods (31). She turns to work by Vernant and Foley to make a further analogy between sacrifice and marriage as comparable forms of exchange. Both marriage and sacrifice, according to S.R., re-organize \"natural\" phenomena (reproduction, meat-eating) into social, hierarchized behaviors which advantage the male: \"In sum,\" she writes, \"marriage is like sacrifice because in marriage woman is the offering through which culture is constituted\" (34).\nIphigenia, Polyxena, and Makaria are marked by their \"oscillation\" between states as volunteering subjects and idolized objects. S.R. has apparently borrowed the term \"oscillation\" from Doane, and uses it five times in Part I -- pages 54,71, 83, 98, 99 -- to mark the sense of movement between the women's gestures at subjectivity/power, which marks them as \"uncanny,\" and their only act as subjects (submission), which leads to their glorification and maintains the masculine-dominant status-quo. Fetishism, according to S.R., \"oscillates between mutilation and adoration\" (83), an explanation which has little to do with Marxist theory, and much more to do with Sorkin-Rabinowitz's use of \"castration anxiety\" to explain the attempts of Athenian males to control their potentially threatening women.\nHerein lies a tension in S.R.'s analysis between the universalizing tendencies of Freudian criticism and her attempt to formulate a specifically Athenian male ideology. S.R.'s reliance on psychoanalytic explanation often feels superfluous in the face of her acute and perceptive readings of the plays themselves, and many notions of what is specifically Athenian in the plays is obscured by her discussion of what is male/Euripidean. For example, it is not clear, in her final and excellent analysis of Kreousa in the Ion, whether any male could have written a different play:Psychoanalytic theory speculates that the infant, denied the milk of the mother (either because he is biting and hurting her or because another child has come along to take his place), responds with aggressive fantasies of destroying her but justifies his own hostility by imagining that she is harming him. Euripides, taking the part of the son, creates a scenario in which the mother does harm to the infant first. Euripides justifies Ion's attack on Kreousa by depicting her as an aggressor. (202-203)Her analysis of the Ion and the Hippolytus in Part III argues for this scenario (or primal scene) as the governing fantasy of all the Euripidean tragedies under consideration. The idolized women are merely the solution to the \"Vengeful Destroyers\" (Hekabe, Alcmene, Medea and Phaidra) whom she discusses in Part II. Unable to re-incorporate the power of older powerful women under the rubric of fetished glory/virtue, Euripidean tragedy manages their potential threat by pairing them off with their younger, sacrificial counterparts, demonstrating that these older women are indeed destructive of the social order. As she writes of Hekabe, \"In the beginning, she is associated with the human realm as it faces the unheimlich, but by the end she is instead viewed as a manifestation of the uncanny itself\" (116). S.R. views this association as purely recuperative on the part of Athenian males, but with implications which \"can be positive\" (105) for \"us.\" Athenian men \"displace\" their anxieties \"aroused by and on behalf of masculine civilization onto the female\" by making the female cede to the male spatially in the plots' narratives (Hekabe, Hippolytus), and in general by using displacement to deflect \"audience attention from systemic failings to [the women's] violence\" (108). These women become a \"screen\" for the projection of masculine anxieties about their own (male) violence. However, \"we\" \"can look for [positive] traces of female subjectivity, but let us not fool ourselves that Euripides applauds it\" (154).\nS.R. is at her best in this central section, perhaps because, although psychoanalytic film theory lends her the notion of displacement onto the screen of female characters, she lets go of her tendency to use Freud to provide proof of what she finds, and instead performs very acute and nuanced readings of the tragedies which argue well for her findings. In Parts I and III, she seems much more concerned with establishing the plays' cohesion with Freudian paradigms than she is in Part II, where her use of theory backgrounds, and never overshadows, her own interpretive work.\nYet even here, her own findings often make S.R. nervous, and prevent her from drawing certain conclusions, as she attempts to quash any heroizing emotional response the women's strength produces in her by retreating to a contemporary moral agenda. She says of Medea's solution to her problems: \"Given the realities of child abuse in our own time, however, I find it problematic to simply applaud Medea's infanticide and escape\" (154). S.R.'s objections make plain what some feel to be a difficulty of reading as a feminist theorist: the notion that to be a feminist, one must find something positive in these women, must be able to identify with their strength and their choices. Because S.R. finds such choices (whether submission or murder) to be morally unacceptable, she cannot accept that a real woman would make these choices; only a construct in a collective male fantasy would: \"the murder of the children is his [Euripides'] choice, not Medea's\" (153). Her uneasiness denies the fact that women have chosen to kill and been heroized for it (Bonnie and Clyde, for example, evoke similar emotions in some, as do Thelma and Louise).\nGranted the presence of difficulties such as these, S.R.'s analyses of the final two plays (the Hippolytus again from the Father-Son vantage point, and the Ion) with the \"arsenal\" fully deployed -- all terms operational -- are well worth foregoing one's qualms. Although it may be jarring for a classicist of the non-Freudian persuasion to encounter the phrase, \"The pre-Oedipal phase of Ion's life\" (193), a reliance on Freudian scenarios is nicely counterbalanced in Part III by S.R.'s articulation of what may be a historically specific psychology of the influence of repressed homoerotic desire between Athenian men. She states as a general principle that \"The possibility or probability of an erotic charge between father and son was denied in antiquity because that relationship founded the social order. Horizontal desire for one like oneself is the repressed, unconscious desire of this text [Hippolytus]; it is gratified by being transformed into a vertical (asexual) desire of father for son\" (174). This dynamic of desire is demonstrated in the Ion as well, and it is in S.R.'s smart and well-supported readings of the texts themselves that readers will find well-founded provocation toward more exploration and research.\nS.R. has undertaken some risks by exposing, in our own terms, the psychic and moral dilemmas which may underlie the tragedies' exposition of the so many powerful, brave, and troubling women who are at the core of Athenian thought as we know it. Instead of arguing that the Greeks existed in a realm \"Before Sexuality,\" Sorkin-Rabinowitz concludes that the insurgent power of women arises from a strong, historically situated, pre-Oedipal drive (220-221), of which Athenian men were only too aware, and had to constantly attempt to manage in a public realm where their most repressed fears could be rendered safe by a particular mechanism of fantasy.\n There are places where recent work on exchange which she has excluded could be used to bolster her argument.

In an interview on WFAN, he said he’s “comfortable” with where the talks stand and added “I feel positive that I’m going to be in New York for a very long time.”\n“I feel comfortable where we’re at,\" Cruz said. “I think I’ve done enough to show them I’m a good guy on and off the field, and that I’ve done everything positive up until this point to prove that I’m somebody that the organization will want to keep around for a long time.\n“So I’m comfortable in that. I’m positive things will come around and a positive outcome will come out of all this.’’\nCruz, who followed up his record-setting 2011 (1,536 receiving yards) with a Pro Bowl season in 2012 (86 catches, 1,092 yards, 10 touchdowns) is due to become a restricted free agent when the signing period opens on March 12. If he doesn’t have a new deal in place by then, the Giants almost certainly will use give him a “first-round” tender offer, which would guarantee him nearly $3 million in 2013.\nThat would also give the Giants the right to match any offer he receives as a restricted free agent, and the right to a first-round pick as compensation from the team that signs him if they don’t match.\nThe two sides would appear to prefer to reach a long-term agreement before then, and talks were opened during the regular season. At one point Cruz said the “structure” of a deal was in place, but clearly there was more work to be done.\n“It got tabled for a couple weeks, mainly because of the two sides agreeing to disagree at the same time,\" Cruz said. \"But now that the season’s over and the statistics are what they are, I think we’re going to get back and pick up the pen again and see what we can do.\" Read more...\nBradshaw Runs Into Doubts\nExcerpt: \"Ahmad Bradshaw says he’ll be “a Giant forever.” But he can’t say for sure that he’ll be in a Giants uniform next season.\nBradshaw rushed for more than 1,000 yards for the second time in his career, and he says he’s entering the offseason in relatively good health. But to hear him talk about it, his reward for that performance could be a dismissal from the only team he’s ever known.\n“You just never know who won’t be back next year,” Bradshaw said as he cleaned out his locker earlier this week. “Including me.”\nThe statement may have seemed odd, especially since Bradshaw has two years remaining on the four-year extension that he signed in the summer of 2011. But the 26-year-old running back clearly doesn’t believe that his role in New York is secure. He spoke the same way immediately after Sunday’s season finale, saying that “this was going to be the last ride for a lot of guys to be Giants” and “it could be me by the same token.” Read more...\nVictor Cruz Expected to Seek $8 - 10 Million Per Season\nExcerpt: \"Victor Cruz has done enough to convince the Giants he deserves to be wearing his No. 80 jersey and doing his salsa in the end zone for a long time. It is going to cost the Giants dearly, though, to get him locked up with a multi-year deal.\nCruz is set to become a restricted free agent and he’s not going anywhere, as the Giants know they cannot operate their offense without his skills at receiver. They would likely tender him on a one-year deal if they cannot agree on a long-term contract.After playing for the NFL minimums the past three years, Cruz won’t come cheap, not after two outstanding seasons by a 26-year-old on the upside of his career. His asking price is expected to be somewhere between $8 million and $10 million per year. Cruz made $540,000 this season and the last two years he has been the greatest bargain in the league.\n“I think I feel comfortable where we’re at,’’ Cruz said yesterday on his weekly WFAN spot. “I think I’ve done enough to show them I’m a good guy on and off the field and I’ve done everything positive up until this point to prove that I’m somebody the organization will want to keep around for a long time. I’m positive things will come around and a positive outcome will come out of all this.’’\nCruz has previously said he wanted a new deal in place before the end of the season and revealed weeks ago that he believed the structure for such a deal was in place. Talks, he reported, “got tabled for a couple weeks mainly because the two sides agreeing to disagree at the same time. Now that the season is over and the statistics are what they are I think we’re gonna get back and pick up the pen again and see what we can do.’’Cruz is one of 22 free agents for the Giants to sort through but he figures to be a top priority. Fellow receiver Hakeem Nicks was slowed all season with foot and ankle issues, allowing opposing defenses to swing the attention to Cruz. Still, he caught 86 passes for 1,092 yards and 10 touchdowns, all team highs. He hasn’t missed a game in two years.\nA year ago, the free agent market produced some hefty salaries for receivers and Cruz will benefit from that spending spree. After all, he compares favorably to DeSean Jackson (five years, $47 million), Robert Meachem (four years, $25.9 million) and Pierre Garcon (five years, $42.5 million). Cruz’ two-year totals (168 catches, 2,628 yards, 19 touchdowns) are better than any two seasons put together by Vincent Jackson and he signed a five year, $55.6 million mega deal with the Buccaneers.\" Read more...\nGiants Hope To Avoid Brownout With Young Safety\nExcerpt: \"Stevie Brown is set to become a restricted free agent and, given the season he just gave the Giants, how can they move forward without re-signing him?\nThe season is over and done with for the Giants, but the hits keep coming for Brown, who yesterday was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week, the first Giants safety to receive that honor twice in a season.Brown, 25, finished up a breakthrough first year with the Giants in style. On the fifth play of last Sunday’s 42-7 victory over the Eagles, Brown intercepted a Michael Vick pass and returned it 48 yards, setting up the Giants’ first touchdown. Brown also had six solo tackles, matching Chase Blackburn for the team lead.\nSigned as primarily a special teams player, Brown started 11 games, as Kenny Phillips was mostly out of the lineup with knee issues. Brown made the most of his playing time, leading the team with eight interceptions, second in the NFL behind Tim Jennings of the Bears, who had nine. The eight interceptions were the most by a Giant since Willie Williams had 10 in 1968. Brown previously played for the Raiders and Colts and in 23 career games did not have any interceptions.\n“Stevie had an outstanding season and became a ball-hawk for us,’’ Antrel Rolle said on WFAN. “It just seemed like he had a magnet for the ball. It was crazy.\n’’What happens next with Brown is probably tied to what the Giants do with Phillips, who after five seasons is an unrestricted free agent and seems headed elsewhere. Asked if he thinks he needs a change of scenery, Phillips laughed and said, “I just got to wait and see what happens.’’ Read more...\nTHE BERGEN RECORD\nNEW YORK TIMES\nWALL STREET JOURNAL\nMaybe they would finally be able to break out of their shell, play with consistency and become perennial title contenders.

It's what makes the NFL go 'round. Every team wants it, not every team has it, and even some who are fortunate enough to acquire it still find a way to fall flat on their face. Talent is one of many words that can be used to describe the 2012 New York Giants, and it is also what gave fans hope heading into the season that this team would be different.\nNone of those \"maybe's\" came to fruition this year. Today, safety Antrel Rolle apologized on behalf of his teammates for the colossal failure that was the 2012 season.\n\"Just want to apologize for a letdown,\" Rolle said on WFAN. \"Unfortunately, we came up a little bit short this year. Something that pretty much caught all of us by surprise.\"\nRolle was the leader of a secondary that ranked 28th in the league in yards given up through the air. It's hard to pin the blame on any one player, because there were breakdowns throughout the entire unit.

But neither side could come to an agreement on an extension.\nCruz finished the season with 86 receptions for 1,092 yards and 10 touchdowns and is heading to the Pro Bowl. He will be a restricted free agent in 2013 but remains positive about a long-term deal.\" Read more...\nEli Says He \"Needed To Play Better\"\nExcerpt: \"Eli Manning had two of the best games he has ever had this season.\nHe set career-highs of 510 yards passing against Tampa Bay and threw for five touchdowns in the season finale against Philadelphia.\nBut overall, 2012 was a bit of a step back for Manning. Coming off his best season ever in 2011, Manning failed to throw for 4,000 yards and 27 touchdowns for the first time since 2008.\n“I don’t think it was as good as it needed to be,” Manning said on his weekly appearance on WFAN radio of his play this past season. “I think there were a couple of games where (I) wasn’t as on and I needed to play better.”\nAs hot as Manning got in the Tampa and Philadelphia wins, he also went ice cold at times.\nHe had a three-game touchdown drought in the middle of the season -– the worst stretch since his rookie season which sparked speculation of a tired arm –- and threw for one touchdown or less in 10 games this season.\nManning admitted that Hakeem Nicks’ knee injury robbed the offense of a lot.\n“Not having Hakeem 100 percent for most of the season really the last 10 weeks can hurt,” Manning said. “He is out there playing hurt and you love that toughness about him.\n“It just made it tough when you are starting a receiver who’s got to win those one-on-one matchups and is your deep threat and playmaker,” Manning continued. “It can be tough to adjust to that and timing was off on a number of things.”\nNot having a consistent third receiving threat also hurt as the Giants struggled to replace Mario Manningham.\nManning said having the stability of the same head coach and offensive coordinator beside him will help in the offseason.\" Read more...\nBIG BLUE VIEW\nGiants 42, Eagles 7: Hits Misses, And Musings\nExcerpt: \"I spent the better part of my ride home from Sunday night’s game trying to think of a fitting analogy to best describe the Giants’ 2012 season.\nI finally settled on a childhood favorite of mine, the fable of The Tortoise and the Hare by Aesop, which, if you’re not familiar, you can read here.Of if you’d rather have the condensed version of the tale, the gist of the story is that the hare, thinking he had all the time in the world to beat the tortoise in a race, decided to slack off only to awaken when it was too late – and to find that the tortoise, whom no one would have even imagined could beat a hare in a footrace, had indeed won.\nSo what does this have to do with the Giants’ 2012 season?\nRepeatedly, we heard the players say after a loss that they weren’t worried, that the season was a marathon and not a sprint.It was almost as though they were shrugging off that, like the hare in the fable, they had perhaps grown fat with their positive press clippings that came with being the defending Super Bowl champions or that perhaps someone would stumble, and all would be right again.\nIt didn’t work out that way, and the Giants, after a disappointing second half of the season that saw two uninspired and forgettable losses to the Falcons and the Ravens, awoke from their slumber to thump the Eagles into oblivion.But it was too late. Gone was having destiny in their hand. And with that, gone was their chance of defending their world title.It’s a harsh lesson, but one that the Giants faithful can only hope that, whichever players are back next year, remembers and passes down to any of the new players who are coming in via free agency or the draft.\nThere are many hits to be handed out despite the Giants failed to get into the playoffs. Here are a few that stick out the most to me.\nThere must be something to playing against the Eagles for linebacker Chase Blackburn, who earlier in the season had one of his best games against Philly and who had yet another good game in the regular season finale. The Giants’ best pass rusher, Blackburn was all over the place, very nearly sacking quarterback Michael Vick., And when he wasn’t harassing Vick, he was limiting the damage LeSean McCoy and Bryce Brown tried to inflict against the Giants run defense.What was particularly impressive with Blackburn is that of his seven tackles, the majority came at or near the line of scrimmage and not seven or more yards down field, as we had seen from others on the defense in previous weeks.\nI don’t know what the future holds for Blackburn, an unrestricted free agent, but he’s definitely one of the most underappreciated linebackers out there.\nOffensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride split the carries between David Wilson and Ahmad Bradshaw, and guess what? both were effective, especially Bradshaw, who has operated on one leg almost all season. by reducing the workload, he was kept fresh, and boy did he look pretty good in the process.\nAssuming he returns next season – right now it’s probably 50/50 as he’ll likely have to take a pay cut – I hope that he considers following his lead blocking a bit better than he did at times this year.\nA solid showing from Martellus Bennett, who mostly blocked in this one and did so effectively. He spoke the day after about how he hoped to be back next year – he’s an unrestricted free agent – because he believes that another year in this offense will put him and Eli Manning together on the same page, something that wasn’t always evident this year.\nPeople like to pick on offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride – why I honestly don’t know – but give him and the rest of the staff credit for aggressively going after the Eagles’ defense’s weak link, the linebackers, who were at fault for a couple of big Giants pass gains, including one of Manning’s five touchdown throws that came on a wheel route.\nI thought both Giants offensive tackles turned in good games.\nDavid Diehl, who went up against DE Brandon Graham, needed very little help and while Graham was successful with some early game pressures, credit Diehl for tightening his bootstraps and shutting the youngster down.\nWill Beatty was almost spotless in his showing. I don’t think we heard Trent Cole’s name uttered once – and that’s saying a lot considering Cole is one of the Eagles’ best pass rusher, if not their best. While Beatty appeared to be the guilty part who yielded the Eagles’ lone sack, it was hard to tell if Philip Hunt, the linebacker was supposed to be blocked by Kevin Boothe.\nAnd how can I forget the entire organization for reaching out to the Sandy Hook Elementary School community?\nThe Giants hosted roughly 200 teachers, parents, students, and administrators, making them a big part of the pregame ceremony and it was just one of the most touching things I’ve witnessed.\nTo see all those little bundled up children — well let’s just say I didn’t need my binoculars to take note of how wide their eyes were in getting the opportunity to mingle with their heroes. It was simply an awesome way to pay tribute to a community that was rocked to its core by a senseless act of violence that we might never understand.\nAnd along those lines, kudos to the Eagles, who were just as responsive as when they ran out of the tunnel trough the group assembled on their side, their players stopped to high-five all the children. As one of my colleagues had said at the time, that was a sure-fired way to stop the crowd from booing, and sure enough, the Giants fans, always classy, did just that.\nFinally, love him or hate him, former Eagles head coach Andy Reid had a tough season, both personally and professionally. Perhaps the most devastating blow to him was losing his son Garrett back in August, an occurrence that no parent should have to go through.Yet Reid somehow found the strength to carry on and continue to coach, even as the team around him was falling apart. Sure, he’s gotten the better of the Giants these past few years, but I think we can all agree that what he went through what with losing his son puts everything into perspective.\" Read more...\nTHE RED ZONE.\nNFL Trade Rumors - NFL CAP Space\nExcerpt: \"Here’s a look at the NFL cap space for each team.

{"text": "Have read numerous articles that teams are supposedly lining up to make Cruz an offer once FA starts. Public knowledge indicates the GMen will put a first round tender on him so if a team makes him an offer we don't match. We get their 1st round pick. Because the Rams have 2 first round draft picks, I've been hearing they very well use one of those picks to make Cruz a substantial long term offer.\nObviously tampering allegations would be enforced if a team publicly expressed the interest to make an offer to an RFA prior to the FA period, so this all could be a smoke screen being produced by Cruz's agent to create some urgency from the Giants FO, so no one really knows. But the past 2 days I've been hearing more and more of this.\nPersonally, I would love to give Cruz up for a 1st round pick. He's 26 years old, we have Nicks and Randle is looking to break out this year. We could lock down a stud OL and LB/CB with 2 picks in the first round, get considerably younger and have more cap space to sign Nicks to a long term deal. If Cruz does indeed leave for a 1st round pick, 3 picks within the first 2 rounds would do wonders for us. Just my opinion, but with Eli at the helm, he makes everyone around him better. And with a beast, young OL and running game, Eli will have even more time to pick apart defenses.

{"text": "Since we live in FL we have no basement. I'm finding it more difficult, pain in the be hind, to bring things up and down the attic for decorating at Christmas and all the other decorating holidays. Where do you store your stuff if you don't have a basement?, I need ideas!!!\nGuest room closet. Best way in northeast Texas to ruin something is to put it in the attic.\nOther ideas - flat rubbermaid-type storage boxes that will fit under the bed (which was a no-no from my mother while we were growing up, but it works for me).\nA friend of mine...when she was in her late 30s fell down the attic stairs...broke a leg and really messed up an elbow.\nDoes this hat make my butt look big?\nGarage? Off-site storage facility? Extra bedroom?\nHAHA We did not take down the Christmas light decorating the family room for 2 years. We told everyone they were movie lights!\nMy extra bedrooms, which I really have to clean out and organize!\nWell, no basement here although we do have a crawl space WITH lights - owner who built this house was afraid of spiders!\nWe also have an attic with access via the master bedroom closet BUT not really a storage option! I climbed it once when we bought to see the insulation, etc. NOT a place I would ever store things - can't even imagine doing that dance on the ladder while hauling up boxes!\nStorage really isn't an issue for us now but, boy, it used to be at our old home so I do hear you. Do you have a garage? If so, mount reinforced shelving (use Molly bolts) all around about 6 feet up. Garage is still useable for parking cars AND lots of room of storage on shelves. I even have one area on the back wall where I mounted double-shelfs for things stored in flatter boxes...\nHope this helps!\nIf not in the garage, I'd get one of those storage sheds from one of those hardware stores. I think you can get a really nice one, installed, for under 2k.\nYou are my hero\nUnder the bed storage bins are your obvious solution. This is typically dead space and under utilized. Adding extra selves to closets and behind the door storage racks are other areas that are usually wasted space and can be called into duty for seldom used decorations. If space and budget permits, invest in a large wardrobe or armoire w/ shelves. These can be handsome pieces of furniture that conceal items such as decorations. Also, look for areas in your home where you can add high shelves and use decorative boxes to contain decorations. Such places as laundry rooms, office spaces, craft spaces, game rooms, large pantries or even cabinetry in family rooms are typical candidates.\nChristmas time is a nightmare with the tree and all the heavy boxes to put in the attic. We gave up last year and now we are renting a storage unit for the last few years of our decorating. I am ready though to sell all the Christmas decorations and go to a tiny tree, etc. I also think it is a danger to go up and down those rickity attic stairs with huge boxes.\nOur Christmas stuff is in the attic over the garage. DH almost took a tumble this past Christmas while putting stuff back up there. We did break it down into smaller boxes, but still.....\nLife isn't about how to survive the storm, but how to dance in the rain.\nWith no basement and no attic, most of our \"stuff\" has to live in the garage or spare rooms. Having said that, most furniture we bring in to the house does double-duty (night stands are chests for storage or clothes). Under the bed storage boxes and as many bureaus as possible.\nWe have no garage. After 15 years of paying for a storage unit we had a 10 x 12 barn style shed built. It has a half loft which expands storage and is used for long term storage- the lower part is for tools, garden supplies, bikes, and pantry overflow (like when we stock up at the warehouse store). We can also store a ton of wood pellets under the work bench along the back wall. It rains a lot here but the stuff in the shed stays dry.\nThe truth of the matter is that eventually any amount of storage space (garage/attic/basement/shelfs/cupboards/closets) etc will become full if additions are continuously made to possessions. We have a full attic with regular walk up stairs, a full basement (no garage) four bedrooms each with a closet, a very large linen closet, 2 additional spaces (like the small computer room I am in now)\nBesides the regular rooms.\nOf course some spaces are much more challenging than others to store things in esp very small apts.\nOne solutions Spanish Revival is not to decorate for holidays. That is extreme, but it is what we do (or don't do) now. We have a ton of Xmas decorations in the attic and never use them anymore. Or I might buy something say, for Halloween and then discard it right afterwards.\nI collect china (among other things) and large shallow bowls (like vintage and antique wash bowls) can hold a lot and easily fit under pieces of furniture, (like this desk in my d.r.) I also have these bowls under the china closet and another piece of furniture. Napkin rings are kept in a glass jar under a piece of furniture.\nPeople often do not utilize space that is high up in their rooms. A friend keeps all her Xmas decorations on a sort of shelf like projection in a room that has a vaulted ceiling.\nMaybe a new piece of cabinetry can be purchased to esp hold the ornaments and decorations.\nAbout alternative storage - we have a large walk-in closet off our master bath. ALL of our clothes are in there - well all of hubs' clothes and my in-season clothes - including underclothes. Everything.\nThat leaves a rather large dresser with lots of storage space...bed linens and kitchen linens. Each \"kitchen\" drawer has a season's placemats, tablerunners, napkins, cup towels, wall hanging, etc. One drawer has hand embroidered and crocheted scarves from my mother, aunt, grandmother, and great grandmother. Etc.\nDoes this hat make my butt look big?\nNever having a basement, large seasonal decorations are boxed & labled then placed in the garage rafters. Family heirlooms & items that might be compromised by heat cold or humidity are stored indoors (closet) = large table cloths/linens on padded clothes hangers, smaller items wrapped in non acid tissue & boxed.\nWe rarely decorate for quasi holidays.... the winter-theme wreath (front door) has been replaced with spring flowers This message has been edited. Last edited by: tessa89,\nThank-you everyone for responding and giving me a bunch of great ideas that I can really put to good use. Everyone had at least one idea I can put into effect, in fact we started today with categorizing and getting everything in plastic stackable bins. Everything is looking better already! Thanks Again!\nIn my garage we installed those loft shelf things for camping gear and they hold quite a lot. I really like them.\nFrom time spent living in the south I learned that anything stored for any length of time HAD to be in closed containers...palmetto bugs (roaches, to northerners), tree frogs and lizards can find their way into just about anything. Plastic boxes with tight fitting lids are a must! We had a pull down ladder to the attic which wasn't so bad...we went up there all the time (in the winter...too darn hot the other 9 months of the year )\n**Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass...it's about learning to dance in the rain**\nA lot of \"secret storage\"... ottomans that open up, containers that slide under couches. If there isn't a place to hide a container, I use a \"pretty\" container or basket that matches the decor of the room. I don't know if you could use a window seat or bench, but I've seen them made out of trunks, using pretty cushions that sit on top.\nI have no attic, basement or garage.. but I do have a beautifully built shed- with a loft.\nLong term storage is in the back of the loft.\nChristmas decorations are in the front. Tools, bikes, pantry overflow- below.\nSince we built our own house & I drew it...I included plenty of storage. But we also floored most of the attic. We have a pull down stair for it and DH rigged a pulley with a large basket on it that I can take things up/down without carrying them up/down the stairs...it works for me! You could attach lots of different things, like a tote, for taking things up/down.\n\"The soil is the source of life, creativity, culture and real independence.\" David Ben-Gurion\n|Powered by Social Strata|", "id": "<urn:uuid:59b17b77-805e-49da-9c55-2f722fa3298d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://boards.hgtv.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/4284011632/m/3133942757?r=7333964757", "date": "2013-05-18T08:11:57Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9565284252166748, "token_count": 1922, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "by Bob Mackreth\nShunning human contact, the brooding, bearded man retreated to the woods, hiding himself away in a tiny cabin devoid of comforts. No one knew for sure what private demons pursued him- some said that he nursed a wounded heart, others hinted that he hoarded an ill-gotten treasure. Many thought him uncouth, but others described him as a gentleman, well educated. Just about everyone agreed it was best to keep far away from him, though. \"He was sullen and ugly,\" one writer recalls, \"and on several occasions it is said that he used his gun to drive away unwelcome meddlers.\" He refused to pay taxes, and once greeted a visiting sheriff with a loaded rifle.\nA character from today's headlines? No, the long-ago hermit of Hermit Island.\nThe tale of the Hermit is a story filled with violence, romance, and wealth. Or maybe not- it's hard to say. You see, since there was nothing written about the Hermit during his lifetime, writers and tale spinners over the ensuing century-and-a-half have felt free to make things up as they went along. As one writer confessed, \"There are a number of different versions to this tale. The author has chosen the one which most appealed to him.\"\nThe Hermit's name was William Wilson or maybe it wasn't. Some accounts claim that his name was anything but Wilson, and that the pseudonym concealed a dark past.\n\"Nothing is known of his early life,\" says one writer, \"He came from no one knew where.\" Not so, says another: \"He was born in Canada of Scottish parents,\" confidently adding that the year was 1792, and the place was Sault Ste. Marie.\nMost sources agree that Wilson was a fur trader in his youth, and roamed the mountains as far as the Pacific Ocean. Tiring of the wandering life, one account tells how he walked cross-country, hoping to return to the land of his birth. Arriving there, he found his parents dead, his former sweetheart married.\nIt seems that few writers could resist the temptation to place a woman at the center of the Hermit's story. An 1890's account describes a mysterious moment:\nOne day a friend found him sleeping beside the cabin. He did not disturb him. But out of his dreams he awoke, and in an agonizing cry he uttered one word \"Estelle!\"\nHmmm who might this mysterious lady have been? Perhaps she was a woman wronged: one source says that at the age of 18, \"he ran away from home, deserting a young French girl he was to have married.\" Not true, says another account: \"He had a wife and daughter at L'Anse, in upper Michigan, who he took out to the Columbia River and there deserted. Later, repenting of this cruelty, he sought to reclaim them and found they had been murdered.\"\nPerhaps there was no wife, no French girl, no \"Estelle.\" Who can be certain? But surely we must know more about his life once he appeared in the Apostle Islands country! Indeed, the stories do grow more detailed, the tellers more confident. He came to LaPointe in 1841, we are told, and worked as a cooper, or barrel maker. His employer, John Bell, was every bit as fierce as Wilson, and just a bit tougher, it seems. The two men came to blows one day in 1847, and we hear that Bell laid Wilson out with one punch. Humiliated, Wilson vowed he would never stay on an island where he was not the best man, and so loaded a canoe with provisions and set off to an island where no man would ever be his better.\nThere, on what is now called Hermit Island, Wilson built a log cabin, planted a garden, and raised chickens. To earn a few dollars, he kept up his work as a cooper. Fishermen would stop by to purchase barrels for their catch, but the Hermit did not encourage them to linger. Yet some writers say he had no need to raise cash. They say that on his rare trips to town, he attracted attention by paying for supplies from a purse filled with silver Mexican coins. Others whispered of a store of gold, buried somewhere near his cabin.\nPerhaps this rumor of hidden wealth led to the Hermit's death. In 1861, he was found \"dead in his cabin, where he had undoubtedly been murdered evidently by parties in search of his wealth.\" There was \"evidence of a violent death struggle, crude furniture broken, the trunk empty, money bags missing.\"\n\"Not exactly,\" says another story: it was whiskey that laid him low. \"Wilson had died of delirium tremens as misshapen monsters appeared against the mud-lined walls of his lonely cabin, he forced his trembling old body to go after them until life wrenched from it in a final, violent convulsion.\"\nOh, my! Amid all this embellishment, what do we really know about Wilson the hermit? We can be confident that he did exist- that in the decade before the Civil War, a tormented man spent his declining years all but shut-off from human society on a lonely island in Lake Superior. Beyond that, it seems that the Hermit will forever remain a man of mystery.\nOne suspects he would have preferred it that way.\nTo learn about...\nPlease note: the Scrapbook articles are presented here for public information and education only.

{"text": "It seems to be the season of \"Top 10\" in blogland. Both FilmiGirl and the Post-Punk Cinema Club have put up their selection of top 10 songs for various decades. Never having done a top 10 of anything before, I promptly and shamelessly decided to copy the idea. However, to weed out Top 10 songs from literally hundreds of songs every decade is a Herculean task and a beginner like me needs something much simpler. After much cogitation I settled on Top 10 Comedies simply because great comedies in Bollywood appear but rarely and it shouldnt be hard to select 10. Having committed myself to the task, I realised that Bollywood has way too many great comedies to make this any easier than top 10 songs!\nWhat you see here is the result of sheer hard work and days of frantic weeding and ruthless trimming - I've even managed to limit myself to only two comedies each from directors Basu Chatterji and Hrishikesh Mukherji who between them were responsible for most of the great comedies in the 70s and 80s!\nIf jest be the food of life, read on... and dont forget to tell me about your favorite comedies.\n10. Andaz Apna Apna (1994) - Yaallah!!\nTwo bumbling young men meet up on the path of get-rich-quick by attempting to marry the same rich girl. Alternately collaborating and competing with each other for their heiress, they run into bizarre villains, confusing look-alikes and every possible situation that a hero of a successful 70s masala block-buster could look forward to. From these trials they emerge triumphant, with their love-lives and fortunes made. What makes it especially amusing is its use of cliches to create a hilarious parody of masala movies. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan as the aspiring fortune-hunters are uproariously funny and ably supported by their heroines - Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor - their villains - Shakti Kapoor, Shehzad Khan and Viju Khote - and the goody-baddy lookalikes played by Paresh Rawal. Raj Kumar Santoshi's tongue-in-cheek nod to 70s Bollywood still has me in splits everytime I watch it, though I havent watched it as often as Veracious seems to have!\n9. Hungama (2003) - chaos in the midst of chaos\nAn insane comedy in the best tradition of screwball comedies - this one would do P. G. Wodehouse proud. Two strangers - Nandu (Aftab Shivdasani) and Anjali (Rimi Sen) - arriving in Mumbai to make their fortunes, pretend to be a married couple to rent a cheap apartment. Anjali is mistaken for reclusive millionaire Radheshyam Tiwari's (Paresh Rawal) daughter by the mercenary Jeetu (Akshaye Khanna) who proceeds to woo her. Tiwari's wife (Shoma Anand) suspects him of having an affair with Anjali while Tiwari himself suspects that his wife is sweet on Jeetu. Throw in a few more misunderstandings and co-incidences, several more zany characters and you have a laughathon on your hands!\n8. Yahan Wahan (1984) - beguiling bluffs\nA lighthearted romantic comedy starring Farooq Shaikh and Surinder Kaur (you've seen her as Saif's Mom in Parineeta). Boy meets girl and the girl sets out to impress him with her wealth by lending him her luxurious apartment. The only problem is that the apartment isnt hers - she's been given the contract to decorate it for the rich absentee owner who just happens to be her new boyfriend! (I saw this one years ago and am still looking for its DVD.)\n7. Pasand Apni Apni (1983) - a miss-understanding\nAn insane misunderstanding that leads to love. Here, an almost-out-of-work actress - Geeta (Rati Agnihotri) - accepts a ride from the chauffeur of wealthy industrialist Sandeep Anand. She is seen descending from Sandeep's limo and assumed to be his fiancé, all unbeknownst to herself. As a result, wonderful things begin to happen to her - her theatre company makes her the leading lady of all their productions, she is courted and fêted wherever she goes and a journalist (Mithun Chakraborty) becomes her constant shadow. She finds herself falling for him only to find out that he is none other than Sandeep Anand! Directed by Basu Chatterji, this fun comedy also stars Utpal Dutt, Ashok Kumar, Subbiraj, Javed Khan and several of my favorite 80s TV stars.\n6. Miss Mary (1957) - mirth and melody\nMeena Kumari in a rare comedic role while she was still unaffected by alcohol and melancholia - that alone makes this movie worth watching. But that isnt all. She plays Mary, an out-of-work teacher unsuccessfully looking for a job.\nWhen fellow teacher Arun (Gemini Ganeshan) suggests that they pretend to be married for a job advertised for married couples, she reluctantly agrees. They get the job and land-up having to live as man and wife with a wacko private eye (Kishore Kumar) watching over them while a beautiful student falls for Arun. Throw in some lost-and-found daughters, comic villains and some of 50s best loved songs and you have an entertaining comedy to while away the hours! Check out MemsaabStory's excellent write-up for a comprehensive review.\n5. Angoor (1982) - pandemonium personified\nAn adaptation of Shakespeare's Comedy Of Errors, the movie involves two sets of identical twins - a pair of Ashoks and their pair of twin servants named Bahadur - with one of each pair separated in childhood. They are brought up in different cities and while one Ashok and his Bahadur are married to Sudha (Moushumi Chatterji) and Prema (Aruna Irani), respectively, the other Ashok-Bahadur pair is unmarried. Chance brings the bachelors to the city of their married twins and utter chaos ensues with nobody (including themselves and their wives) realising that there are two Ashoks and Bahadurs.\nIn the comedy of errors that ensues, the unmarried Ashok finds himself falling for Sudha's beautiful sister Tanu (Deepti Naval) who thinks he is married to her sister! The resulting situations are hilarious and milked for all their humor by the excellent dialogue and screenplay written by director Gulzar. Caution: a side effects of watching this movie is severe stitch-in-the-side from laughing too much.\n4. Naram Garam (1981) - a convoluted story\nOne of director Hrishikesh Mukherji's lesser known comedies, this one is the story of an enterprising young man who manages to please everybody while serving his own ends. Ramprasad (Amol Palekar) is the enterprising young man who houses his lady-love Kusum (Swaroop Sampat) and her father (A. K. Hangal) in an old house owned by his employer Bhavani Shankar (Utpal Dutt). The comedy derives from his attempts to prevent their discovery and ultimate eviction from the property. Ramprasad cleverly exploits the very human weaknesses of his employer and fellow colleagues to bring about his own happily-ever-after. Apart from Amol Palekar and Utpal Dutt's expectedly brilliant performances, the other memorable performance is that of Shatrughan Sinha as Babua - Bhavani Shankar's younger brother who is keen on body-building and avoiding women but promptly forgets these in the light of Kusum's beauty!\n3. Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986) - droll diversion\nAn off-beat comedy by Basu Chatterji starring Anil Kapoor, Amrita Singh and Amjad Khan that takes a humorous look at life and romance in a small-town. Chameli (Amrita Singh) is the grown up daughter of coal-seller Nathilal (Pankaj Kapoor). Her scholarly ambitions make her stick to high school inspite of failing multiple times and her romanic disposition makes her pursue Charandas (Anil Kapoor) an unemployed chela (disciple) of the local pehelwaan (wrestler) Ustaad Mastram (Om Prakash). Charandas succumbs to Chameli's charms and the romance is helped along by Charandas's guru in matters of romance - Advocate Harish (Amjad Khan in a rare comedic role).\nTheir hilarious romance and its amusingly filmi aftermath is brilliantly utilised to sketch a picture of small-town life. The performance of the principals and the rest of the cast (which also includes several TV and stage actors of the day) is superb and the movie never fails to tickle my funny bone.\n2. Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958) - flippant fun\nA Marx-brothers-meet-Bollywood-masala type of comedy that has entertained people for half a century. Three brothers Brijmohan, Jagmohan, and Manmohan (real-life brothers Ashok Kumar, Anup Kumar, and Kishore Kumar, respectively) run a garage that does not cater to customers of the female sex. When Renu (Madhubala) turns up at the garage one night to get her car repaired, she triggers a storm in this bastion of masculinity. Manmohan falls for her and flouts elder brother Brijmohan's diktat against women. Apart from facing Brijmohan's misogynism, the young lovers have to battle murderers masquerading as princes, they need to don funny disguises, go on hilarious car-chases and help Manmohan's two elder brothers find love, too. (Check out Filmi Geek's excellent write-up for an in-depth review) An old favorite, this is a fast-paced laugh-riot that never fails to bring on he laughs even after several re-watches!\n1. Chupke Chupke (1975) - a jest in time\nAn all-time favorite, this Hrishikesh Mukherji-directed film is a delicious blend of witty dialogues and insane situations that come together in a wacky comedy (fellow-blogizens Beth and Carla agree!). After a comic whirlwind romance, famous botanist Dr. Parimal Tripathi (Dharmendra) marries botany-fangirl Sulekha (Sharmila Tagore) only to be regaled endlessly with praises of her brother-in-law Raghav (Om Prakash) whom he's never met. To take his rightful position as numero uno in Sulekha's esteem, he decides to play a practical joke on Raghav.

It involves two struggling photographers - Vinod (Nasseeruddin Shah) and Sudhir (Ravi Baswani) - who inadvertently photograph the commission of a murder. They don the hats of private investigators and their investigations lead them into the murky world of Bombay real-estate. Their bumbling attempts to find the murderer and expose the scandals in the real-estate business make for hilarious situations. The movie comes complete with impeccable pedigree - apart from Nasseer and Baswani, the cast includes Om Puri, Pankaj Kapoor, Satish Shah, Satish Kaushik, Neena Gupta and Vidhu Vinod Chopra (according to imdb), plus several other leading theatre and TV actors of the day. Needless to say, the performances are superb! A movie that successfully combines slapstick with biting satire and doesnt fail to bring on the laughs.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0cd05bfa-8e83-4b2a-8841-c763d48deaec>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bollyviewer-oldisgold.blogspot.com/2008/08/come-lets-laugh-top-10-bollywood.html?showComment=1320866904259", "date": "2013-05-18T07:12:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9521111845970154, "token_count": 2912, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "But there is another game that publishers and authors sometimes play that is every bit as dishonest as a tainted review: the use of meaningless book blurbs written by friends who trade rave blurbs about each others' books in an attempt to increase sales for both. We've all seen them, and seasoned readers learn to recognize them for what they are pretty quickly, but they probably do work more times than not. The New York Times Sunday Book Review talks about the practice in today's issue:\nThe endorsements on books aren’t entirely impartial. Unbeknownst to the average reader, blurbs are more often than not from the writer’s best friends, colleagues or teachers, or from authors who share the same editor, publisher or agent. They represent a tangled mass of friendships, rivalries, favors traded and debts repaid, not always in good faith. There’s some debate about whether blurbs actually help sell books, but publishers agree they can’t hurt. Often, agents try to solicit blurbs even before a publisher buys a book....\nFor writers, to blurb or not to blurb can be a tricky matter. Blurb too little and you’ll have a hard time drumming up the requisite superlatives when your turn comes. Blurb too often, or include too many blurbs on your book, and you might get called a blurb whore.The article goes on to separate \"blurbing\" into the three subsets of \"blurbing down,\" \"blurbing up,\" and \"lateral blurbing,\" all based on the industry reputation of the author providing the dust jacket quote. Blurbing up occurs when a lesser known writer provides a blurb for an author better known than himself (something he will jump at the chance to do, of course), blurbing down is the opposite (and, I suspect, is the source of the most honest blurbs being used), and blurbing laterally is likely to be the source of countless back-scratching blurbs that are especially meaningless.\nWhatever you think about blurbs, and whether or not they influence you in the least, this is an interesting article.

{"text": "After the waters pass\nSet aside your spring chores and cancel the rest of your plans when you pick up The Winter Vault. Thirteen years after her first novel, Fugitive Pieces, Canadian writer Anne Michaels unfolds the unforgettable story of Avery and Jean, who meet near land flooded by the St. Lawrence Seaway project. After their marriage, they live in Egypt, where Avery is an engineer responsible for rescuing the temples at Abu Simbel from the floodwaters of the Nile, as part of the Aswan High Dam construction in the mid-1960s. In both projects, lives and memories are uprooted with the landscape as entire communities are relocated. Michaels uses the structure of the novel to portray this displacement and this dislocation, juxtaposing water against desert, flow against flood, showing some of the ways people respond to emotional and physical dislocation.\nIn Egypt, Avery works with old sandstone and modern plans, while Jean observes the locals and tries to understand their lives. When their first child dies in utero, their relationship breaks. Their loss is the stone in the river that a Nubian friend describes as the one that splits the waters.\nBack in Canada, Avery does not know how to help Jean—or himself—grieve, and leaves her. She becomes involved with Lucjan, an older man who survived the war as a Jewish orphan in Warsaw, and is now known as the Caveman because of the paintings he creates on Toronto fences late at night. He draws Jean, and they become lovers. It is Lucjan’s stories—and his challenges—that help Jean start to return to life. A year after their daughter’s death, Jean and Avery meet, unplanned, at her grave, and begin to walk back to each other.\nMichaels is the author of three books of poetry, and her phrases and images echo back and forth through the novel. The title refers to the buildings where bodies wait until the ground thaws and graves can be dug, a metaphor for the temporary holding place we all visit in our lives, but rarely name. The Winter Vault requires close reading, but when you finish, you’ll want to turn back and read it all again.\nLeslie Budewitz lives and writes near Flathead Lake in western Montana.", "id": "<urn:uuid:07aef34d-c63e-48d4-8685-3ef69c596c20>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bookpage.com/review/the-winter-vault/after-the-waters-pass", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9685145020484924, "token_count": 467, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "You'll Never Nanny in This Town Again: The True Adventures of a Hollywood Nanny (Paperback)\nNew and completely updated edition\nHilarious and addictive, this chronicle of a small-town girl’s stint as a celebrity nanny reveals what really happens in the diaper trenches of Hollywood.\nWhen Oregon native Suzanne Hansen becomes a live-in nanny to the children of Hollywood über-agent Michael Ovitz, she thinks she’s found the job of her dreams. But Hansen’s behind-the-scenes access soon gets her much more than she bargained for: working twenty-four hours a day, juggling the shifting demands of the Hollywood elite, and struggling to comprehend wealth unimaginable to most Americans, not to mention dealing with the expected tantrums and the unexpected tense–and intense–atmosphere in the house where she lives with her employers.\nWhen the thankless drudgery takes its toll and Hansen finally quits, her boss threatens to blackball her from ever nannying in Hollywood again. Discouraged but determined, Hansen manages to land gigs with Debra Winger and then Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman. Attentive, welcoming parents with a relaxed attitude toward celebrity–looks like Hansen’s fallen into a real-life happy ending. But the round-the-clock workdays continue, rubbing some of the glitter off L.A. living, and Hansen’s not sure how much longer she can pretend to be Mary Poppins. Even bosses who treat her like family can’t help as she struggles to find meaning in her work while living in a town that seems to lack respect for nannies and everyone else who comes in the employee’s entrance–but without whom many showbiz households would grind to a halt.\nPeppering her own journey with true stories and high drama experienced by other nannies to the stars, Hansen offers an intriguing, entertaining mix of tales from the cribs of the rich and famous. You’ll Never Nanny in This Town Again is a treat for everyone who is fascinated by the skewed priorities of Tinseltown, for anyone who has wondered how high-wattage supermoms do it all, and for readers who love peeking behind the curtains of celebrity, all of whom will devour this unparalleled–and unabashedly true–account of one girl’s tour of duty as Hollywood’s hired help.\nAbout the Author\nSuzanne Hansen has been a high-risk labor and delivery nurse, lactation consultant, and childbirth educator.

In 2004, he won the Whiting Award for emerging writers. Other honors include a 2003 National Magazine Award for feature writing and a 2003 Eclipse Award for writing about horse racing. He was also a PEN Literary Award finalist.\nA complex book, “Blood Horses” combines memoir — the author’s father was a longtime sportswriter for the Louisville Courier-Journal — with the history, lore and breeding of thoroughbred race horses, aong with a look at Kentucky’s geology, heritage and agri-business milieu.\nSullivan’s current book project is a non-fiction treatise on an 18th century Utopian who lived in what is now Tennessee before the Revolutionary War.\nCo-founed in 1953 by George Plimpton, Peter Matthiessen and Harold L.

{"text": "Myself and other more important matters\nAmacom Books, 2006 - 213 halaman\nThe book was selected as one of STRATEGY + BUSINESS Best Business Books of 2008. The book was also selected by Leadershipnow.com as one of The Best Leadership Books of 2008. One of the world's most influential living management thinkers, Charles Handy has year-after-year been listed alongside business gurus including Peter Drucker and Tom Peters in the prestigious Thinkers 50 list. His views on management and life have inspired and enlightened others for decades. Now, in Myself and Other More Important Matters, the bestselling author of books including The Age of Unreason shares his special brand of wisdom, giving readers uncommon insight into business and careers...as well as the choices we all have to make in our lives. Handy draws on the lessons of his own experience to help readers move beyond the facts they learned in business school and reflect on their own individual management style. With the philosophical elegance and eloquence Warren Bennis has described as his trademark, Handy discusses how one should develop one's career goals in line with personal values and sense of ethics. Handy entertainingly recounts what he's discovered along his own international journey: from lessons his father taught him growing up in Ireland to what he learned in Borneo in his days working for Royal Dutch Shell to Italy, where he bought and fixed up an old house in Tuscany all the way to America, where recent corporate scandals have shaken our understanding of what is ethical and acceptable. Throughout the book, Handy asks us to look at the role of work in our life, and what we truly find fulfilling. It is hard to imagine a better or wiser guide to work and life's big questions.", "id": "<urn:uuid:21582b70-b656-4e45-af99-4db7148dccd1>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://books.google.co.id/books?id=wvG6yYImUt4C&q=things&hl=id&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=5", "date": "2013-05-18T06:54:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9676293134689331, "token_count": 355, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Social Media can help unite us in times of crisis. Within moments, social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Youtube connect the world with the voices and images on the ground as well our own global reactions. We give you here one more reason that you should be participating in social media if you aren’t yet, as well as important links to information and ways to help the tragic situation in Japan following the devastating earthquake and tsunami.\nOur first alert in Kauai to the huge, tragic Japan earthquake was at 9PM Thursday night, March 10. We attended first to preparations for a tsunami predicted for 3AM our time. There was little sleep for everyone on Kauai and the rest of the state of Hawaii with tsunami warning sirens going off every hour from 10PM through 3AM with a bonus at 2:30AM. Residents from homes and vacation rentals directly at the coast needed to evacuate and we supported that effort by taking in a few people. As it turned out, the tsunami effect in Hawaii was very limited but given the magnitude of the quake and tsunami in Japan, it was certainly better to be safe than sorry.\nWe immediately got on Twitter @KauaiTalk @LindaSherman @RayJGordon and Facebook to make sure that our local friends in Hawaii were aware of the warnings and were taking precautions. We passed on news and responded to questions using the hash tag# created for the local event: #HITsunami.\nAll night, we watched the first shocking, horrifying and heartbreaking images that CNN could get a hold of. CNN didn’t have many that first night and kept running them over and over but we kept coming back to watch. My husband Ray and I lived in Japan for more than 13 years beginning in late 1993. (I was there for an additional 8 years before that). We were very worried about our friends in Japan. We checked for whatever social media we could find and also bothered them with emails.\nAt times of humanitarian crisis or when a nation or the world is focused on a special event, social media brings us together. Twitter in particular is very immediate. I wrote about this phenomenon calling it the Twitter Shared Experience. Facebook Pages that are open to updates can also be very useful. Blogs follow and allow us to share stories that support all of us. Information shared through social media is helpful to those in need and it links us all together, in all of our humanity.\nSocial Media for Social Good\nSocial media can be used for Social Good. You may have seen stories written about “social influencers” people whose voices carry to many thousands of listeners through their followers on Twitter, Facebook and blogs. In these times of crisis, these influencers can be a positive force. But so can each and everyone of us. You can share your voice on Twitter by including a # in your tweet such as #HelpJapan. People who use Twitter search can create a stream of information by putting that # in their Twitter search bar.* You can contribute your voice to the Facebook Pages I have listed here. You can comment on relevant websites and blogs or post a blog yourself.\nI worked in Japan as an executive and was one of the few foreign participants in the Nihon Keizai Doyukai (Japan Associate of Corporate Executives). The Keizai Doyukai produces white papers for consideration by the Japanese government. There are few foreigners in this organization because it is conducted entirely in Japanese and requires the ability to not only speak Japanese but read Japanese in order to fully participate. I participated in several committees that touched on the image of Japan to the world.\nJapan is a huge international aid contributor but they never talk about it. Japanese are humble by nature and do not brag about what they do. I am hoping that this crisis ultimately drags more English capable Japanese onto social media to communicate with the rest of the world about Japan. This will be part of an overall change from a rather insular society to one that is more fully linked with the rest of the world. We can help Japan financially and emotionally through our support delivered through social media platforms.\nFollowing is the list of links* that I have collected so far. This has been a labor of love and I hope you find it useful. You are invited to add useful links that I have missed in the comments.\nSocial Good – Giving\nList of Local Japanese Organizations Providing Direct Support Links to their English pages selected as trustworthy by Todd Wassel and his Japanese wife who are both professional aid and recovery workers with the United Nations\nTokyo IS Support Tokyo International School & TEDxTokyo communities have partnered with Second Harvest Japan to receive needed supplies at Tokyo International School for immediate delivery to the disaster areas (local donations)\nSeven Ways to Help from Mashable a leader in Social Media news and analysis\nSouth by SouthWest SXSW Giving\nSXSW* – Use your social media influence to help Japan message – Red Cross\nTime Magazine – Five Ways You Can Help\nHow You Can Help from Tokyo Time Out\nUSAID.gov links to this Interaction list of charities\nThere are additional references to charities within many of the links on this page.\nCelebrities are making major contributions, some direct and some collecting donations through fans such as Lady Gaga with a Pray for Japan wristband.\nOn corporate or non-profit giving: some people have objected to requests for passing forward the word on Twitter through retweets (Microsoft for Bing) or joining Fan Pages to raise money but Charlie Weingarten at Dog Bless You smartly replied: Some people ask why I don’t just give the money. Because together we are far stronger than working alone. Others are suggesting that Apple is taking a cut of contributions through iTunes (they are not!). I have to admit that I personally didn’t like a 2009 cancer campaign on Twitter that appeared to be all about breaking a guinness record so that a particular PR agency could show they had clout (without acknowledging major players that had helped them along the way). But while using caution to only contribute through organizations you trust, we need not be stingy with our Facebook likes and our Twitter RT’s (retweets). Microsoft quickly decided to just donate the $100,000 instead of continuing their RT campaign but ultimately, continuing to spread the word is good for everyone and … why is it that we need to begrudge these organizations some positive PR?\nUseful Japan Disaster Dedicated Sites\nGoogle Crisis Response includes flight cancellation status and other useful updated information (English)\nWikipedia current disaster page filled with useful links and updates\nPress Releases from the Prime Minister of Japan related to Measures Being Taken\nOlive – Advice Wiki for emergency areas in English and Japanese by @_nosigner\nWiki for Earthquake Info\nAmerican Embassy in Japan\nFukushima International Association\nLive News Streams from Japan – English\nNHK World (Japan’s national TV station) has is providing livestream with full earthquake/tsunami coverage on this NHK Ustream Link\nLive News Streams from Japan – Japanese\nTBS Channel on UStream.\nUseful Sites About Japan Providing Updates\nYokoso – Japan Culture, Lifestyle and Entertainment based in Yokkaichi, Mie, Japan\nEntertainment Magazine in Japan – Time Out Tokyo\nJapan Times – English Language Newspaper in Japan\nTokyo Post Online News Magazine\nJapan Today Online News Magazine\nGaijin Pot Online Live, Work, Play Magazine for Foreigners in Japan\nGoogle People Finder\nUseful Facebook Pages in English – includes Giving\neJournal USA published by the United States Department of State, Bureau of International Information Programs\nHelp Save Japan at SXSW\nPrayer for Tsunami Victims in Japan (fortunately has non-prayer related info as well)\nRescue Dog Organization: Explore Dogs\nTokyo International School Emergency Supply Center\nTwitter Corporate Produced (in both Japanese and English) helpful links and useful hash tags.\nSearch for essential local Japan earthquake crisis information in English on Twitter\nTwitter #Hash Tags*\nI am seeing tweets that say ‘instead of #PrayforJapan please use #HelpJapan’ and I agree!

The vowels in Japanese are the same as in Spanish so it is relatively simple to pronounce Japanese words. I produced this little Japanese pronunciation tutorial with audio during a raft of news anchor mispronunciations of the word karaoke during the holiday season.\nFailure of Closed Social Media Systems – American Chamber of Commerce\nACCJ (American Chamber of Commerce) should be an important resource to American companies doing business in Japan. They have recently put up a Facebook Page and Twitter feed. Unfortunately, they have set their Facebook Page as a fairly closed system that does not encourage others to update. Their LinkedIn Group moderates comments (slowly!) so there is little activity there as well.\nWhy Japan Will Emerge Stronger After the Earthquake\nWe were in Japan during the Kobe (Hanshin/Awaji) earthquake in January 1995. Japan refused international assistance during that disaster which proved to be a regrettable decision. The spirit of cooperation both internally and internationally during this horrible tragedy and in the rebuilding to follow should be a positive force.\n*Boomer Tech Talk Guide to Technical Words Used in this Article:\nHashtag: Used in Twitter, written #. This is used to create a stream in Twitter of all tweets that include that #. Using the hashtag allows Twitter uses to follow particular topics and events using the search bar in Twitter without needing to go to any particular one source. Twitter refers to some of these hashtags as “trending topics”. You can search for a key word with using the hashtag but the # encourages people to use the same word, making it easy to find a stream of information or commentary on one topic.\nSXSW: Stands for South by Southwest. A huge annual music/film/social media conference held in Austin (this year March 11 – March 20, starting shortly after the earthquake hit Japan)\nLinks: You can click on a live link to get to a website, including a Facebook Page. I have not made the Twitter profiles into live links so when you see @name you need to enter http://Twitter.com/name to get to the link.\nWe hope that if you are not yet participating in social media, this article has given you one more reason to take that step. Social media can help you cope with a crisis in your personal or business life with immediate information and emotional support.\nI would greatly appreciate it if you add useful links that I may have missed in the comments.", "id": "<urn:uuid:403bb0da-0259-4ce2-b790-87b3da9ed741>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://boomertechtalk.com/social-media-in-times-of-crisis-japan-earthquake-tsunami/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:25:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.927487850189209, "token_count": 3053, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational;Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Filed underPolitical Blog Progressive\nLast night, Republican Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan addressed the Republican National Convention. After a shaky start, Ryan became comfortable with the TelePrompter and delivered a talking points filled speech that was well received in the Convention Hall and drew positive reviews.\nBut if Paul Ryan tried to submit his speech as a school paper he would draw a F for failing to do even the most basic checking of his facts.\nIf Paul Ryan turned that speech in to an editor it would be either covered in corrective red ink or unrecognizable if the editor chose to use track changes and emailed it back. Or they would simply reply: start over.\nIf a CEO received a paper from his staff full of such glairing inaccuracies Paul Ryan would be looking for a new job this morning.\nWhile Paul Ryan is entitled to his own opinions, he is not entitled to his own facts.\nMaybe if he spent less time doing P90X and more time doing the most basic research his speech would not have been filled with little white lies.\nHe lied to America about Medicare. He lied to America about the debt commission. He really lied to America about the stimulus and America’s debt rating.\nHe went out of his way to lie and blame President Obama for a plant closing that happened when George W. Bush was President. That is a bold lie to tell America when your boss wrote an op-ed that demanded that we “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt”.\nAcross the Midwest auto plants are adding jobs, like in Lordstown, Ohio where they make the Chevy Cruise and keep adding shifts. If W. Mitt Romney had his way those jobs would not be in Lordstown or anywhere else in the US.\nWhen it comes to the stimulus, Ryan likes to call it “a case of political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism at their worst.” He lied to a reporter’s face about requesting stimulus money and he lied to America about it last night.\nRyan also lied when he said the “American people were cut off” from the benefits. The payroll tax reduction that put dollars in people’s pockets hardly left them cut off from the stimulus. The stimulus built and repaired roads and bridges they use every day don’t leave them cut off.\nJust another Paul Ryan little white lie to America.\nThe fact is, that Paul Ryan requested tens of millions in stimulus dollars, voted for an alternate stimulus in 2009 and spoke on the House floor of the benefits of stimulus and borrowing money to boost the economy, when George W. Bush was President.\nPaul Ryan’s white lie to America on the Debt Commission is that he voted against it. He failed to mention that when he criticized Obama for not acting urgently on the recommendations that Ryan, himself, opposes.\nThat is a cleaver little lie to America for a deceitful person.\nPaul Ryan blamed Obama for the decline in America’s credit rating. That is a big lie coming from the leader of the Tea Party House that scuttled a budget deal and threatened to throw America into default as a temper tantrum.\nBut Paul Ryan does not want America to know about his tantrums or his record.\nThe kid has a lot to learn.\nBut the biggest of Paul Ryan’s little white lies to America was saved for Medicare. Ryan criticized Obama for reductions in Medicare and lied when he said benefits were cut. The fact is, and Paul Ryan knows it, that the cuts are in fees for services and those reductions are used to create efficiencies in the way we deliver health care. That helps the economy and improves the long-term outlook for Medicare.\nRaul Ryan, if he were an honest man, would tell you that in his budget roadmap he kept the Obama Medicare payment reductions but used the savings to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, not to reduce our national health care costs.\nHe also failed to tout his couponing scheme that ends Medicare and raises the cost of health care for seniors while lining the pockets of the health insurance industry.\nBut Paul Ryan knows that the truth is politically toxic.\nSo instead he tells lie after lie to America about Medicare, the debt, the auto recovery, the economy and the stimulus. But mostly he lies about his record.\nThere is a reason that the Obama campaign, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wanted to make the Ryan Budget the focus of this election.\nFirst, it is the most detailed policy outline of the Republican Party and every Republican has voted for a version of it or promised to support it.\nSecond, it is a political loser. It is the skunk at the garden party. And that is why Republican House and Senate candidates are not happy with a Romney-Ryan ticket (and Democratic candidates were, to say the least, overjoyed). It is why those Republican candidates have run as fast as they can away from their record of supporting Paul Ryan and his radical plan to end Medicare.\nEven W. Mitt Romney immediately tried to distance himself from his running mate. He clearly believed that he could pick Paul Ryan to be a heartbeat away from the presidency but expect everyone to ignore the Ryan record.\nA monumentally dumb belief.\nAbout Bill Buck\nBill Buck is a Democratic strategist, President of the Buck Communications Group, a media relations and new media strategies consulting business based in Washington, DC, and Managing Director of the online ad firm Influence DSP.

{"text": "Efforts to incorporate Bowmanstown as a borough occurred as early as 1892. The village contained about 300 inhabitants in 1896 but the nearby New Jersey Zinc Company soon added to its growth. Bowmanstown was incorporated as a Borough on November 29, 1913 for the purpose of providing general local government services to residents of the community. Upon incorporation of Bowmanstown as a borough its boundaries encompassed lands measuring 0.75 square mile. The borough's assessed valuation in 1918 was $279,000.00. The population of 834 in 1920 remained relatively constant for decades. The Bowmanstown Borough Municipal Building (Borough Hall) is a converted school building that was constructed in 1903 to serve the youths of the community. In 1958, the Palmerton School District was established and combined several local schools in order to create a regional school thus making the Bowmanstown campus obsolete. In 1964, the Borough acquired the old brick school building and has been using it as offices ever since. The borough kept the building in its original condition.\nThe Bowmanstown Borough Authority was incorporated August 24, 1997 and was created for the purpose of owning and operating the Bowmanstown Public Water System. On February 11, 2002 the Authority began construction of its water system improvement project which included a new chlorine building, looping numerous water mains, installing new services, erection of a new 250,000 gallon Standpipe and a new liner to the one Reservoir.

It was hard, because it's a new set that we're playing and so there's a lot of things to iron out. And we had quite a tense time in the days before it in that we arrived in Ontario but our equipment didn't and, um, it finally turned up just a little while before the show. So it was an enormous relief for everybody, but I think the tension worked its way into all of us. So, yeah, we did it. The crowd liked it but, you know, we were quite critical of ourselves. You know, we usually know it can be a lot better.\nJW: I heard a lot of positive things about your performance as well as Mark Spybey and Dead Voices on Air.\nEKS: Oh, that's excellent. Yeah, I thought Dead Voices were superb, actually.\nJW: Yeah? How long has each of your sets been?\nEKS: Well, um, the actual Pink Dots set tends to be around an hour at the moment - it may extend. But the encores are long, because we've resurrected the \"9 Shades to the Circle,\" and \"Premonition 13,\" yeah.\nJW: Excellent. Yeah, the last time I saw you do those two was in 1995, on that tour.\nEKS: Yeah, I mean, we missed it a lot. And then Martijn rejoined the band it was high time to bring it back. There are certain differences in the Pink Dots -- to start, Marti is playing the violin here or there as well, so it's -- you know -- he's not the virtuoso that Patrick was, but he's actually really very good. There's a lot of odd little twists and turns this time, but we're still working on live versions of the new songs from A Perfect Mystery.\nJW: Yeah, how many tracks are you playing from the brand new album?\nEKS: What was it . . . I think it's 4 or 5, um, it's 5 with a possibility of another 2 that we're still busy with, but they're in their very embryonic stage. So, potentially, you could play a lot, but, um, some things have to pass a certain quality area before we make some public.\nJW: So how about A Perfect Mystery? What are we to expect from the brand new album?\nEKS: Uh . . (chuckles) . . to be honest I think it's the best album we've ever made. And I don't say that lightly. You know, I really feel strange after 27 albums and making such a cliched comment (mockingly), \"and, yeah, but this one's the best!\" But, you know, I honestly believe it this time. I've listened to it quite relentlessly since we finished it, which is rare. You know, normally I have to stay away for a month -- but this one, not -- there's a certain spring in its step. There's a joy in this album.\nJW: Right. Now is, uh, Raymond -- was he working on this album?\nEKS: No, Frank.\nJW: Oh, Frank -- Frank was producing this album again. OK. We have somebody else here in the studio who has a few questions -- Danny? Say hi, Danny.\nEKS: Hullo, Danny.\nDaniel McKernan: Hello, Edward. Can you hear me?\nEKS: Uh huh.\nDM: OK, just making sure. Uh, yeah, I just wanted to ask you about some of your new techniques that you were using on this album -- just, like, you've evolved a lot over the past 27 albums, and just what we should look forward to in the sound in this one?\nEKS: Now, well, there's a lot of live playing on this album. And a lot of processing -- almost three-way processing. In terms of producing, a very live sound in the studio where musicians are playing together and simply committing it straight to tape. You know, you'd have Phil working on sounds that I was making or he was making, and then you'd have Ryan processing the totality of the sound and what you get is a lot of things that never, in fact, could be repeated. And maybe that's why I like it so much: it feels very spontaneous. And, basically, that's what it was. You know, I'd say at least 75-80% of the album has this spontaneous feeling about it. the band wrote it together -- every song, fully, playing a big part in it. And what we have is, actually, I think, quite a different sort of album.\nDM: How long did it take you to record it, overall?\nEKS: Ummm, I think it was two months. It always takes longer than you think it's going to take. But, umm, it was about two months.\nDM: Did Mark Spybey work with you at all on this or what he just, uh, doing his own thing?\nEKS: Oh, yeah, he was busy with his own music during this album. We wanted to, but it just never worked out. Our schedules, you know. In spirit, it would have been perfect, but it just couldn't work out.\nDM: Is he going to be doing anything with you, on stage, with the Pink Dots' set?\nEKS: Ummm, we're talking about that. I don't know that it'll be as early as Boston because we're still working things out ourselves at the moment. When, I think, the set becomes settled and we know exactly what we want to play, because it always changes over the early part of a tour. And there is an idea, indeed, to maybe bring Mark into it as well, you know, for a song or something like that because it would be just a bit of a perfect marriage I think.\nJW: Now let me ask about another project. You have a new Tear Garden album coming out later this year? Now how was that, recording that again?\nEKS: That was a very long distance recording, really, I mean -- there was a lot of jetting back and forth from L.A. to Holland. When it was first finished . . . I wasn't completely sure, but now, I've heard it more, and, actually, it's a bit like Angel Blind. It took a while, but when it got there I actually think it's a nice album, yeah.\nJW: OK. And there are still rumors about that Tear Garden tour . . .\nEKS: Yeah, it should happen. Yeah, November is the plan.\nDM: Will that be throughout the US and other European dates?\nEKS: There's just a handful of European shows planned. The first two are actually about 90% there, in Yena(?), Germany, and Raymond(?), Germany. That's at the beginning of September. And, yeah, the US months is for November. About November the 4th, onwards.\nJW: We also have the brand new solo album from you, Red Letters, which has been getting some great reviews as well, too. How do you decide what songs become Edward Ka-Spel solo songs and what songs become Legendary Pink Dots?\nEKS: Well, Red Letters was a bit of an exception to all the others in that it was recorded over a very short space of time. In the middle of last year -- I was home alone and just plowed in to making a new album, beginning to end. Because normally I'm taking bits and pieces from everywhere over a space of a couple of years and some things wind up as Pink Dots songs and others solo pieces, and there isn't really a . . . hard and fast way of deciding. It depends on how the rest of the band maybe reacts to a piece of mine. But all of these pieces were conceived as solo pieces and executed as solo pieces. And I think the whole thing took maybe three weeks to a month. And it's a very very focused recording -- and album I had to make, really. It very much summed up my feelings during that period.\nJW: It's a different album from a lot of your other things. A lot of new electronic things on there that I'd never heard you use before on your solo project.\nEKS: Uh huh, yeah, there's actually quite a lot of synths in now as well. And I'm busy on another solo album which goes quite far in an experimental direction.\nJW: Is this that ultra-limited LP only thing that's coming out later this year?\nEKS: There is, um, elements of that in that album, but the actual focus is on a new CD -- possibly even a double CD.\nJW: Oh, wow. Well, I don't want to keep you very much longer because I know you have sound check to do. I understand that you guys have a lot, a whole ton, of merchandise this time around. You've got a lot of CD's and a lot of special things with you?\nEKS: Yeah, if it all gets delivered in time, yeah. I mean, is A Perfect Mystery in the stores there yet, by any chance?\nJW: I haven't seen it, no.\nEKS: It wasn't in Toronto last night, and, well, we had forty of them (laughs). They all went.\nJW: How about the Farewell, Milky Way?\nEKS: That should be in Boston. That should be the first show where it's available, if everything goes to plan. You can never quite tell, but if it goes to plan, that will be there.\nDM: I heard that you weren't doing very many old things from your albums. What's the oldest that you go back on this tour?\nEKS: Oh . . . .I think \"Evolution\" might be the oldest song that we're playing this tour. Um, or \"Disturbance\" as well.\nDM: Is it more because you're doing more of the live thing now with all the five members?\nEKS: There's a lot of improvisation. We tend to call upon songs that can develop and change, uh, because that keeps it fresh and alive. To play at song like \"The More It Changes,\" which is a fine song in itself, but play it forty times, and really, you wind up going through the motions or something like that and that's not really what it's about. Just leave it to the CD and enjoy it for what it is there, you know.\nJW: I like the way you sometimes revisit old things and make them new and make them modern in part of the new band. I really like that.\nEKS: Yeah, me too. And we have been working on an arrangement of \"Poppy Day,\" with violin, which I don't know if it will be ready for Boston. We've only tried it once. But it sounded very pleasing when we did it. And so, like, that's something that's wading in the winds -- there are a lot of songs that are wading in the winds at the moment. Hopefully we'll get a chance to pull them together in sound checks. It was unfortunate last night since we were under such pressure that we didn't really get that chance to, you know, stretch ourselves before the show itself, with the equipment turning up late. And the next few nights maybe we do . . . stuff that will happen in the sound checks.\nDM: Also I heard that there's a book coming out, Love and Loud Colors, that's going to be a lot of your prose and poetry. Do you have a lot involved with that or are you mainly just handing things over? And are you writing new material for it or is it going to be a lot of older . . . ?\nEKS: Oh, well, Kirsten, who is making the book -- we're in touch a lot. But I very much leave it in her hands, how she presents it, because I've seen her work and it's really very tasteful, and very good. And I just know it's in good hands.\nJW: So speaking of things in hands and stuff like that, I have a question about the -- it might be a tender subject, if you don't want to talk about it that's OK -- the old Play It Again Sam catalog. Is it coming out soon? Is it going to be released through Soleilmoon or is there anything holding it back?\nEKS: Oh, there's nothing holding it back. The plan is to begin reissuing in the States after the tour. You know, because there is so much around at the moment -- like the new album, and the Farewell, Milky Way album -- and this takes a lot of preparation and a lot of work. And Charles at Soleilmoon likes to take time with each project. A lot of them just rush something out. Which, [taking time] I believe is the right way. Otherwise it becomes a bit of an overload. I mean, it's also all coming out on SPD Poland as well with different covers, and hopefully Polish translations of the lyrics as well. But it all should become available, again. I mean, it needs to be because there are certain albums that are just completely unavailable now for some time. Like The Tower, and . . . .\nJW: And Crushed Velvet Apocalypse, I know people are searching long and hard for that.\nEKS: Yeah, The Golden Age as well -- The Lovers -- I mean, they've all disappeared. So it's, yeah, the will come out again. I'm sure.\nJW: So it's been twenty years since you've started.\nEKS: Almost, yeah.\nJW: Yeah, I mean, what does that feel like -- do you feel as fresh? I mean, it's just an amazing thing to think about. Twenty years, I mean, that's incredible.\nEKS: Oh, it feels great. I mean, I still absolutely love it and enjoy it. And I'm still discovering things, and as long as I'm discovering things, that's what counts, I think. If it was a case of everything intending to sound the same, or if I was repeating myself a little too much without -- I mean, sometimes I repeat myself but it's quite a deliberate ploy. But if I found that I was doing it accidentally, that would really be the time to ask questions. It feels good. The band feels very good at the moment. I'm enjoying this line-up.\nJW: Right. Are there any more future plans for any more Edward Ka-Spel solo sets, or Silverman solo sets, or even Twilight Circus solo sets in the upcoming future?\nEKS: Ummm, I'm leaving that a little bit to, uh, the moment, really. There's a possibility in that last show on San Mon Island that there'll be a Silverman set. Possibly an Edward and Silverman improvisation of special things. That's something I'd like, but then it would be an improvisation. It wouldn't be a solo set of solo songs. It would be, let's see where this takes us -- let's set up and play and find out where we go because that's actually the most glorious feeling of all.\nJW: Alright, well it sounds like people are starting to play the drums behind you.\nEKS: Oh, they've been doing it quite some time.\nDM: What are some of your favorite cities to show up in? To do shows in?\nEKS: Ooooo, ummm . . .\nJW: Remember you're on the radio with Boston right now.\nEKS: (Laughing) Oh, Boston, absolutely, yeah . . .\nDM: (Laughing) And I'm from New Orleans.\nEKS: Oh, and New Orleans, yeah. Actually I do like New Orleans, wonderful. Actually I do; I am fond of that place. Umm, Austin. I always like playing in Austin. Umm, I think Denver, Seattle . . .\nDM: Do you find that the crowd is a little bit different here than in Europe?\nEKS: Yeah, well, you can't really say Europe, really, because within Europe each country is so remarkably different from another. I mean, I love playing in a country like Poland, in Europe -- it's just, the thrill . . . The people are great.\nJW: Yeah, you guys are pop stars in Poland.\nEKS: Oh, we aren't pop stars but we have a very dedicated following that seems to understand us very very well there. We just connect somehow with Poland.\nJW: Do you think that any of your international success over the last few years has been in part due to all the people connecting on the various mailing lists and the newsgroups and the websites and all those things?\nEKS: Absolutely. Beyond any measure of a doubt. You know, we've noticed our popularity go up in places like England. Quite markedly. And it's not to do with any type of publicity in England, it's to do with basically more and more people getting online there. In fact our London shows last year were the best shows of the year.\nJW: That's pretty strange because you haven't played London in a long time. A very tough crowd.\nEKS: They were marvelous. It was so emotional. We could have played forever in front of these people. It was just so . . uh . . I almost cried, especially at that first London show. It was like . . . coming home.\nJW: Are there other places that have been traditionally very difficult to play that you've found to be absolutely amazing now or maybe were great before and just have sort of changed or something -- any big changes in places?\nEKS: Paris isn't what it was. I mean, still a big crowd comes along but it's just not what it was. Brussels is excellent. The odd little Dutch show that we played, which, I mean, even playing once or twice in Holland, I used to really dislike it because we'd have this rather bored audience that just wouldn't even notice you. They'd just be talking about, uh, what they bought in the supermarket during the week. That's changed now, to, actually, a very supportive audience. Uh, some places just always are great: Prague, that's another city that -- I don't know, we mean something there. A lot of people turn out and they get so much behind it.\nJW: Well it's a great experience, I mean you're very personal . . . .\n[CLICK -- Here's where Edward's calling card runs out.]\nJW: I think we lost him. Did we loose him? OK, well it looks like we've lost contact. Umm, the phone is cut dead. His calling card probably ran out. We'll see if we can get him back on, if not, well, then I guess that would be it for the interview.", "id": "<urn:uuid:6132d9a3-ac6a-4478-b242-aa9e0685f076>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/publications/lpd-2000-wzbc.php?site=lpd08", "date": "2013-05-18T06:32:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9830995202064514, "token_count": 4120, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Friday, July 27, 2012\nPetra Anderson is a name landing in headlines as the young woman appears to be making an amazing full recovery after being shot multiple times during the Aurora, Colorado shooting.\nAnderson, age 22, was at the midnight premiere of \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" when James Holmes opened fire, shooting the aspiring music professor four times in the crowded theater, the Associated Press reports.\nThree shotgun pellets hit Anderson's arm and another went through her nose, riding up the back of her cranium and hitting the back of her skull.\n\"Her injuries were severe, and her condition was critical…The doctors prior to surgery were concerned because so much of the brain had been traversed by the bullet,\" Anderson's pastor, Brad Strait, wrote in his blog.\nStrait, who was in the hospital during the young woman's surgery, added that doctors were worried that Anderson's injuries could impair her speech, motor and cognitive abilities.\nBut incredibly, during the five-hour surgery, doctors soon found that Anderson's brain sustained very little damage and the pellet was removed cleanly.\nAccording to Strait, Anderson was saved by a miracle birth \"defect\" that no one could have anticipated.\nThe doctor explains that Petra’s brain has had from birth a small “defect” in it. It is a tiny channel of fluid running through her skull…Only a CAT scan would catch it, and Petra would have never noticed it.But in Petra’s case, the shotgun buck shot…enters her brain from the exact point of this defect. Like a marble through a small tube, the defect channels the bullet from Petra’s nose through her brain. It turns slightly several times, and comes to rest at the rear of her brain. And in the process, the bullet misses all the vital areas of the brain.\nAnderson has already started to speak and walk again -- is expected to make a full recovery.\n\"She could have lost all kinds of function (if) the bullet traversed her brain,\" her mother Kim Anderson told the Sacramento Bee. \"I believe that she was not only protected by God, but that she was actually prepared for it.\"\nTo support the young woman and her family, the Hope Rises Relief Fund has started a campaign for the Andersons. So far, more than $32,000 has been raised.\nAnderson's injury has come at a difficult time for the young woman's family. Her mother is battling terminal breast cancer and the cost of medical bills for both women has proven to be a daunting challenge.\n“If the pellet had wavered a millimeter, really in any direction from what it actually took, then she would have likely either died or been severely injured,” said Dr. Michael Rauzzino, a neurosurgeon at The Medical Center of Aurora who operated on Anderson to remove the pellet. “I would say this is definitely a miracle,” he said, while showing an MRI of Anderson’s brain.\nThe MRI reveals a faint trace of the pellet’s path after it entered the left side of Petra's nose, broke through the front", "id": "<urn:uuid:5fd01ae4-2dfc-4392-b594-85449e45e851>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://brandon7221.blogspot.com/2012_07_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:00:40Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9844777584075928, "token_count": 654, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "I’m really not a vain person, I promise, but yes I am going to post a picture of my new haircut. This blog isn’t supposed to be about me and my hair, my clothes, etc but I am so happy with it and the way it makes me feel, I couldn’t help but want to share it with you haha. I was really sick of how my hair looked before; dry, dead, straight and poofy. It looked awful even though it was hard to get it to go that way. I have naturally wavy hair but my hair was so heavy, thick and yuck, that it wasn’t really waving. I found a picture on a website of a really nice, layered hair cut with BANGS *plays creepy music* I haven’t had bangs since I was 10 and I looked absolutely horrible with them then. I was definitely nervous.\nI thought I would take a really, really big chance and hand the printed off photo to the hairstylist and hold my breath. Honestly, I had no idea how it would come out. It took me thirty minutes to find the photo and voila, I liked it so I went for it. I am really very happy with the outcome, thank goodness. I don’t have to do anything but wash my hair and it naturally does what it does. I don’t even have to brush it now, yay! Before I had to constantly brush my yuck poof-hair to make it poof. Now, I do nothing and it looks really nice. I actually look like I’m 19, I look put together and ‘clean’. So anyway, I just wanted to share with you that little happy rant and a picture of my new haircut. I’m so glad it came out as well as it did.

{"text": "I've had this book on my reading list for a couple of years and finally got to it. I've never read anything but good about it, but actually struggled at about 100 pages over whether or not I wanted to finish it. There are a lot of characters, all with Russian and Czech names, and the author makes the assumption that you know something about what happened in Siberia in the first World War. I thought that I would probably give it a not-so-good review.\nBut now that I've finished, I have to say that I liked the book and I'm glad I read it. I wish I had read it at a time when I could really dedicate some time to sorting out all the characters and maybe looking into some background information about what happened in this time period in Siberia. Most of my negative reactions are probably my own fault.\nStill, combine a freaky religious sect (apparently based on the truth) with a squadron of Czech soldiers.. lay on top of that the town widow and her son who have past connections with certain characters in the town.

{"text": "We’ve just finished our half-term break, and for various random reasons I spent the week North of the Watford Gap, an exhilarating experience for a southerner.\nDue praise, before anything else, to the Victorian engineers and railway men whose vision and graft allowed me to travel from London to Elgin (near Inverness) on – in effect – an unbroken piece of track, via Lancaster, Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh, Leuchars (for St Andrews), Dundee and Aberdeen.\nYou could tell I was in that trainspotter’s twilight zone by the wad of rail tickets stuffed into my wallet. There was a magic moment in Lancaster when I was sorting through them to find the time of the next train to Manchester, and one of my friends who would be on the ‘danger zone’ end of the geekiness scale when it comes to all things public transport couldn’t resist swanning up beside me to note how many journeys I had timetabled for one holiday trip. I impressed myself that I managed to impress him.\nAnyway, it wasn’t for love of trains that I set off, but – more or less – for love of the faith. Last Saturday, as I wrote about earlier, was the ordination of John Millar, one of our seminarians, at Lancaster Cathedral; with a great crowd of friends, family, parishioners, priests and fellow seminarians.\nThat afternoon I got to Leeds, via Manchester, for the evening event of the ‘Love@Leeds’ Youth 2000 retreat for young adults. It was the first time a Youth 2000 retreat had been held in the city, and by all accounts it was a huge success. Notre Dame Catholic Sixth Form College proved to be a great venue. The school hall provided a dignified place for the worship and services (the chapel would have been far too small), and the dining room was a place not just to eat but to socialise and talk the night away.\nFor the Reconciliation Service (with individual confessions) and Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament that evening there were over 200 young people there, mainly of university age; and I’d guess that a good 150 stayed over for the talks and Mass the following day.\nAfter a couple of days to myself in Edinburgh (I’d never been before) I went to St Andrews as a guest of the Catholic Chaplaincy. I did all the touristy stuff, and went down on one knee to pat the 18th green (it’s all public). I’m not big into golf, but I wanted to experience the moment and have something to tell my golfing friends.\nIt was great to be in the chaplaincy there, and to meet the students and Fr Andrew the chaplain and parish priest. It has been a powerhouse for vocations over the years, as well as being just a friendly and solid formative environment for young Catholics; and I have known many priests who studied at St Andrews and identify it as the place where their vocation really crystallised.\nMy talk was entitled, ‘Is there a difference between human happiness and Christian joy?’ I’ll try to post about my reflections sometime soon.\nThen, after a huge cooked breakfast in my B&B, I got the train to Aberdeen, had time for a brief look at the Catholic Cathedral, where Abbot Hugh Gilbert has recently been installed as bishop; and ended my journey at Pluscarden Abbey, where Bishop Hugh was from, to catch up with two old friends who are now ‘juniors’ in the monastery. It was my first visit, and I want to post about that later as well, to give it some proper space on the blog.\nSo that’s my week! Praise to the rail network, which was cheap, and mostly on time. And praise, above all, to the vitality of Catholic life in this country – which is the main reason for posting. An ordination of a man in his young twenties in Lancaster, giving his life to the Lord and to the service of God’s people. A powerful retreat for university students in the heart of Leeds, who chose to be there to deepen their faith when there are so many other pulls on their time and attention. A Catholic chaplaincy, forming its students, sustaining them, as it has done for many years. And a thriving Benedictine monastery in a place of breathtaking beauty that is simply doing what it has always done, and for that reason attracting young men to join it.\nThank God for these wonderful signs of faith in Britain!", "id": "<urn:uuid:88f116ac-8845-4d72-b04a-dc6819faa48c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bridgesandtangents.wordpress.com/tag/st-andrews-catholic-chaplaincy/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:12:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9789693355560303, "token_count": 958, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Listen to the podcast. Find it on iTunes/iPod and Podcast.com. Download the transcript. Sponsor: The Open Group.\nDana Gardner: Hi, this is Dana Gardner, Principal Analyst at Interarbor Solutions, and you're listening to BriefingsDirect. Today, we present a sponsored podcast discussion, coming to you from The Open Group Conference last week in Boston.\nWe've assembled a panel to explore a new military aircraft systems interoperability consortium and effort, the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE), which aims to promote and better support interoperability and standardization among future military avionics platforms across several branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.\nWe will define FACE, how it came about, and examine the consortium's basic goals under the tutelage of The Open Group.\nHere to help better understand the promise and potential for FACE to improve costs, spur upgrades, flexibility, and accelerate the components' development agility is our panel. We are here with David Lounsbury, Vice President for Collaboration Services at The Open Group. Welcome.\nDavid Lounsbury: Hi, Dana. How are you?\nGardner: I'm great. We're also here with Mike Williamson, Deputy Program Manager for Mission Systems with the Navy's Air Combat Electronics Program Office. Welcome to the show.\nMike Williamson: Dana, thanks, it’s good to be here.\nGardner: Mike, tell us a little bit about what FACE is, and the history that led up to it?\nWilliamson: Sometimes it’s easier to describe a program by saying what it’s not. FACE is not a program. FACE is not a computer. FACE is not a software package. FACE is an environment, and it’s specifically set up as an environment. It was an idea that came about to try to reduce costs, improve interoperability across naval aircraft, and to get capabilities out to the fleet faster and quicker, as best we can.\nFACE started out as a Navy program. As we started looking around to see what other services were doing, we found that the Army and the Air Force were also doing similar things and trying to go down that same path.\nThe Army had a program called Integrated Data Modem (IDM). The Air Force was doing a program called Universal Network Interface (UNI). We got together with them and are now teaming up to put this consortium together and go forward to define standards for what FACE will be.\nGardner: In general terms, what are the problems that we need to solve here?\nWilliamson: The primary problems are cost and schedule. The costs of getting systems to the fleet today are going up. Primarily, it's driven by testing and by the fact that the systems that we have on aircraft today are not open.\nAs for schedule, it takes a minimum of two years, once a new capability is defined, to get it fielded on our aircraft today. We need to reduce that timeline.\nGardner: For the benefit of our listeners, we're talking about the avionic systems. Can you tell us a little bit more about the actual systems and some of the capabilities that we're addressing with this program?\nWilliamson: We're really addressing all of the capabilities and all of the systems onboard the aircraft. In the past, we identified a requirement and usually developed a system to meet that requirement.\nWhat we are trying to do with FACE now is to develop a computer environment that’s on the aircraft already. As we define new capabilities and new things that we want to put out into the fleet, we can host software in the computer environment that’s already there, rather than building a brand new box, software, or program for every single capability that we put out there.\nGardner: Dave, I think The Open Group has seen this issue before, right?\nLounsbury: Yeah. It’s very interesting. We've got a number of activities that are on this government-industry boundary, where some of the lessons that industry learned about how open standards can bring agility and help control your cost can benefit military systems like this.\nI want to pick up on a thread that you mentioned about schedule, because there’s two sides to that coin. The testing and deployment schedule is a real issue for agility for our forces. The one thing we know is that threats change all of the time, and we need the ability to field new capabilities quickly, both as the mission changes and also as the technology evolves.\nWe really need that modularity within the necessary structures of testing for things that are going to be used, and be able to get those new capabilities in the cycle quickly and get them out to the war fighters.\nGardner: So how did The Open Group become involved, and what do you expect to be doing vis-à-vis the FACE effort?\nLounsbury: The Open Group has a couple of areas similar to this. We've got our Real-time and Embedded Systems Forum for some of the fundamental standards.\nWe've been running a consortium called DirectNet, which is very similar to FACE in the sense that it is principally focused on a defense need, but in the context of open systems. Through connections developed there, Mike found us and we talked about what we can do to organize.\nTypically, what The Open Group does is provide a structure. Members come in, they bring their business expertise, their subject matter expertise, and operate. What we provide is the framework, where we can have an open consortium that has a balance of interest between the suppliers of components, all government agency programs doing procurement, and the integrators who put it all together. We've got the proven process at The Open Group to make sure that we have that openness that's important for protecting all of the parties.\nGardner: Mike, tell me about milestones and timelines? How far into this effort are we, and what might the fruits of this labor be over time?\nWilliamson: This idea really started about a year ago in the Navy, within PMA-209, the program office that I represent here, the Combat Electronics Program Office, at the Naval Air Systems Command. We started looking at what we could do and what we needed to do.\nThe timeline is very, very tight. We're looking at having some kind of standards defined by first quarter of calendar year 2011 -- next year. By the end of March, we're looking to have defined a set of standards on what the FACE environment will look like, because we have procurements coming out at that time that we intend to have FACE be part of those requests for proposals (RFPs) that are going to be coming out.\nGardner: And for you, Dave, at The Open Group, what do you see as some of the existing efforts that have taken place that you could look to for some guidance? Are there processes, standards, or technologies that will already be available for FACE?\nLounsbury: It's very early, and we're just starting to learn the technical requirements. There are a few that we know that we are going to need. We've talked about the need for operating system kernels that keep the various levels of information to various levels of sensitivity separate. And, there's an active program in our Real-time and Embedded Systems Forum called MILS that's addressing that. I think there will be many that we will discover going forward.\nThere is also a good background. The Open Group has worked with some other government activities -- the Modular Open Systems Architecture folk. We've got quite a reservoir of expertise there. What we're going to be doing principally is marshaling, as always, the expertise of the members to address various parts of the problem.\nGardner: Let's look to some commonality, Mike, between the commercial world and the efforts for your avionics platforms, this notion of modular and the right balance between components, silos, and an overarching system. Tell us where you expect this to go, not only in terms of your agility, but into better architecture.\nWilliamson: One of the things that we have looked at is the fact that commercial industry is doing this. Commercial aviation is already doing a lot of this. We've not been able to do that within naval aviation to date, and primarily that's been driven by safety-of-flight issues, issues within our operability, and issues with how we contract for things. We need to get beyond that.\nWe're actually using the model of what commercial aviation has done, with open systems, open source software, licensed software, and those kinds of things, to ask how we can bring that into our platforms. We need to have an environment that we can have a library of software applications that can be used across multiple platforms in the same environment.\nThat solves two problems for us. One, it gets capabilities to the fleet cheaper and faster. And two, it solves the interoperability issues that we have today, where even sometimes when we have the same standards, two different platforms implement the same standards in two different ways and they can't talk to each other. They are not interoperable. Those are the things that we are trying to solve with this.\nLounsbury: I want to pick up on something you mentioned there about following the commercial world, and you articulated a few business drivers in there, like cost, time to market, and things like that. One of the explicit goals of FACE, and we performed a business work group to address these, is to talk about the business-model issues. What does open licensing mean in a government context? What would be appropriate ways of sharing intellectual property rights (IPR) in the run up to this?\nThese are all things that commercial people are familiar with through years of standards activity, but it's kind of new to some of the players in the government space. So, we're going to make sure that those things are explicitly addressed. It’s not just the technological solution, though that’s the critical part, but the fact that people can actually buy -- and that we will have a marketplace of -- components that can be licensed and reused.\nIt's early on how we are going to do that, but it’s a very active topic inside the consortium.\nGardner: Do you see an extensibility that this effort with FACE might have some bearing on where you could go in other areas of either the military or government?\nLounsbury: Certainly. Obviously, we started FACE. The Navy came to The Open Group, but once the word got out, the Army and Air Force are on board. So, we've started to branch out into agencies.\nThe government is a complex place, and there are lot of programs, so principal growth will be different programs inside the government. But, we do envision that some of the things that will be developed here may be applicable to other systems. Part of the vision is, in fact, how does this start to overlap with the commercial avionics practice that Mike mentioned earlier.\nGardner: And, we've got our timeline. We understand that there are going to be some improvements pretty rapidly. Is there anything about the standardization process, Mike, that is perhaps different than you expected? Is there any learning process so far?\nWilliamson: There have been a lot of things that I've learned, having The Open Group come along and take a lead on all of this and developing the standards. The Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD) aren't real good at developing standards ourselves. We've tried to do it in the past and we've failed miserably with some of the attempts that we have had. Having The Open Group come and join us, and then bringing industry in, was the right thing to do.\nHaving this consortium with industry, Navy, Army, and Air Force acquisition teams, and fleet participation, has been the right way to go. It’s the only way we can really define the standards and get in place the standards that we really need to get at, with all those inputs coming together.\nGardner: We've been discussing a new military aircraft systems interoperability effort and consortium, the Future Airborne Capability Environment or FACE effort, and how it promises to improve costs, spur upgrades, flexibility, and accelerate avionics components' development agility.\nI'd like to thank our guests. We've been joined by David Lounsbury, Vice President of Collaboration Services at The Open Group.

{"text": "While I quit WOW awhile ago I still find it necessary to come out swinging to defend it from its many detractors now and again. I just saw a video bashing WOW for ruining MMOs entirely and while the video was amusing and made some good points I think there was far too much silly misinformation there. There are lots of things people criticize about WOW legitimately but here are some of the more common but incorrect ones:\nHotbar Based Combat\nHotbar based combat has two primarily components. First we have the mechanic that hitting a button does something. You hit R and your character casts Divine Shield. You hit 2 and your character casts Judgement. This is NOT a WOW mechanic, it is a 'using a computer' mechanic. The second component of hotbar based combat is having these linkages between keystrokes and game actions represented on the screen for player reference. Is anyone really upset that there is a small corner of the screen devoted to letting me know which buttons do which things, or are they upset because hitting buttons does things? Either answer is ridiculous.\nQuests and Quest Hubs\nSaying that WOW quests suck and aren't interesting is fair. Most of them are 'Kill 10 Rats' or some variation on that theme. However, we aren't comparing WOW quests to some undefined game nirvana but rather to other realistic options. WOW tried in depth quests with tons of story, cinematics, phasing, etc. to make quests less about killing rats and more about saving the world in Cataclysm and guess what... they sucked worse. How about removing quests entirely? Then you get endless hours grinding the same mobs over and over, which was a constant complaint about the games before WOW, and also about WOW at launch. People want quests, they don't want quests that are too cinematic / interesting / hard, and they want to be able to easily find those quests. Oh look, we are back to 'Kill 10 Rats'.\nPlayer Freedom aka The Sandbox\nPeople talk about wanting extremely freedom to build their own world - the sandbox experience. The trouble is what they actually want is freedom for themselves and no freedom for other people. Note what happens in Eve, the flagship of sandbox games: People nearly all hide in perfectly safe places doing missions and mining that barely ever interact with other players and build nothing of consequence except a bankroll. When they aren't being boring and they go out into the dangerous part of the world they get scammed, PKed, and their stuff gets stolen or destroyed for lols.\nDo you know what happens in a sandbox where there aren't any adults protecting the kids from each other? Bullies run around smashing everybody's castles to bits just for fun. Imagine if WOW let people build things. The first thing they would build is giant walls to block off the newb areas so new players couldn't escape. Then they would wall off class trainers, blockade cities, and do all manner of other disruptive things. That is, of course, unless player built things could be destroyed in which case everything that was built would be torn down by others in a fit of spite. Sandbox type gameplay combined with Massively Multiplayer results in endless griefing and (surprise!) no subscribers.\nAn Ill Defined Paradise\nMy challenge to all those who claim WOW ruined everything is this: Come up with better alternatives. Precise alternatives. Not \"I would do things better.\" because that is just mental masturbation with a hubris sauce. You don't like quests? Cool, tell me how exactly you would run things. It is nearly certain that your solution would be either completely impractical or straight up worse. (Worse for the majority, of course, since you can find a couple of people who will sign on to any damn fool thing.) Is WOW perfect? HELL no. However, the claim that WOW ruined everything is spurious at best. Games copied WOW because of its financial success and failed because they did it worse. The reason so many games that are kinda like WOW get made and so many other games don't get made is because investors want to get paid and WOW clones, sad as it seems, are more likely to make money than MMOs that try something completely different.", "id": "<urn:uuid:3165695b-1379-42a0-bbe5-9d32eaf82d07>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://brightcapegamer.blogspot.com/2013/02/wow-ruined-everything.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:13:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9745855331420898, "token_count": 869, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

What particular virtue,\nthis good lady had, I do not know, but certain it is, she was much\nvisited by the populace, who left many gifts in their wills, to dress,\npaint, and repair her; at the coming of Edw. VI. to the crown, she\nwas dismounted, and I am apt to believe the poor oak, also cut down,\nleast that should be visited for her ladyship's sake, for the present oak,\nwhich now grows in the place, hath not been planted a hundred\nyears, as appears by the parish register in these words, \"I John\nTabor, constable and overseer, did bring the Oak from Rannerhall near Horning ferry, before me on my horse, and set it in the\nchurchyard of St. Martin of Coselany, I set it March 9. 1656.\"\nThen also the rich vestments and plate, were sold, and the money laid\nout to fye the river.

The tithes of Basset's\nclose, and a third part of the tithes of that part of Gilden-croft, lying\nwithin the bounds of this parish, were due to the rector here and the\nmortuary was the best beast; it seems to have been appropriated by\nBishop Blundeville, with the consent of Ric. de Redham, the last\nrector, who had a grant of it for life, paying 10s. per annum to the infirmary, which was confirmed by the Bishop and the Pope. And\nfrom that time, it hath been a perpetual curacy or donative, and is\nnow in the donation of the dean and chapter of Norwich. It was\nreturned formerly into the Exchequer, to be \"an appropriation of\nthe dean and chapter, the curate's stipend being 20 marks;\" but now\nthe curate hath only the income of the estate purchased with the\naugmentation money, and the surplice fees and voluntary contributions, amounting in the whole to about 40l. per annum.\nIn 1460, Sir John Feltwell was parish chaplain. 1492, Sir\nThomas Cawne, alias Plowman, D.

In Edward the Third's\ntime, Sir Robert de Benhale, Knt. held the 3d part of the mills and\nmanor of Horsford, in right of the lady Eve, daughter of Eve de\nClavering, his then wife. (fn. 10) In 1394, the tithes of this mill were paid\nto the keeper of the Infirmary, in right of the appropriated rectory\nof St. Martin. In 1518, Lord D'acres, lord of Horsford, owned it,\nand was then seized of the fishery belonging to the mill, which was\nthen set out by them and the corporation, and it extended from the\nmill to the bank of the close late of Rob. Thorp; before that of Gregory Clerk, after of Edm. Clerk, and late of Hamond Linsted; and\nin 1539, the lord of Horsford granted that fishery to be held of his\nmanor of Horsford, to Alderman Nic.

At the Dissolution, the advowson of the rectory, and all the\ngreat garden and house, were granted to Thomas Duke of Norfolk and\nhis heirs, from which time it hath been a donative, and it is now in\nthe donation of the Lord Townesend.

{"text": "easyDCP allows for easy generation and play-out of digital cinema packages and offers a high quality, cost-effect way to create a variety of distribution formats\nLas Vegas – April 16, 2012 (Booth #C8444)- Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, the world’s renowned source for audio and multimedia technologies, announces today its partnership with Digital Film Technology (DFT), the supplier of professional solutions for postproduction, motion picture and TV industries. The new partnership integrates Fraunhofer IIS’s easyDCP into DFT’s FLEXXITY workflow, providing a more cost-effective way to create digital cinema packages (DCP) as a master format.\nThough notoriously expensive to create, DCPs are highly regarded as the best replacement for film reels due to its high quality and ability to create a wide variety of distribution formats. DFT chose Fraunhofer IIS’s easyDCP due to its software-base that does not require costly additional hardware. In addition, the organization’s easyDCP cinema packages are compliant with the latest standards and can be used with all DCI-compliant cinema server systems. The solution also enables DCPs to be created and used for theater play-out and master format for the creation of further distribution formats through FLEXXITY, such as H.264.\nFraunhofer IIS scientists extended the functionalities of its easyDCP technology to enable the integration into host applications, for easy generation and play-out of digital cinema packages (DCP) in real time.\n”With DFT we have gained a globally renowned partner who recognizes and relies on our expertise to enhance its products”, explains Heiko Sparenberg, head of the digital cinema group. “In order to integrate our software, core functionalities were bundled and extended to provide access for external systems. This required developing a new library to enable communication between our easyDCP and DFT’s FLEXXITY system.”\nWith more than 20 years of experience, Fraunhofer IIS is a trusted expert in digital cinema standardization and creation development. More than 500 customers already use its easyDCP software package worldwide, including the 2012 Berlinale International Film Festival, that relied on IIS software developments to support the technical quality control of all submissions.\nFraunhofer IIS will present its easyDCP software developments as well as camera and data compression developments at NAB 2012, booth #C8444. DFT will also showcase the integrated easyDCP software in the FLEXXITY workflow at C11145.\nFor more information, please visit www.iis.fraunhofer.de.\nAbout Fraunhofer IIS\nFounded in 1985 the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS in Erlangen, today with more than 750 staff members, ranks first among the Fraunhofer Institutes concerning headcount and revenues.

{"text": "My pal Jamie sings and plays bass in The Moanin Dove. He also plays bass in almost every other good band in San Francisco. And I don’t mean just wimpy regular bass that anyone can play (I can’t), but the super-manly upright bass. That’s basically (BASSically!) the largest instrument you can play. Ok, fine, really that would be the Great Stalacpipe Organ in Virginia, but the upright bass is the biggest “I’m in a cool band” instrument you can play, so it’s still pretty impressive. It’s even impressive when Jamie plays the wussy normal bass. Basssssssssssss.\nThe Moanin Dove is having their record release show this Thursday, July 7th, at Bottom of the Hill. I caught up with Jamie to talk SF, music, movies, the golden era of 1985, and, as usual, money money money.\nMy name is James Riotto and I play bass and sing in The Moanin Dove.\nDescribe your sound in five words (or less).\nElectric swamp lounge music.\nTell us about your band name.\nWe stole our name from one of our favorite bars in rural Western MA. We were on our way to California and we still didn’t have a name, so we settled on that cause we figured no one would realize where it came from. I guess I just let the proverbial cat out of the bag.\nFavorite thing about San Francisco?\nThis city is so amazing! The incredible food is definitely at the top of the list. Also the fact that I can go ten miles in any direction and find some amazing hiking. Oh, and Golden Gate Park.\nFavorite SF restaurant?\nShalomar, El Metate.\nFavorite SF bar?\nI truly love beer, but I don’t often go out to bars at this point. I’d rather get a bottle of Lagunitas IPA and hang in Alamo Square Park with some friends.\nHow do you prepare for a big show? What will you be doing the night before?\nI usually have one last rehearsal so we can run through the whole set and work out any kinks. Then I go home and read.\nWhat can people expect at your shows?\nIt’s pretty important to me that our shows are different every time. We work with so many amazing musicians in other projects, so there are often guests sharing the stage with us. Also, we all come from a kind of free improvisation background, so we definitely like to stretch out a bit when we perform live.\nWhat do you do during downtime on tour?\nEvery time I leave for tour, I tell myself that I am going to be productive with all the down time on the road. I always start really well, but at a certain point I realize that it’s just more fun to hang out and act like a 15 year old with my bandmates than it is to write music or practice. I do try to read a lot, for sure.\nWhat’s next for the band? (i.e. plug your next show!)\nWe actually have our EP release show coming up at Bottom of the Hill on July 7th. I set up a really amazing bill with Beep! and Audio Out Send supporting us, and I’m super excited about it. We’ll be releasing our brand new EP, Broken Light Parade. Also, we’re backing up our friend, Mohsen Namjoo, at Herbst Theater on July 1st. He is an absolutely incredible musician from Iran, and we’re stoked to play another show with him. We’ll be making a record together in October.\nThree things you’d take to a desert island?\nI’m gonna have to pass on this. I just can’t ever imagine myself being stranded on a desert island. I mean, I know that’s not the point of your question, but I’ve just got nothing here.\nWhat movie can you watch over and over and never get sick of?\nBack to the Future, Spaceballs, Indiana Jones. I think I’m stuck in 1985.\nFavorite season or time of year (and why)?\nAutumn in New England is incredible. I’ll never stop missing it.\nThree things that are in your fridge right now?\nEggs, Almond Milk, Strawberries. I pretty much eat breakfast food whenever possible.\nAnything in your sock drawer besides socks?\nI have a pair of new shoelaces that have been in my drawer for about five years. I’m never going to use them, but I just can’t bring myself to get rid of them.\nNow let’s get down to the nitty gritty, i.e. money:\nIt’s very difficult to be a musician in San Francisco. I work as a recording engineer at Tiny Telephone, and I also play as a session musician on a lot of other people’s records. I’m just getting to a point where I can live a very modest life doing what I love. I guess I’m just going to keep that ball rolling for as long as I can.\nHave any tips for aspiring musicians trying to make it on their craft?\nThe only thing you can do is work ridiculously hard. I’m still trying to figure it out. I’ll let you know the secret once I’ve learned it myself!\nBest money saving tip in general?\nWhere do you live now and what are some good cheap/fun things to do in that area?\nI live right around the corner from the Full House house on Alamo Square Park. I think the best thing to do is hang out in Golden Gate Park. It’s so huge, and there’s just so much to explore there.\nWhat do you refuse to spend money on?\nSex. I’ll spend it on the pursuit of sex, but not on sex itself. I hope that makes sense.\nWhat is the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought and how did that feel?\nMy upright bass. It’s a hundred year old Bohemian bass and it’s really beautiful. I’m so glad that I bought it.\nWhat’s the best deal you’ve ever gotten?\n$1.50 tacos at Vallarta. You just can’t beat that.\nWhat is your favorite free thing to do?\nHiking. I’ll never tire of the incredible hiking in the Bay Area.\nIf you woke up a millionaire, what’s the first thing you’d buy?\nThe homemade corned beef hash at Aunt Mary’s Cafe in Oakland. Seriously, it’s that good.\nWhat’s one GOOD thing about not having a ton of money?\nNone of my friends have a ton of money, and there’s a certain amount of camaraderie to that. We’re all in this together.\nAny last words?\nPlease come out to the Bottom of the Hill on July 7th! It’s going to be a really special show.\n*photos by Joshua Uziel, via Facebook", "id": "<urn:uuid:5d4d6c62-9d80-49bd-a90d-31bbfa0ade59>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://brokeassstuart.com/blog/2011/07/04/broke-ass-band-interview-the-moanin-dove-thurs-bottom-of-the-hill/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:58:59Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9441671967506409, "token_count": 1548, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Juniors Pascal Denis (Magog, QUE) and Shane Mudryk (Leduc, ALB) took two quick shots on Walsh but the rebound kicked out to Burke on the left point.

{"text": "Red Sox remembrances of 9/11\nIt is a day none of us will ever forget. Here is what the Red Sox remember.\nThe Red Sox were in New York getting ready to face Roger Clemens the night of 9/10, but that game was rained out, enabling the team to fly to Tampa a little earlier than planned for their series that was scheduled to begin in St. Petersburg — ironically where the Sox are right now — on 9/11/01.\nKnuckleballer Tim Wakefield:\n“[My girlfriend and now wife Stacy] was actually in New York with me. She got out because we got rained out. She got the last flight out and beat me [to Tampa] so when we got in at 4 in the morning, she was already sleeping. She was up when all this was taking place and woke me up and said, ‘hey, you need to wake up.’ I started watching it and like 10 minutes later, we saw the second plane hit and we were like, ‘oh god, something bad is happening right now.”’\n“To watch stuff on television now, the documentaries about how everything unfolded and how whoever was in charge of grounding all the airplanes made the hardest, right decision anyone could have made. Knowing it would costs the airlines millions and millions of dollars if they stopped all flights immediately, they’d have to ground the planes and all the passengers would have to switch flights. That’s when they found out about United 93. The game was meaningless [compared to what was going on] but we needed to get back playing.”\nWakefield on Ground Zero: “In 2002, I drove by. I took a cab and jus drove by. I didn’t want to get out. in ’05, we went and opened the stock market, me, trot and somebody else, we rang the bell at the American Stock Exchange. We went to somebody’s office that overlooked Ground Zero. He was part of that whole thing. He kept telling us how the building was shaking and all that stuff. The chaos.”\nJason Varitek was out for the remainder of 2001 with a fractured right elbow.\n“Actually I didn’t arrive in Tampa. I was on the DL, I was in rehab. I actually arrived that morning to rehab when it all happened. It’s like, once you realize what happened, everybody dropped what they were doing and took off and left.”\n“There’s a heightened awareness to everything that goes on around you for one. Appreciation for the people that tried to save lives and to do those things and you reach out to those people who have lost family, friends, etc., in the most tragic thing that’s ever happened here.”\nJacoby Ellsbury, now an All-Star and an MVP candidate, turned 18 years old on Sept. 11, 2001. He was a junior at Madras (Oregon) High School.\n“I just remember going to school and waking up that morning and hearing something happened. At school, we turned on all the TV’s and saw everything unfold. At the beginning, I don’t think anyone really knew what was going on. But yeah, I just remember watching things unfold from Madras (ore.) High. I was on my way to school when I kind of heard everything. It’s hard to believe it’s been 10 years.”\nThe 2001 season was basically the only year of Terry Francona’s youth or adult life that he wasn’t wearing a baseball uniform. Francona was a scout for the Indians in 2001, and was on assignment in Pittsburgh when the terrorist attacks happened. His best friend Brad Mills was also scouting for the Cubs at that time, and was in Pittsburgh, at the same hotel as Francona when everything happened.\n“I was in Pittsburgh scouting and coincidentally Millsy was scouting for the Cubs. He was advancing. He was upstairs in the concierge room because he never pays for coffee. So he called me and he was like, ‘hey, you need to come up here, man. I went upstairs and I sat there with him. Kind of watched it and then rented a car and drove back to Philly because obviously there weren’t going to be games. I remember driving by Shanksville (Pennsylvania) on the turnpike. The exit was closed. I remember being glad I was with Millsy. Times like that, it’s nice to have maybe your best friend in the whole world with you.”\nFrancona is glad that soldiers can take some enjoyment out of being around baseball: “I hope it does. If you like baseball, I don’t know that it matters what you do. obviously I hope what we do, people get enjoyment out of it. I think it’s cool that they bring soldiers and people like that around and they honor them at the ballparks. I think everybody enjoys that. I think it’s a really neat thing. If they get some enjoyment out of what we’re doing, that’s terrific.”\nOf course, perhaps nobody affiliated with the Red Sox had a more compelling 9/11 story than Trot Nixon, whose wife Kathryn gave birth to the couple’s first son on 9/11/01.

{"text": "By Patrick J. Buchanan\n“In May 1866, a little group of young men in the Tennessee village of Pulaski, finding their time hang heavily on their hands after the excitement of the field, so lately abandoned, formed a secret club for the mere pleasure of association, for private amusement — for anything that might break the monotony of the too quiet place, as their wits might work upon the matter, and one of their number suggested that they call themselves the Kuklos, the Circle.”\nThis prettified depiction of the founding of the Ku Klux Klan is from “A History of the American People” by Princeton professor and future President Woodrow Wilson.\nThe main activities of the Klan, wrote Wilson, were “pranks,” “mischief” and “frolicking.” Occasionally they did prey upon blacks, Wilson conceded, but black fears of the Klan were “comic.”\nIn “Wrong on Race: The Democratic Party’s Buried Past,” Bruce Bartlett relates countless such anecdotes to show that while the Republican Party is endlessly smeared as racist, at its worst, it could not hold a candle to the party of Wilson and FDR.\nWhat brings this history up is the media assault on Gov. Haley Barbour for his answer to an interviewer’s question as to why his hometown, Yazoo City, avoided the violence that attended the desegregation of other cities in the Mississippi of his youth. Haley’s reply:\n“You heard of the Citizens’ Councils? Up north they think it was like the KKK. Where I come from it was an organization of town leaders. In Yazoo City, they passed a resolution that said anybody who started a chapter of the Klan would get their a– run out of town. If you had a job, you’d lose it. If you had a store, they’d see nobody shopped there. We didn’t have a problem with the Klan in Yazoo City.”\nNo one has contradicted the facts as stated by Haley, that the Citizens’ Council of Yazoo City consisted of “town leaders” who did not want any Klan violence ripping their town apart.\nBut if Haley had meant to leave the impression that the White Citizens’ Councils were promoting peaceful integration, that would have been laughable. Like almost all the U.S. senators from the 11 states of the Old Confederacy who signed the Dixie Manifesto opposing the Brown decision, the White Citizens’ Councils believed in massive resistance to integration.\nAfter 24 hours of media bashing, Haley sought to silence his tormenters with this clarification:\n“My point was my town rejected the Ku Klux Klan, but nobody should construe that to mean the town leadership were saints, either. Their vehicle, called the ‘Citizens’ Council,’ is totally indefensible, as is segregation. It was a difficult and painful era for Mississippi, the rest of the country and especially African-Americans who were persecuted in that time.”\nThus did Haley throw the town fathers of Yazoo City, many of whom he must have come to know as friends, under the bus to restore his acceptability to media elites, some of whom he probably detests.\nSuch are the demands of political advancement in America.\nYet, as Voltaire observed, history is a pack of lies agreed upon.\nUndeniably, across the South in the 1950s and 1960s, there was broad and deep resistance to integration. But it is also true that all the Senate signers of the Dixie Manifesto and all but two of the House signers were Democrats in good standing in the party of JFK and LBJ.\nAnd while civil right workers and others were brutally killed in the 1960s, the real racial violence occurred in the North — in the Harlem riot of 1964, the Watts riot of 1965, the Detroit and Newark riots of 1967 and the wave of riots that broke out in scores of cities after the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. There were days of looting and burning in Washington, D.C.\nWho was responsible for that wave of racial violence? Was it the black rioters themselves? The Democratic machines and mayors that ran almost all of the Northern cities? The Johnson administration?\nBecause it was surely not Republicans, who in the 1960s were nonexistent in the South and shut out of power in Washington and most major cities and state capitals after JFK’s victory and LBJ’s landslide.\nThe Nixon White House is endlessly denounced for a “Southern Strategy” that captured all 11 states of the Old Confederacy in 1972. But Nixon’s vice president was a pro-civil rights governor, Spiro Agnew of Maryland, who had defeated George P. (“your-home-is-your-castle”) Mahoney, a Democrat who ran in 1966 on his opposition to open housing.\nIn the six presidential elections in which Wilson and FDR topped the ticket, Democrats carried all 11 Southern states every time.\nOutside of Missouri, Deep South states were the only ones Adlai Stevenson carried in 1956. The sainted Adlai balanced both his tickets with Dixiecrats: John Sparkman of Alabama and Estes Kefauver of Tennessee.\nAs Haley Barbour can attest, liberal hypocrisy is exceeded only by liberal amnesia about who kept them in power from 1933 to 1968.", "id": "<urn:uuid:6a6acafc-61b2-4790-84e6-42d0177b4ea3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://buchanan.org/blog/woody-haley-the-klan-4586", "date": "2013-05-18T06:30:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9766536355018616, "token_count": 1142, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "According to Buddhist tradition, the disciple Devadatta was the Buddha's cousin and also brother to the Buddha's wife, Yasodhara. Devadatta is said to have caused a split in the sangha by persuading 500 monks to leave the Buddha and follow him instead.\nThis story of Devadatta is preserved in the Pali Tipitika. In this story, Devadatta entered the order of Buddhist monks at the same time as Ananda and other noble youths of the Shakya clan, the clan of the historical Buddha.\nDevadatta applied himself to practice. But he became frustrated when he failed to progress toward becoming an arhat. So, instead, he applied his practice toward developing supernatural power instead of the realization of enlightenment.\nIt was said he also became driven by jealousy of his kinsman, the Buddha. Devadatta believed he should be the World-Honored One and the leader of the order of monks.\nOne day he approached the Buddha and pointed out that the Buddha was growing older. He proposed that he be put in charge of the order to relieve the Buddha of the burden. The Buddha rebuked Devadatta harshly and said he was not worthy. Thus Devadatta became the Buddha's enemy.\nLater, the Buddha was questioned how his harsh response to Devadatta was justified as Right Speech. I'll come back to this a bit later.\nDevadatta had gained the favor of Prince Ajatasattu of Magadha. Ajatasattu's father, King Bimbisara, was a devoted patron of the Buddha. Devadatta persuaded the prince to murder his father and assume the throne of Magadha.\nAt the same time, Devadatta vowed to have the Buddha murdered so he could take over the sangha. So that the deed could not be traced back to Devadatta, the plan was to send a second group of \"hit men\" to assassinate the first one, and then a third group to take out the second one, and so on for some time. But when the would-be assassins approached the Buddha they couldn't carry out the order.\nThen Devadatta tried to do the job himself, by dropping a rock on the Buddha. The rock bounced off the mountain side and broke into pieces. The next attempt involved a large bull elephant in a drug-induced fury, but the elephant was gentled in the Buddha's presence.\nFinally Devadatta attempted to split the sangha by claiming superior moral rectitude. He proposed a list of austerities and asked that they become mandatory for all monks and nuns. These were:\n- Monks must live all their lives in the forest.\n- Monks must live only on alms obtained by begging, and should not accept invitations to dine with others.\n- Monks must wear robes made only from rags collected from rubbish heaps and cremation grounds. They must not accept donations of cloth at any time. (See Kathina.)\n- Monks must sleep at the foot of trees and not under a roof.\n- Monks must refrain from eating fish or meat throughout their lives.\nThe Buddha responded as Devadatta had predicted he would. He said that monks could follow the first four austerities if they wished, but he refused to make them mandatory. And he rejected the fifth austerity entirely. (See Buddhism and Vegetarianism.)\nDevadatta persuaded 500 monks that his Super Austerity Plan was a surer path to enlightenment than the Buddha's, and they followed Devadatta to become his disciples. In response, the Buddha sent two of his disciples, Sariputra and Mahamaudgayalyana, to teach the dharma to the wayward monks. Upon hearing the dharma explained correctly, the 500 monks returned to the Buddha.\nDevadatta was now a sorry and broken man, and he soon fell mortally ill. On his deathbed he repented of his misdeeds and wished to see the Buddha one more time, but Devadatta died before his liter-bearers could reach him.\nLife of Devadatta, Alternate Version\nThe lives of the Buddha and his disciples were preserved in several oral recitation traditions before they were written down. The Pali tradition, which is the foundation of Theravada Buddhism, is the best known. Another oral tradition was preserved by the Mahasanghika sect, which was formed about 320 BCE. Mahasanghika is an important forerunner of Mahayana.\nMahasanghika remembered Devadatta as a devout and saintly monk. No trace of the \"evil Devadatta\" story can be found in their version of the canon. This has led some scholars to speculate that the story of the renegade Devadatta is a later invention.\nThe Abhaya Sutta, on Right Speech\nIf we assume the Pali version of Devadatta's story is the more accurate one, however, we can find an interesting footnote in the Abhava Sutta of the Pali Tipitika (Majjhima Nikaya 58). In brief, the Buddha was questioned about the harsh words he said to Devadatta that caused him to turn against the Buddha.\nThe Buddha justified his criticisms of Devadatta by comparing him to a small child who had taken a pebble into his mouth and was about to swallow it. Adults would naturally do whatever it took to get the pebble out of the child. Even if extracting the pebble drew blood, it must be done. The moral appears to be that it is better to hurt someone's feelings than to let them dwell in deceitfulness.", "id": "<urn:uuid:d836bf06-262b-4bca-8851-41ec64e31038>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://buddhism.about.com/od/The-Disciples/a/The-Story-Of-Devadatta.htm", "date": "2013-05-18T07:14:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9810645580291748, "token_count": 1172, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Carefully remove it from the microwave, squeeze it to make sure it's soft in the center, and the allow it cool as you cook the next one. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them open and scoop the flesh into a large bowl.\nSTEP 2: Slice the green onions and roughly chop a handful of cilantro (about 1/8th of a bunch). Add the green onions, cilantro, frozen corn kernels, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper to the bowl with the cooked sweet potatoes. Stir until well combined. You can taste it at this point and adjust the seasoning as desired.\nSTEP 3: Add the breadcrumbs, cornmeal, and egg to the bowl. These ingredients will bind the mixture together and keep it from falling apart while cooking. Stir until evenly combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the breadcrumbs to absorb moisture.\nSTEP 4: While the sweet potato mixture is refrigerating, mix up the garlic sauce. In a small bowl combine the yogurt, one clove of well minced garlic, and a handful of cilantro leaves (roughly chopped). Stir until combined and then refrigerate until ready to serve.\nSTEP 5: After the sweet potato mixture has refrigerated, it's time to cook. Add enough vegetable oil to fully cover the bottom of a medium skillet. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until the surface appears wavy (if it begins to smoke, remove it from the burner immediately and turn down the heat). Shape the sweet potato mixture into small patties (about 2-3 Tbsp each) and cook about 4 at a time in the hot oil. Cook until golden brown on each side; about 2 minutes per side. After cooking, place on a paper towel covered plate to drain. Add more oil to the skillet as needed.\nServe warm with the garlic yogurt dipping sauce.\nStep By Step Photos\nStart by pricking the skin of each sweet potato to allow steam to escape as they cook. No one wants to clean exploded sweet potato out of their microwave.\nWrap one potato in a paper towel and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Carefully squeeze it to make sure it's soft in the center and then cook the next one. I used one paper towel for all four sweet potatoes.\nThey'll be super hot when they come out of the microwave, so let them cool just a bit before cutting into them. Slice it open and scoop out the cooked flesh.\nPlace the cooked sweet potato in a bowl and add the frozen corn kernels (they'll help cool the sweet potato the rest of the way), sliced green onions, roughly chopped cilantro, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Stir it all together.\nNow it's time to add the binders. I used one egg, 1/3 cup of cornmeal (it helps bind and gives more texture than just breadcrumbs) and one cup of breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs are not in the picture (don't ask). Stir it all together and then refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nWhile the sweet potato mix is refrigerating, make the garlic yogurt sauce. Finely mince a clove of garlic and roughly chop another handful of cilantro. Stir those into a cup of plain yogurt. You can add a pinch of salt if you'd like. Refrigerate the sauce until you're ready to serve.\nAfter the mixture has chilled, it's time to cook. Take about 2 Tbsp of sweet potato mix and shape it into a small patty. My mixture was still pretty wet/sticky, but it was shape-able.\nHeat some vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. You want the oil to be quite hot before adding the cakes. It should look wavy on the surface. You can take a pinch of the sweet potato mixture and add it to the skillet to test it. It should sizzle heavily. Add about four patties to the skillet and cook until deep golden brown on one side, then flip.\nCook on the other side in the same manner. It should only take about two minutes per side. Try not to make your patties too thick otherwise the inside won't heat through before the outside browns. About a half inch thick is good.\nPlace the cooked sweet potato cakes on a paper towel lined plate and cook the next batch. Add more oil as needed, always allowing it to heat up before adding more sweet potato cakes.\nWhy, hello there little warm, delicious sweet potato cake...", "id": "<urn:uuid:88da4edf-2e92-4448-b23c-71919bda481c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://budgetbytes.blogspot.com/2012/07/sweet-potato-corn-cakes-with-garlic.html?showComment=1341347902104", "date": "2013-05-18T07:19:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9274466633796692, "token_count": 1425, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Commercial Noise", "Commercial Noise", "Commercial Noise", "Commercial Noise", "Commercial Noise", "Commercial Noise", "Commercial Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Public Papers - 1991\nWhite House Fact Sheet on The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)\nToday, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. This treaty marks the first agreement between the two countries in which the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons will actually be reduced. Reductions will take place over a period of 7 years, and will result in parity between the strategic nuclear forces of the two sides at levels approximately 30 percent below currently deployed forces. Deeper cuts are required in the most dangerous and destabilizing systems.\nSTART provisions are designed to strengthen strategic stability at lower levels and to encourage the restructuring of strategic forces in ways that make them more stable and less threatening. The treaty includes a wide variety of very demanding verification measures designed to ensure compliance and build confidence.\nThe treaty sets equal ceilings on the number of strategic nuclear forces that can be deployed by either side. In addition, the treaty establishes an equal ceiling on ballistic missile throw-weight (a measure of overall capability for ballistic missiles). Each side is limited to no more than:\n-- 1600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM's], submarine launched ballistic missiles [SLBM's], and heavy bombers), a limit that is 36 percent below the Soviet level declared in September 1990 and 29 percent below the U.S. level.\n-- 6000 total accountable warheads, about 41 percent below the current Soviet level and 43 percent below the current U.S. level.\n-- 4900 accountable warheads deployed on ICBM's or SLBM's, about 48 percent below the current Soviet level and 40 percent below the current U.S. level.\n-- 1540 accountable warheads deployed on 154 heavy ICBM's, a 50-percent reduction in current Soviet forces. The U.S. has no heavy ICBM's.\n-- 1100 accountable warheads deployed on mobile ICBM's.\n-- Aggregate throw-weight of deployed ICBM's and SLBM's equal to about 54 percent of the current Soviet aggregate throw-weight.\nBallistic Missile Warhead Accountability\nThe treaty uses detailed counting rules to ensure the accurate accounting of the number of warheads attributed to each type of ballistic missile.\n-- Each deployed ballistic missile warhead counts as 1 under the 4900 ceiling and 1 under the 6000 overall warhead ceiling.\n-- Each side is allowed 10 on-site inspections each year to verify that deployed ballistic missiles contain no more warheads than the number that is attributed to them under the treaty.\nDownloading Ballistic Missile Warheads\nThe treaty also allows for a reduction in the number of warheads on certain ballistic missiles, which will help the sides transition their existing forces to the new regime. Such downloading is permitted in a carefully structured and limited fashion.\n-- The U.S. may download its three-warhead Minuteman III ICBM by either one or two warheads. The Soviet Union has already downloaded it's seven warhead SS - N - 18 SLBM by four warheads.\n-- In addition, each side may download up to 500 warheads on two other existing types of ballistic missiles, as long as the total number of warheads removed from downloaded missiles does not exceed 1250 at any one time.\nThe treaty places constraints on the characteristics of new types of ballistic missiles to ensure the accuracy of counting rules and prevent undercounting of missile warheads.\n-- The number of warheads attributed to a new type of ballistic missile must be no less than the number determined by dividing 40 percent of the missile's total throw-weight by the weight of the lightest RV tested on that missile.\n-- The throw-weight attributed to a new type must be no less than the missile's throw-weight capability at specified reference ranges (11,000 km for ICBM's and 9,500 km for SLBM's).\nSTART places significant restrictions on the Soviet SS - 18 heavy ICBM.\n-- A 50-percent reduction in the number of Soviet SS - 18 ICBM's; a total reduction of 154 of these Soviet missiles.\n-- New types of heavy ICBM's are banned.\n-- Downloading of heavy ICBM's is banned.\n-- Heavy SLBM's and heavy mobile ICBM's are banned.\n-- Heavy ICBM's will be reduced on a more stringent schedule than other strategic arms.\nBecause mobile missiles are more difficult to verify than other types of ballistic missiles, START incorporates a number of special restrictions and notifications with regard to these missiles. These measures will significantly improve our confidence that START will be effectively verifiable.\n-- Nondeployed mobile missiles and non-deployed mobile launchers are numerically and geographically limited so as to limit the possibility for reload and refire.\n-- The verification regime includes continuous monitoring of mobile ICBM production, restrictions on movements, on-site inspections, and cooperative measures to improve the effectiveness of national technical means of intelligence collection.\nBecause heavy bombers are stabilizing strategic systems (e.g., they are less capable of a short-warning attack than ballistic missiles), START counting rules for weapons on bombers are different than those for ballistic missile warheads.\n-- Each heavy bomber counts as one strategic nuclear delivery vehicle.\n-- Each heavy bomber equipped to carry only short-range missiles or gravity bombs is counted as one warhead under the 6000 limit.\n-- Each U.S. heavy bomber equipped to carry long-range nuclear ALCM's (up to a maximum of 150 bombers) is counted as 10 warheads even though it may be equipped to carry up to 20 ALCM's.\n-- A similar discount applies to Soviet heavy bombers equipped to carry long-range nuclear ALCM's. Each such Soviet heavy bomber (up to a maximum of 180) is counted as 8 warheads even though it may be equipped to carry up to 16 ALCM's.\n-- Any heavy bomber equipped for long-range nuclear ALCM's deployed in excess of 150 for the U.S. or 180 for the Soviet Union will be accountable by the number of ALCM's the heavy bomber is actually equipped to carry.\nBuilding on recent arms control agreements, START includes extensive and unprecedented verification provisions. This comprehensive verification regime greatly reduces the likelihood that violations would go undetected.\n-- START bans the encryption and encapsulation of telemetric information and other forms of information denial on flight tests of ballistic missiles. However, strictly limited exemptions to this ban are granted sufficient to protect the flight-testing of sensitive research projects.\n-- START allows 12 different types of on-site inspections and requires roughly 60 different types of notifications covering production, testing, movement, deployment, and destruction of strategic offensive arms.\nSTART will have a duration of 15 years, unless it is superseded by a subsequent agreement. If the sides agree, the treaty may be extended for successive 5-year periods beyond the 15 years.\nNoncircumvention and Third Countries\nSTART prohibits the transfer of strategic offensive arms to third countries, except that the treaty will not interfere with existing patterns of cooperation. In addition, the treaty prohibits the permanent basing of strategic offensive arms outside the national territory of each side.\nAir-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM's)\nSTART does not directly count or limit ALCM's. ALCM's are limited indirectly through their association with heavy bombers.\n-- Only nuclear-armed ALCM's with a range in excess of 600 km are covered by START.\n-- Long-range, conventionally armed ALCM's that are distinguishable from nuclear-armed ALCM's are not affected.\n-- Long-range nuclear-armed ALCM's may not be located at air bases for heavy bombers not accountable as being equipped for such ALCM's.\n-- Multiple warhead long-range nuclear ALCM's are banned.\nSea Launched Cruise Missiles (SLCM's)\nSLCMs are not constrained by the treaty. However, each side has made a politically binding declaration as to its plans for the deployment of nuclear-armed SLCM's. Conventionally-armed SLCM's are not subject to such a declaration.\n-- Each side will make an annual declaration of the maximum number of nuclear-armed SLCM's with a range greater than 600 km that it plans to deploy for each of the following 5 years.\n-- This number will not be greater than 880 long-range nuclear-armed SLCM's.\n-- In addition, as a confidence building measure, nuclear-armed SLCM's with a range of 300 - 600 km will be the subject of a confidential annual data exchange.\nThe Soviet Backfire bomber is not constrained by the treaty. However, the Soviet side has made a politically binding declaration that it will not deploy more than 800 air force and 200 naval Backfire bombers, and that these bombers will not be given intercontinental capability.\nThe START agreement consists of the treaty document itself and a number of associated documents. Together they total more than 700 pages. The treaty was signed in a public ceremony by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev in St. Vladimir's Hall in the Kremlin. The associated documents were signed in a private ceremony at Novo Ogaryevo, President Gorbachev's weekend dacha. Seven of these documents were signed by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. Three associated agreements were signed by Secretary Baker and Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh. In addition, the START negotiators, Ambassadors Brooks and Nazarkin, exchanged seven letters related to START in a separate event at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow.\nMagnitude of START -- Accountable Reductions\nFollowing is the aggregate data from the Memorandum of Understanding, based upon agreed counting rules in START. (Because of those counting rules, the number of heavy bomber weapons actually deployed may be higher than the number shown in the aggregate.) This data is effective as of September 1990\n(TABLE START)and will be updated at entry into force:\nDelivery Vehicles .... 2,246 .... 2,500\nWarheads .... 10,563 .... 10,271\nBallistic Missile Warheads .... 8,210 .... 9,416\nHeavy ICBM's/Warheads ....

A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment.\nMullen announced he was leaving Goldman in January, after 11 years at the firm. He joined the bank as a partner in July 2001 to head leveraged finance.\nAs a senior mortgage executive at Goldman, Mullen was actively engaged in derivatives trades that became widely known on Wall Street as “the big short.” The deals provided a way for traders and hedge funds to bet against the housing market in the run-up to the mortgage bust.\nBefore joining Goldman in 2001, Mullen had held top jobs at Bear Stearns, Salomon Brothers and Drexel Burnham Lambert.\nThe sources familiar with Mullen’s fund said it will raise money to go after homes being sold at foreclosure or taken over by banks. The fund will target homes that are selling for between US$70,000 and US$190,000 and mainly in the southeastern and southwestern regions of the United States.\nMoney managers are being drawn to the foreclosed home market because the rental market for single-family homes has become lucrative. The goal for many foreclosed home funds is to eventually sell the homes even in blocks, or as part of real-estate investment trust.\nThe foreclosed home market is attracting interest from individual investors, who are seeking higher income in an environment where 10-year Treasury notes yield a paltry 1.5%.\nThe market got a big shot in the arm earlier this year when the U.S. government announced a trial project to sell-off a big pool of 2,500 single-family homes that Fannie Mae currently owns in some of the hardest-hit housing markets.\nOn Wednesday, private equity firm Blackstone Group LP said it has spent more than US$300-million to purchase over 2,000 foreclosed home across the United States with an eye toward renting them out until the housing market recovers.\nAsset management firm TCW, which specializes in fixed-income securities and oversees US$128-billion in assets, recently launched the TCW Home Place Partners fund, as an opportunity for wealthy investors to invest in the “housing turnaround” by buying foreclosed homes from banks and federal government agencies.\nAnd in May, Beazer Homes USA, Inc announced it was partnering with private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. to buy foreclosed homes.", "id": "<urn:uuid:02f173de-3ff3-468e-9703-2afd91f98924>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://business.financialpost.com/2012/07/20/ex-goldman-mortgage-chief-plans-foreclosure-fund-aimed-at-wealthy-investors/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9661023616790771, "token_count": 864, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Stocks are flat after surprise drop in unemployment claims, upbeat retail sales; Dow near 11KBy Stephen Bernard, AP\nThursday, October 7, 2010\nStocks mixed after positive job news; Dow near 11K\nNEW YORK — Stocks seesawed Thursday as traders balanced slightly better news on jobs against mixed results from PepsiCo Inc. The Dow Jones industrial average came within two points of 11,000 before turning slightly lower.\nThe Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell last week, a better result than analysts were expecting. Retailers including Macy’s Inc., Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brands Inc. reported better-than-expected monthly sales.\nMany traders were holding back ahead of the release Friday of the government’s closely watched monthly employment report, which is the most important event on the economic calendar and very often determines which way stocks and bonds will trade. Economists expect the unemployment rate climbed to 9.7 percent last month from 9.6 percent in August.\nClaims for unemployment insurance have been falling steadily in recent weeks, but still indicate that employers aren’t ramping up hiring. Payroll company ADP said Wednesday that private employers slashed jobs in September for the first time in seven months.\nHigh unemployment remains a main obstacle to stronger economic growth. Worries about jobs had been keeping a lid on spending in recent months, though retailers reported Thursday that sales improved modestly in September.\nThe Dow fell 21.04, or 0.2 percent, to 10,946.53 in midday trading, after having been up as much as 31 points shortly after the open. The Dow hasn’t traded above 11,000 since May 4, shortly before the “flash crash” that sent indexes on a harrowing but brief plunge.\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 2.28, or 0.2 percent, to 1,157.69, while the Nasdaq composite rose 2.38, or 0.1 percent, to 2,383.04.\nPepsiCo said its third-quarter profit jumped in part on revenue gains following its acquisition of its two largest bottlers earlier this year. Earnings matched expectations, but the company narrowed its earnings outlook to a level below analysts’ forecasts.\nAlcoa Inc. will be the first component of the Dow Jones industrial average to report earnings when it releases results after the market closes.\nPepsiCo and Alcoa provide a glimpse into how companies were able to deal with slowing economic growth over the summer and provide insight into where corporate executives believe the economy is headed. Analysts have said earnings outlooks and revenue growth will be vital to propelling stocks higher in the next few weeks as hundreds of companies report results.\nStocks are coming off a historically strong performances in September, and analysts say the market will need significant doses of positive news on the economy, corporate earnings or preferably both before heading decisively higher again. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 10.4 percent in September, but is still 2.1 percent below its 2010 high reached on April 26.\nFalling stocks narrowly outpaced those that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 357.5 million shares.\nPepsiCo fell $2.32, or 3.4 percent, to $65.79. Limited Brands shares rose $1.08, or 3.9 percent, to $28.67, while Abercrombie & Fitch jumped $3.60, or 9.4 percent, to $42.19. Macy’s fell 21 cents to $23.49 after rising earlier in the day.\nBond yields remained near their lowest levels since January 2009 as traders expect the Federal Reserve to step up its purchases of Treasurys in order lower interest rates and encourage borrowing.\nCliff Draughn, president and chief investment officer at Excelsia Investment Advisors, said the Fed could act as early as its next meeting that wraps up Nov. 3. The timing of the Fed re-entering the Treasury market hinges on how the investors react to election results Nov 2.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, was unchanged at 2.39 percent compared with late Wednesday. Its yield helps set interest rates on a variety of loans including mortgages.\nMortgage buyer Freddie Mac said rates on traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages reached their lowest level on records dating back to 1971.\nThe dollar continued to fall against other major currencies as traders expect U.S. interest rates to fall further. Currencies with higher interest rates become more attractive to foreign exchange traders when U.S. rates fall.\nGold, which is considered a safe alternative to the dollar, hit another record of $1,366.00 an ounce early Thursday before pulling back to $1,336.00 an ounce.\nOverseas, Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.3 percent, Germany’s DAX index gained 0.1 percent, and France’s CAC-40 rose 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent.\nTags: Labor Economy, Labor Issues, New York, North America, Personal Finance, Personal Loans, Real Estate, Unemployment Insurance, United States", "id": "<urn:uuid:10385bd3-495c-494f-804b-c4e96d40947c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://business.gaeatimes.com/2010/10/07/stocks-are-flat-after-surprise-drop-in-unemployment-claims-upbeat-retail-sales-dow-near-11k-113516/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9484822154045105, "token_count": 1101, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}
{"text": "University of Stellenbosch economics professor Servaas van der Berg is the latest academic to attack recruitment firm Adcorp’s employment statistics, describing them as \"dangerous fictions\".\nThe Adcorp Employment index is published monthly. Unlike figures from Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), it is not based on surveys and relies upon its own data gathered in interviews with job recruits.\nIt also uses a controversial methodology to estimate the size of the informal sector to arrive at an estimate of total employment.\n› Adcorp job figures fiction - Prof\n› Eurozone slips deeper into recession\nIn an article on Econ3x3, a new online policy forum, Prof van der Berg writes that Adcorp’s data \"is so clearly wrong that it does not even warrant paying their methodologies serious attention\".\nHe urges people to consider the \"obvious inconsistencies\" in Adcorp’s numbers by juxtaposing its unemployment figure - which it put at 1-million people in 2011 - with the number of unemployed graduates, which it estimated to be 600 000 at the time.\nThis would mean, Prof van der Berg writes, that based on a labour force of 20-million and a graduate population of 1.1-million, unemployment was 5% for the population and 54% for graduates.\nIn contrast, the last quarterly labour force survey compiled by Stats SA put unemployment at 25.5% and in 2011 found that broad graduate unemployment ( for all tertiary qualifications ) was 340 000.\nThe Adcorp employment index estimates the informal sector to be much larger than estimates from other organisations. It uses the currency demand method to arrive at its estimate, which takes the amount of cash circulating to estimate the size of the activity not recorded in the formal economy.\nThe result is a much higher number of employed : 19-million according to Adcorp and 13.5-million according to Stats SA.\nThis methodology has been criticised in detail by University of Cape Town academics Andrew Kerr and Martin Wittenberg, in two papers written last year.\n\"The Adcorp employment and unemployment figures are dangerous fictions - and need to be exposed as such,\" Prof van der Berg writes.\n\"It is unfortunate that the news media publish them as if they come from a credible source. That feeds at least two contradictory and mistaken beliefs: that unemployment is not a problem of great consequence, and that graduate unemployment is a problem of grandiose proportions.\n\"Neither of these two conclusions could be further from the truth.\"\nAdcorp economist Loane Sharp said Prof van der Berg’s criticisms were \"parochial\" while his methodology enjoyed international recognition. He said he would not debate the size of the informal economy - as he had done it before - and won.\nMr Sharp said the apparent anomalies in the number of unemployed graduates compared to the rest of the population was because \"there is a problem with Stats SA data\".\nHe believed Prof van der Berg had incorrectly read Stats SA figures on graduate unemployment.\nStatistician-general Pali Lehohla, who has been arguing with Adcorp over its employment numbers for years, said on Thursday the company’s objectivity was compromised.\n\"They are an employment agency. That compromises them severely. To collect statistics, you need to be policy neutral. You can’t measure statistics when you have an interest, especially where the benefits are financial.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:f34687a3-642b-425c-95c3-1ce3e37ae31f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://business.iafrica.com/businessday/842718.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:55:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9444659948348999, "token_count": 708, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

This honor enables qualifying Post-9/11 veterans to attend Baldwin Wallace University tuition free.\nHow do I know which benefits\nI am eligible for?\nHow do I choose between the Post-911 benefits and the Montgomery GI Bill?\nEach veteran's benefits differ based on type and length of service and whether you have already used the Montgomery GI Bill.\nTalk with an Education Case Worker/\nVeteran's Benefits Counselor\nin the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nEducational Benefits for Veterans\nReceiving VA Benefits - VA Form 22-1990\nYour first step in receiving educational benefits for your military service is to submit VA Form 22-1990 (Application for VA Education Benefits) - either by paper or online. The Veteran's Online Application (VONAPP) allows you to submit your request online. If applying online, you must send the VA a signature card - they will not process any application without a signature.\nA number of web links and contacts are listed on the right side of this page to assist you. In addition, a good resource is www.TodaysGIBill.org, a web site designed to assist service members and veterans with clear, comprehensive guidance on the steps to making the most out of their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.\nEnrollment Certification at BW\nOnce you have applied and been admitted to Baldwin Wallace University, you will need to work with Baldwin Wallace to certify your enrollment to the Veteran's Administration (VA). Each semester, BW must report how many hours you will be enrolled during that term. To have your enrollment certified at BW each semester, contact:\nRegistration & Records, Bonds Hall\nEnrollment verification is done by the student at the end of each month to let the VA know that your enrollment information has not changed. Your enrollment can be verified starting on the last calendar day of the month online by using WAVE - the Web Automated Verification of Enrollment at https://www.gibill.va.gov/wave or by calling toll free 1-877-823-2378. The VA will send you a Certificate of Eligibility that states your remaining entitlement and monthly disbursement amounts. Your GI Bill check will normally be mailed to you at the beginning of each month for the previous month.

If you have questions, call 1-800-827-1000 to speak with a Veteran's Benefits Counselor in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRegarding Financial Aid:\nIn addition to GI Bill or other VA educational benefits, most veteran students may be eligible for financial aid such as federal or state grants and Federal Direct student loans. Veteran students may also be eligible to receive a BW scholarship or merit award, as determined through the admission process. However, if a veteran receives 100% in tuition benefits through the GI Bill or other VA education benefits, they will not receive additional financial aid or scholarships above the cost of tuition. Submitting the FAFSA and determining financial aid eligibility can assist in helping veterans pay for college once their GI Bill or other VA education benefits have been exhausted.\nOur web site gives lots of information on Financial Aid, or to talk with a financial aid counselor, contact:\nFinancial Aid Office, Bonds Hall\nOhio National Guard Scholarships\nIf you are receiving a scholarship from the Ohio National Guard, contact Carolyn McCluskey in Financial Aid to make sure that BW has a copy of your scholarship approval through the Ohio National Guard.\nVA Form 28-1905\nIf your eligibility for benefits includes submitting the VA Form 28-1905 (Authorization and Certification of Entrance/Re-entrance into Rehabilitation and Certification of Status), please contact:\nMarcia Shaffer, Bursar's Office", "id": "<urn:uuid:2991993d-7960-4dd5-a937-d1e7a6074dec>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bw.edu/academics/veterans/benefits/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:42Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9230461120605469, "token_count": 815, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Navigational;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Warchant TV: Greg Reid on the Miami win\nWhen Florida State punt returner Greg Reid drops back it's always an adventure. During Saturday's 23-19 win over Miami, Reid's adventure was of epic proportions.\nIn the second corner Reid fielded a punt on his own goaline. He made a few Hurricanes miss as he made it out the 11-yard line, but a personal foul pushed FSU back to its own six.\nOn his next punt return attempt Reid fielded the ball on a hop, made one move and sprinted 83 yards to the house for a touchdown just before halftime.\n\"Greg thinks every play is a touchdown,\" head coach Jimbo Fisher said after the game. \"That's what makes him great, but also he has to be smart in some situations and he almost had another one\nGreg's mentality is like that and I'd rather say whoa than giddy up any day of the week.\"\nReid finished the game with 106 yards on three punt returns, an average of 35.3 yards per return.\nThe 83-yard score was the longest of Reid's career and the fourth longest in school history. It Reid's his first score since taking a punt back against Samford in the 2010 season opener.\nReid looked like he might have had one earlier in the year against Maryland, but was called for an illegal fair catch signal and the play was whistled dead. Saturday Reid said he felt a sense of relief as he turned around after the score and didn't see any flags down, but the return opened up for him once the kick bounced.\n\"I think he kind of shanked the kick a little bit and it gave me the one-hop and I took it,\" Reid said. \"I looked up and I was just looking for somebody to give a move to and it was just there.\"\nThe 5-foot-8, 186-pound junior said he tries to attack every punt, so he didn't dwell on his mistake earlier in the quarter. He did recognize it was a mistake after the game though.\n\"I had my heels on the 11 yard line, I just kept going back,\" he said of the miscue. \"I actually thought he had out-kicked his coverage, but then again we were playing against Miami, all those guys run about a 4.3. That was just a dumb decision by me, but I made up for it so in the film room I won't get it that bad.\"\nWhile Reid's up and down performance may be agonizing for fans to watch at times, it is also one the most electric parts of each FSU game. Even his teammates can't take their eyes of the field when he's deep to return.\n\"It definitely is fun to sit back and watch him make plays,\" receiver Christian Green said of Reid. \"He's an explosive returner. I feel like he's one the best in the country so you feel like a fan in the stands watching when we see him return kicks.\"\nPowell pins the 'Canes\nAfter not being named a semifinalist for the Ray Guy Award on Friday afternoon, senior punter Shawn Powell turned in one the best performances of his career.\nPowell punted four times, all four punts were over 50 yards and had a net average of 47.4 yards. Twice he pinned Miami inside it's own 10-yard line. His first punt of the game went 51 yards and was marked out of bounds at the Hurricane one-yard line.\n\"I think it was,\" Powell said when asked if it was the best punt of his career. \"For a regular punt that was probably the best punt I've hit.\"\nThe two punts inside the Miami 10-yard line gave Powell and ACC-best nine punts inside the 10 this season.\n\"He had a breakout game, his first punt inside the one,\" kicker Dustin Hopkins saif after the game. \"It kind of beats down the spirits of the team when you're inside your own endzone. He's up for player of the game and rightfully so, because it is such hidden yardage and momentum that a lot of people overlook.\"\nWhile Powell admitted being left off the Ray Guy list was disappointing, a solid performance in his final game against rival Miami helped erase the disappointment.\n\"It was great,\" Powell said of his career day. \"I had some setbacks this week, but I let those things go past me with the Ray Guy thing. I just have to do what's best for my team and if I can continue to contribute for my team then that's all that matters.\"\nWith less than two minutes left in the game and Miami driving to get back into the game, linebacker Nigel Bradham was ejected from the game for launching himself into Hurricanes' receiver LaRon Byrd at the FSU 21-yard line.\nBradham appeared to hit Bryd with his shoulder, not his helmet, but was still ejected for launching himself at a defenseless receiver.\n\"It looked like he hit him with a shoulder and he hit him in the ribs or chest in my opinion,\" Fisher said after the game. \"And I can't see it-but they said he launched, I don't know. I guess that's the rule, then that's the rule. I'll have to clarify it tomorrow and look at it on film.\"\nBecause he was ejected from the game, Bradham and Fisher both feared that the senior linebacker would be suspend for part of or all of next week's final home against Virginia.\nAtlantic Coast Conference Associate Commissioner Michael Kelly told Warchant.com after the game that a player can only be suspended mandatory if he is ejected for fighting, which obviously Bradham was not.\nFlorida State receiver Rashad Greene took the field in the second quarter, his first game action since the Wake Forest game on Oct. 8. Greene had collected more than 450 receiving yards in the Seminoles' first five games.\nWith field goals of 21 and 38 yard Dustin Hopkins moved into fifth-place all-time for career points with 310. He passed Gary Cismesia (308 points) on Saturday. Next up is Sebastian Janikowski who ranks fourth with 323 career points.\nIt was star-studded event along the sidelines of Doak Campbell Stadium Saturday night. Former Seminoles Drew Weatherford, Dexter Carter, Craphonso Thorpe, and Matt Henshaw were among the former players in attendance.\nMembers of the Tampa Bay Rays were also in attendance Saturday including ace pitcher David Price and outfielder B.J.

{"text": "Evidence-Based Building: It's All by Numbers\nThe Byggmeister Perspective\nWegoWise may sound like the latest Hasbro toy, but this web-based energy tracking system is actually a powerful new addition to Byggmeister's green-building toolkit. It is easy to say certain improvements will save energy. Paul and the rest of the Byggmeister crew want to prove it to their clients and themselves. Byggmeister Sustainability Consultant Rachel White and client Dick Jones share both sides of the story and a little bit of inner data-loving geekiness too.\nWhy did Byggmeister decide to use WegoWise? RW: When you step back and think about how most energy upgrades are done in the residential sector, you think if we do this it will save about X amount each year, but no builder is really looking at hard and fast numbers when they say that. We want to see how much money and energy upgrade X or Y is actually saving, from adding insulation and fixing air leaks, all the way to a complete deep energy retrofit.\nHow does it work? RW: You enter your utility account information and WegoWise retrieves the data automatically from online bills each month. We had started trying to track that ourselves, asking homeowners to give us the information after we complete an energy project, but it is hard to keep going back for it. This streamlines the whole process and Byggmeister is now offering it as part of our services. We'll set up the accounts, monitor the data, everything. It is free to the homeowner and all the information is shared between us.\nHow does Byggmeister use the data? RW: WegoWise has great analytical and graphing that allows you to look at total energy usage and compare that to similar buildings in energy usage per square foot. We can compare our portfolio of projects against one another, and we can also compare against the WegoWise broader pool. That gives us real insight by drilling down and seeing how this particular upgrade, like a basement retrofit, actually impacted energy savings. It takes the guesswork out of it and we can take that to future clients and apply it because we have concrete numbers. We call it \"evidence-based building.\"\nWhat has the data shown? RW: On a couple of our deep energy retrofit projects, it's very dramatic. Per square foot, they use 60 to 65 percent less energy than my own house uses. That's exactly what we want to see. 50 to 70 percent reduction is the goal with a deep energy retrofit. It impressed me just how much impact those projects actually had.\nWhat the Client Says:\nWhat kind of project did you do with Byggmeister? DJ: We had a tenant in our carriage house apartment that was a hoarder, lots of cats, windows were broken, and there was a water problem. When she left, we said we'd fix it up right and make it as sustainable as possible. We asked around about architects and builders who would be sensitive to our goals and that's how we came to Paul. Since then, we have also done more on our main house to make it more energy efficient, including blower door tests to see where we were losing heat. Kerry [Kostinen] is crazy about that stuff. He'll crawl all over an attic and into any crevice to find air leaks.\nWhy use WegoWise? DJ: I kept asking Paul, 'I've got this 8500-square-foot house with 11-foot ceilings, how are we doing with these improvements? I want to be the best you've ever done.' We kept wanting to know how we compared to other Byggmeister projects, but Paul didn't have enough data. Byggmeister is actually entering historical data into WegoWise for us so we can do a more substantial evaluation.\nWhat has WegoWise shown you? DJ: The greatest thing is the monthly feedback loop. I can see that my natural gas use is the biggest contributor to our carbon consumption. I saw that my electricity use came down a lot and then back up, which I figured out is behavior related. It's like buying a certain kind of car for the miles per gallon, I want to know this stuff is making a difference. If you're not getting the savings, then you can hunt down the reason.\nHave you hunted down energy issues in your house? DJ: I'm always asking questions about what's going on. Like when I realized houseguests had caused our electricity consumption to go up because they were leaving lights on. I've also realized the new boiler we had installed is not as efficient as it should be, so I'm having Byggmeister's plumbing contractor come in to look at it. It's all about working to drive my costs down more and seeing it happen. Everyone can do it. In fact, I think homeowners should eventually be able to say to builders, 'I want to see your WegoWise improvement numbers.'\nMore from Our Viewpoint\nLearn more about us\nReview our goals", "id": "<urn:uuid:cb49f900-a037-4a5b-98e2-32db42d32a7c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://byggmeister.com/article_wegowise.shtml", "date": "2013-05-18T05:00:40Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9656515717506409, "token_count": 1054, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Between shutting down the regular season for three weeks to not being able to broadcast highlights thanks to the IOC's strict licensing rules to praying no one gets injured, there's a lot to be concerned with from the league's side.

While in every discussion since 2004 -- our final glimpse of hockey before the last lockout began -- has slotted in a World Cup in its typical late-August/early-September slot on the calendar, there's a chance that it could be moved to fill in dates in future Februarys in non-Olympic years.\nA reborn World Cup, however, would be profoundly different, with the tournament played at prime time for television as well as prime time for hockey — February of every fourth year, alternating with the Olympic Winter Games so hockey fans would have a major international tournament every second year.\n\"We've had those discussions informally,\" confirmed Hockey Canada president Bob Nicholson, who personally supports the initiative. \"It's all about growing all facets of the game.\"\nThe IIHF is reviewing its championship structure and working on a 10-to-12-year plan that is roughly modelled on FIFA (soccer's world governing body) and aimed at increasing international interest in hockey.\nThere's been a lot of support for a return of a hockey World Cup. The tournament was rumored to made a comeback in 2011, but never materialized. In 2010, Toronto Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke penned an editorial saying it's a no-brainer' for everyone involved.

Fixed TrueType Text Width Display/Print in Reference Drawings.\n2. Improved Import of Arcs from AutoCAD DWG files. Especially helpful in import of drawings of the Civil & Survey types.\n3. Improved Import of some Cad text from AutoCAD DWG files.\n4. Fixed Import of some AutoCAD DWG files on Windows NT/2000/XP systems where there are a very large amount of lines and/or polylines in the DWG file which caused a crash when trying to open the DWG on Windows NT/2000/XP.\n5. Improved Export to DWG, in that VWF drawing exports to DWG file without needing a File/Pack/Recalculate, where File/Pack/Recalculate was needed before in some instances (for example if a symbol was newly made in the VWF drawing with the command Symbol/Make, it would be necessary to do a File/Pack/Recalculate).\nThe translator files are:\nadinit.dat ('Modified' date is September 27, 2001)\ndwgxvwf.dll ('Modified' date is June 17, 2003)\nvwfxdwg.dll ('Modified' date is June 17, 2003)\nThe other update files are:\nCad1.dll ('Modified' date of June 17, 2003)\nCADMSG.dll ('Modified' date is June 16, 2003)\nMFCTools.dll ('Modified' date is June 16, 2003)\nCADMSG.dll is a display message dynamic link library file.\nMFCTools.dll is a dynamic link library file involved in control of display and update of messages, tool bars, and status bar.\nThe CADVANCE Build 11.20 CD contains all the improvements of SP2, plus the following improvements:\nWhat’s New in Service Pack 2\nSP2 contains all changes, bug fixes and improvements of SP1, as well as the following improvements:\nNote for AETools users:\n§ AETools 2002 and CADVANCE 2000 share the buffer objects CDI_REFERENCE_DEFN and CDI_REFERENCE_BUF which are used by AEPlan. The buffer objects have maximum 64 character path length.\no Layers from DWG was setting line style and weight to zero in the CADVANCE 2002 original release. It now sets blank like V2000.\n§ This change reflects to Edit/Word as Edit/Word Single and Edit/Word Multiple on the Edit menu as well as mouse right button popup menu.\n1. Translate CADVANCE drawing database in layer order and leave out layers with no data in dwg file. Only the layers that contain data in CADVANCE are output to dwg file.\n2. Create all area filled objects before all other line data in dwg file so that when the dwg file is displayed in other CAD software the date drawn over the filled area (solid) will be displayed . To do this, “Areafill under line” in the Option/Miscellaneous dialog box has to be checked on. Without checked, CADVANCE will display in forward or backward\n3. Multiple layers with the same ‘underscore, underscore, layer number’ setting will end up on the same layer.\n4. The translator setup dialog seems to show up only once per CADVANCE session. In addition to “File / Open … [another] dwg file”, the translator setup dialog now shows up after the Reference Setup Dialog (if translation detected) and for “Utility / Translate …“. This is a bug fix.\n5. When translating DWG files to VWF files using File/Open, now cadvance creates VWF reference files for the XREFs found inside the DWG files.\n6. Fixed tessellation algorithm. We know when to reverse the point-order when handling polygons drawn in clockwise order. Prevented crashes when translating large linesets.\n1. When redrawing the drawing database, draw all area filled objects before all other line data. To do this, “Areafill under line” in the Option/Miscellaneous dialog box has to be checked on. Without checked, CADVANCE will display in forward or backward depending on the setting in the Option/Miscellaneous dialog box.\n2. Fixed problem with clipboard, CADVANCE registry entries were not right in WinXP. This fix is applied only to Windows XP system.\n3. Fixed Reference Setup column spacing so 3 digit layers are not split into two lines.\n4. Fixed Undo/Redo where symbol editing and text attributes are involved.\nThere were cases like: “Symbol attributes are lost when a symbol is edited and then saved with the same name”, and “Symbol text attributes are lost when the user ‘explores’ the undo/redo memory and the text attributes assigned to symbol just go away and cannot be even be re-edited to have any text attributes.” Additionally, the undo/redo playback gets very confusing for the users with symbol editing.

{"text": "There are some products which Chanel puts out that are so inexplicable, I cannot help but buy them just so I can try to understand them. Rachel Zoe recently said in one of her recent Zoe Reports:\nIf you are someone who identifies with the fashion world, you probably have days when people look at you like you’re crazy—I know I do. But never let that discourage you. Anytime you find yourself the subject of a “What on earth is she wearing?” comment, it usually means you are doing your job right!\nChanel Joues Contraste in Luna seems to fit within a level of lunar insanity that makes me wonder, “Who on earth would wear that?” Then I catch a glimpse of a cool luminescence on my cheek in the mirror, and I say “I would!!”\nAlthough labeled as a “blush,” Luna is a most decidedly a platinum-toned highlighter. Unlike Nars Albatross, most Bobbi Brown Shimmerbricks and other highlighters on the market, Luna runs white-silver rather than those that include pinks, peaches or golds. This gives the cheek a high-fashion glow that is very very subtle.\nIf you apply this normally in the upper cheek and forehead area, you may not notice it at first. I found myself squinting into the mirror, finally getting close enough to bump my forehead. At extremely close (ouch!) range, you can barely see a cool multi-toned shimmer. It is only when I came back an hour later, relaxed, stood back and allowed the light to fall naturally on my cheek that I noticed the pretty, glowy highlighting effect.\nGlowy, but not as if you are the moon. Rather, as if you are moonlit.\nHere is a heavy, heavy swatch so that you can see the color. I would not recommend wearing Luna so heavily:\nThere seem to be very few swatches of this blush around. I doubt that product was popular, and it is extremely difficult to impossible to photograph the shimmery effect as a more lightly-applied, wearable state. I find that it looks beautiful with a nude blush used as a contour, with the highlighting Luna on the upper cheek. Clearly, this product is not for everyone. But it was more wearable that I imagined. I suspect that it can be duplicated with a shimmery cool-toned pigment from one of the many etailers out there. Nonetheless, I appreciate that Chanel tried something different with Luna that is a wearable, yet unusual, addition to my makeup.\nAgain, here are some heavy swatches:", "id": "<urn:uuid:29a8b1b4-876b-4a9d-9c1f-908f5b2fd0f8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cafemakeup.com/tag/chanel-joues-contraste-luna/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:32:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9704435467720032, "token_count": 557, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Thursday, November 11, 2010\n10 November '10\nDaniel Halper takes us through some midterm-election polling conducted by J Street on Jews’ views of Obama, Bibi, and Obama’s handling of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. As he points out, there is reason to be skeptical of anything coming out of that outfit. In this case, not surprisingly, J Street’s poll numbers are out of whack with virtually every reputable poll on Jewish opinion.\nJ Street would have us believe that Jews approve of Obama’s performance by a 60 to 40 percent margin, and of his handling of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by a 53 to 47 percent margin. The J Streeters’ pollsters contend that American Jews favor Obama’s over Bibi’s handling of the Palestinian issue (51 percent to 49 percent). Even on its own terms, that’s not a ringing endorsement by overwhelmingly liberal Jews. But are these figures reliable? Let’s see how J Street’s latest offering compares with other polling.\n(Read full post)\nIf you enjoy \"Love of the Land\", please be a subscriber.

{"text": "for sheer exuberance and talent in all areas of jazz vocals. Though three or four outshone her in pure quality of voice, her splendid improvising, wide dynamic tone, and innate sense of rhythm made her the most enjoyable singer of the age.\n's first appearances in a big band shattered the traditional image of a demure female vocalist by swinging just as hard as the other musicians on the bandstand, best heard on her vocal trading with\nrecording \"Let Me Off Uptown.\" After making her solo debut in the mid-'40s, she incorporated bop modernism into her vocals and recorded over a dozen of the best vocal LPs of the era for Verve during the 1950s and '60s. Though hampered during her peak period by heavy drinking and later, drug addiction, she made a comeback and continued singing into the new millennium.\nBorn Anita Belle Colton in Chicago, she was raised largely by her mother, and entered her first marathon-dance contest while barely a teenager. She spent time on the road and occasionally back at home, later moving from dancing to singing at the contests. After bad experiences amid brief tenures with Benny Goodman\nand even Raymond Scott\nearned a place in Gene Krupa\n's band in 1941. Several weeks later, Krupa\nalso hired trumpeter Roy Eldridge\n, and the trio combined to become an effective force, displayed on hits like \"Let Me Off Uptown,\" \"Boogie Blues,\" and \"Just a Little Bit South of North Carolina.\" She spent a brief period away from Krupa\nwith Woody Herman\n, but returned to the band, only to have it break up by 1943. After moving to Stan Kenton\n, she starred on Kenton\n's first big hit, 1944's \"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine.\" Another stint with Krupa\npresaged her solo debut in 1946, and with drummer John Poole\nas her accompanist, she recorded a moderate hit one year later with the novelty \"Hi Ho Trailus Boot Whip.\"\nHer career really ignited after her first album, 1955's Anita\n(also known as This Is Anita\n). Much more successful in the jazz world than she was in its pop equivalent, she performed at jazz festivals and jazz-oriented concerts, appearing with figures including Louis Armstrong\n, Thelonious Monk\n, and George Shearing\n. Her performance at 1958's Newport Jazz Festival made her fame worldwide after being released on a film titled Jazz on a Summer's Day.O'Day\n's series of almost 20 Verve LPs during the '50s and '60s proved her to be one of the most distinctive, trend-setting, and successful vocal artists of the time, arguably surpassed only by Frank Sinatra\nand Ella Fitzgerald\n. She worked with a variety of arrangers and in many different settings, including a hard-swinging Billy May\ncollaboration (Anita O'Day Swings Cole Porter with Billy May\n), an excellent, intimate set with the Oscar Peterson Quartet\n(Anita Sings the Most\n), several with the mainstream Buddy Bregman Orchestra\n(Pick Yourself Up\n), one with the cool-toned Jimmy Giuffre\n), and a Latin date with Cal Tjader\n(Time for Two\n) as well as a collaborative LP with the Blue Note instrumental trio the 3 Sounds\n. Even by the early '60s, however, her ebullient voice had begun sounding tired. The cumulative effects of heroin addiction, its resulting lifestyle, and a non-stop concert schedule forced her into a physical collapse by 1967.\nAfter taking several years to kick alcohol and drug addictions, she made a comeback at the 1970 Berlin Jazz Festival and returned in the early '70s with a flood of live and studio albums, many recorded in Japan and some released on her own label, Emily Records. Her autobiography, 1983's High Times, Hard Times was typically honest and direct regarding her colorful past. Though her voice gradually deteriorated, O'Day\nrecorded throughout the 1970s and '80s, remaining an exciting, forceful vocalist on record as well as in concert. She slowed down considerably during the '90s, and appeared only occasionally. She re-emerged in 2006 with a new album (Indestructible!\n), recorded during the previous two years, but passed away in November of that year due to the effects of pneumonia and advanced Alzheimer's disease.", "id": "<urn:uuid:775333a4-bc0e-43de-a5e7-45bad379c69b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://calgary.virginradio.ca/Music/Artist.aspx?id=36190", "date": "2013-05-18T05:58:27Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9701890349388123, "token_count": 913, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "* original post found on my blog www.inmysewingroom.com*\nWhen my sister and her family moved into their new home this summer she decorated my nephew Donovan's room with a \"transportation” theme so I designed this quilt to go on his bed. After eight months, in December 2010, I completed what I dubbed the Dump Truck quilt (actually called Convoy, from a Buggy Barn pattern). It was originally to be a gift for my nephews 3rd birthday.... but since his birthday was in July that didn’t exactly happen! I pieced most of the blocks in the spring and in the fall I finished sewing the quilt top together.\nIn November I bought a new sewing machine for quilting and began the huge job of quilting a full sized quilt. I spent quite a bit of time searching on-line for the best design to use. I decided to begin with the roads. I did free-motion quilting and made a gravel pattern in circles.\nNext I did a boxy stippling pattern around all the free area’s. It took quite a while but it turned out exactly the way I’d hoped!\nI made a scrappy type binding and I absolutely loved the way it added to the overall look of the quilt. As usual, my two cats were extremely helpful in breaking in the coziness of this quilt while I did the hand sewing on the binding! Gotta love ‘em!\nThe trucks and tractors needed to be quilted as well. So after the binding was done I went back and added stitch-in-the-ditch quilting to the tractors and dump trucks. It was the perfect finish!\nThe best part was giving the quilt to Donovan and seeing the joy in his face when he opened his gift!\nI have to say, I think it was a perfect fit!", "id": "<urn:uuid:a4ee42d8-50ef-444b-a7e1-9fab6078152b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://calgarymodernquiltguild.ning.com/profiles/blogs/dump-truck-quilt", "date": "2013-05-18T05:57:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9881627559661865, "token_count": 402, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Most who sacrifice do it willingly in exchange for some thing or some situation they believe will improve their lives.\nSo too do teachers sacrifice for their students. Teachers give of themselves to improve the quality of life for their students. Whether its through imparting some knowledge, or facilitating a hard lesson in character, teachers give to the students' benefit. But is that a sacrifice on the part of the teacher? What saturating rain, or bountiful harvest or guarantee of protection do teachers get for their personal and costly sacrifice? Better put, what's in it for the teacher? Not much you say? How about those painfully long days without adult interaction? What about the great pay? And don't forget test scores. Well there are those long summers off. That's pretty cool.\nMaybe it's not a sacrifice. Since we do not do what we do for the greater personal return on our investment, then maybe what we do do is not a sacrifice at all. Stay with me here. Perhaps what we are really doing is building the future. Think about it. Who else in the global village (I hate that term) is saddled with the responsibility or churning out well-behaved, disciplined, moral, value-filled, hard-working, freedom loving young adults ready to take on the responsibilities of leading the free world and not blowing the place up? Certainly not television producers, alcohol and cigarette sales people, or movie, sports, and musical talents. No. Charles Barkley said so himself.\nIt's up to the teachers. We are held to a higher standard. I once used the word \"bitchen\" in class to describe a dance that one of my sixth grade students choreographed and shared with me. She went home and shared my enthusiasm with her parents and grandparents. At a parent conference I sat across from a pair of leather-clad parents who explained that it wasn't that they didn't use the word in their own home, but that I was a teacher, and I had to hold the higher ground. It was my first year.\nSo do we sacrifice? Well, not for our personal gain. So, no, we don't sacrifice. I hope that doesn't upset you. I know that martyr is on the list of synonyms for teacher (not really). Here is the list from thesaurus. com : abecedary, advisor, assistant, babysitter, coach, disciplinarian, docent, don, educator, faculty member, governess, grind, guide, guru, instructor, lecturer, maestro, master, mentor, mistress, pedagogue, preceptor, prof, professor, pundit, scholar, schoolman, schoolmaster, schoolmistress, schoolteacher, slave driver, supervisor, swami, teach, trainer, tutor. I think my favorite from that list is \"slave driver.\"\nSo that settles it. We don't sacrifice when we spend hours after school helping kids with make up work for classes that they missed during the day because they slept in late and Mom and Dad couldn't get them to school on time, or at all. We don't sacrifice when we give up our weekends to grade essays written by other people's children trying to help them understand the difference between a noun and pronoun. We don't sacrifice when we can't afford to buy our families they vehicle they need when the students we teach drive to school in BMWs and Porsches. No, that' not sacrifice, that's building the future.\nWow, that's so negative.

{"text": "Dying , and You Should Be Very Worried\nRSS makes it possible for me to check 100s of sites a day. I only actually implicitly go\nand read two, everything else goes through the RSS reader. If I didn’t have RSS then I wouldn’t bother keeping\nan eye on that many sites in the first place. Because me and you—dear technical readers—don’t have to suffer\nthat routine anymore, it’s not reason that everybody else should. Bringing all the news updates straight to the\nuser every day is a great killer feature that vendors should be waving from the fronts of their home pages! Browser\nvendors talk about their software helping users get the most out of the great ’Web; right next to “browsing”,\nRSS should be the second most important feature of browsers!\nImagine for example that on the Chrome home page, where sites you visit often appear, Chrome also was\nfollowing the RSS of these sites in the background, and listing new news items for those sites on the home\npage, all without you having to do anything.\nGoogle Chrome has no RSS reader. It doesn’t even try to render RSS, or even help the user with it in any way. It\ngives less of a crap than a French man smoking\na cigarette in public.\nMozilla will deal the final blow that kills RSS off. In Firefox 4.0, there will be\nno RSS button on the toolbar by\ndefault (it has been moved to the bookmarks menu). Mozilla outright\nrefuse to listen to their users\non this matter.\nThe reason for this is that\nstatistically, only 3%–7% of users use\nthe RSS button on the toolbar. If not enough people use it already, then how many less people are going to use it if\nit’s not there by default? How many regular users customise their toolbar to add a button they barely use?\nMozilla’s mistake here is to associate low usage with user dis-interest. If people don’t use it, the feature\nmust not be necessary…? To my mind if the feature is not being used it’s because it’s badly designed and needs\na rethink. The majority of users are missing out on a wealth of information because it is currently too time\nconsuming to be regular in their habits. If RSS were easier (or even automatic) to discover and use, it would save\nthem hours browsing every day!\nThe problem is the interface, not the technology. Let’s face it, RSS sucks and browser vendors care about it\nalmost as little as they do about CSS printing (hello 10+ year old bugs!)\nWhat does this symbol mean? How many regular users could name this symbol? None, I’d wager. If they know that this\nsymbol means “RSS”, then what does “RSS” mean; how many users can explain that? Users are already adverse to\nclicking things they don’t understand so what do they think this symbol will do to their computer when it is not\nobvious a) what it is, and what it stands for, or b) what happens when it’s clicked? Will a dialogue box open?\nWill it ask questions? Will it print something? Will it ask for a name and password?\nThis symbol gives absolutely zero clue as to why it is present, what functionality it represents and how the user is\nsupposed to use it.\nThe browser RSS button is the worst piece of UI since 2004.\nThis is a serious problem because a regular user understands Facebook and Twitter better than they understand RSS,\nand when browser vendors push RSS so far to the sidelines, companies will respond by replacing RSS with Twitter and\nIf RSS isn’t saved now, if browser vendors don’t realise the potential of RSS to save users a whole bunch of\ntime and make the web better for them, then the alternative is that I will have to have a Facebook account,\nor a Twitter account, or some such corporate-controlled identity, where I have to “Like” or\n“Follow” every website’s partner account that I’m interested in, and then have to deal with the privacy\nviolations and problems related with corporate-owned identity owning a list of every website I’m interested in\n(and wanting to monetise that list), and they, and every website I’m interested in, knowing every other website\nI’m interested in following, and then I have to log in and check this corporate owned identity every day\nin order to find out what’s new on other websites, whilst I’m advertised to, because they are only interested in\nmaking the biggest and the best walled garden that I can’t leave.\nIf RSS dies, we lose the ability to read in private\nWe lose the ability for one website we read to not know what other websites we read\nWe lose the ability for a website operator to be in control of what he advertise to his users,\nrather than having no control over the aggregator’s “value add”. If Facebook, Twitter and\nGoogle are the ones making the money on adverts attached to another website’s content, then\nwhere does that leave the website owner to pay for producing the content?\nWe lose the ability for websites to push updates to us on their own terms and infrastructure,\nrather than through closed APIs and flavour-of-the-month platforms. A website should be free to\noperate on the web without the requirement of additional unwanted accounts that need to be updated\nand managed and adhered to. If every website on the web has to have a Facebook account in order to\nexist in practical terms, the web is dead—competition is dead\nEvery website should not look like a NASCAR advert for every sharing service in\nexistence. One RSS button should do everything\nWe lose the ability for us to aggregate, mash-up and interpret news without having to go through a\nclosed API that may change on a whim, or disagree with our particular usage\nWe lose a common standard by which content can be aggregated. A developer should not have to be\nfluent in Twitter, Facebook and a million different private APIs just to aggregate content from\ndifferent websites you read\nYou should be writing to Mozilla, Google, Microsoft and all browser vendors to demand a first-class RSS experience\nbaked in to your browser so well your grandmother could use it.\nRSS Is the Browser’s Responsibility\nMore than one person has already said that I’m somehow hypocritical because my website doesn’t have RSS, it\ndoes have RSS! (here) You are probably not seeing it because of the very\nproblem I’m talking about! Browser vendors are hiding RSS auto-discovery to the point nobody is aware it exists. I\ndon’t have an RSS button in my HTML because it’s in the\n<head> and it’s up to the browser\nto do the best thing based on the user interface, operating system and device.\nThere isn’t enough screen space on mobiles for every website to use their own RSS button. Relying on the web\nauthor to present RSS is not going scale. Too many different websites, too many different designs, too many\ndifferent platforms, browsers and devices. It is far better if browser vendors do what is most appropriate\nto the browser’s user interface, that the website itself can’t see, can’t change.\nThere appears to be a distinct lack of imagination going on with RSS. RSS does not have to be RSS shaped and look\nlike RSS and do RSS things.\nWhy can’t, when you visit a blog article, the browser reads the comments RSS, and when you next come back to that\narticle, it can tell you that there have been new comments since, and highlight them on the page?\nWhy do we go through the same daily routine of checking certain sites over and over again? Can’t our computers be\nmore intelligent here? Isn’t the purpose of the computer / browser to save us time!? Why doesn’t the browser,\nwhen you open it, tell you how many new items there are, on what sites you commonly visit, without you having ever\nYou cannot do that with a web app like Google Reader. It cannot look at your whole browsing history like the browser\ncan. It cannot tie together your bookmarks and RSS. It cannot make decisions for you based on what other sites on\nthe web you visit often enough. Only the browser knows everything about you, and tries to prevent one website\nknowing what other websites you’ve been on. Only the browser is central and trust-worthy enough to be aggregating\nyour information without fears of beaming it to advertisers. Only the browser can join the dots and empower the\nuser, rather than entrap them.\nWhen Mozilla release Firefox 4, then RSS auto-discovery moves out of sight from the most popular modern browsers.\nIE9 will add HTML5 (allowing IE users to see my site for the first time), but follow suit in removing the RSS button\nfrom view. I will be forced to add RSS hyperlinks to my HTML, which clutters up my website and links to a dumb page\nthat doesn’t do anything helpful, or just doesn’t display at all. It confuses users, it wastes space and\nworse—it’s a really stupid way to be handling such incredible time-saving technology that should be part of\nevery users’s daily interaction with their browser.\nWhat Can Be Done\nI’m open to fair representation, and actually quite honoured to have Mozilla’s Asa Dotzler defend Firefox on my\nHow about spending the same energy you did on this rant coming up with a better design for RSS features and\nsubmitting it to the browser vendors who accept feature requests?\nThis, I always knew would be the open retort, which is why I had staved off from writing this article until this\npoint where I was finally too sick and tired to hold it back. I owe it to myself to put forward some good\nsuggestions and will make it my aim to do so in due time.\nYour post suggests over and over rss auto-discovery is being killed when it isn’t. You no more today have\nto add an RSS button to your page than you did a year ago. The UI for RSS has actually improved with a menu\nitem that makes it clear what RSS is “subscribe”.\nRSS never had a button in the toolbar. It had an icon in the addressbar. Now it has a full menu item in the\nbookmarks menu with a clear description of what it is “subscribe.” something it lacked before and which\nmakes it far more discoverable than the little orange chicklett in the addressbar.\nYour rant is misplaced. Mozilla, with the creation of live bookmarks and the first high-profile placement\nof the rss icon has done more to promote RSS than any other piece of desktop software. The UI, as it was\n— a tiny orange button in the addressbar wasn’t helping users use the feature so it was removed. Better\nUI, a menu item with a real description of what RSS does, “subscribe” replaced it. That’s a positive\nstep, not a negative one. Though it may be encountered by fewer users, it will make much more sense to\nthose who do encounter it.\nLive bookmarks, the best RSS feature implementation I've seen to date in a web browser, is still there.\nAuto-discovery and a “subscribe” menu item is there. Mozilla has improved the design of RSS and\nyou’re ranting as if they’ve killed it.\nMy only response to this at this time is simply that what exists in current browsers isn’t enough. E-mail was once\ninaccessible to regular folks, now it’s an essential part of their day. I believe that RSS can also be every bit\nas important as a tool for browser intelligence to make the web easier and more user-centric.\nThank you to everybody who has spread this article about, it got a very large amount of attention\nand I hope some good has come of it.

Everything seems ready, but its doors have remained locked and calls to the establishment have gone unanswered.\nDom Mazzetti is accomplished for a college super senior. He has a passion for girls, partying and working out, an accent reminiscent of Jersey Shore, and more than 25 million views total on YouTube and more than 76,000 likes on Facebook.\nIn celebration of Cinco Dom Mayo, I mean de Mayo, The Barking Dog brought this Internet phenom to Route 1.\nBecause the bar’s managers expected 500 people to crowd the Barking Dog on Saturday, they hired three extra security hands for the night — only 50 people showed up.\n“It was embarrassingly small,” said senior economics major Bret Greer. “You would think for Cinco de Mayo, more people would be out.”\nBy now, no student can deny watching and endlessly quoting the addicting Dom Mazzetti videos. The series created by Mike Tornabene and Gian Hunjan nearly went viral on YouTube. Each new episode, titled “Dom vs. …..”, would feature Dom Mazzetti, a full-blown airhead, taking on different aspects of college life. The most popular videos include Dom Mazzetti vs. Drunk Girls and Dom Mazzetti vs. Freshman.\nWhile the videos do use explicit language and content, they are wildly funny and relatable to students around the country, which could be due to the fact that in each episode Dom is miraculously enrolled at a different university. Dom was even a student at Maryland in one episode, Dom Mazzetti vs. Resumes, where he hopelessly works to create a resume to get a job after graduating “MarryLand.”\nThis weekend, Mike and Gian have the chance to interact with real Maryland students at the Barking Dog for Cinco de Mayo. It could very well be the wildest night of the semester, with free merchandise, shots, an ice luge and plenty of other giveaways. If you’re wearing a Route One Apparell “Cinco DOM Mayo” shirt, you’ll receive VIP access and drink specials all night.\nThe event starts at 10 p.m. but get there early if you hope to get in at all, as the event page already has 471 listed attendees.

Be MarryLand.\n— Becky Kaminsky is a freshman journalism major and student blogger for The Diamondback\nIn January, Kayla Libby was excitedly preparing for a trip to help build the Pimentera Elementary School in Honduras when she suddenly fell ill and was forced to stay behind.\nAbout a week after her fellow Students Helping Honduras member returned from the trip, Libby — a sophomore public health major — passed away unexpectedly Jan. 21 at Marlborough Hospital in Massachusetts.\nThree months later, members of SSH and Libby’s sorority sisters in Alpha Omicron Pi came together Sunday afternoon for a 5K HonduRUN to honor Libby’s memory and raise $3,000 for the cause she was so passionate about in life.\nIt was a scene out of a Publishers Clearing House commercial at the bus stop in front of Stamp Student Union yesterday afternoon.\nFor those of you who haven’t seen a PCH commercial, they usually involve the PCH Prize Patrol driving a van up to houses in an undisclosed neighborhood and surprising a lucky person with an obscenely large check and balloons, while Lizzie McGuire’s favorite songs play in the background.\nReplace “Prize Patrol” with “DOTS staff,” “driving a van” with “walking” and “house” with “Shuttle-UM bus,” and you have the Department of Transportation Services’ 3 millionth rider celebration, complete with background music.\nFreshman psychology major Demi Kleeman was on her way to her Wednesday poetry class when the bus she was riding rolled up to the curb outside Stamp, where 25 DOTS staff members had been waiting for more than an hour for the Shuttle-UM rider meter to hit 3 million.\nI’ll be the first to admit: Half the time my peers or promoters are handing out fliers on the campus, I ignore them. This is one flier I’m glad I grabbed.\nOn Thursday, College Electro will be presenting Electric Circus at Fur Nightclub, sponsored by Route One Apparel. Fur has events all the time, but this is one you definitely don’t want to miss. Music will be blasting throughout the live sets of Meerical, DJ Dovgi, DJ Rew!nd, DJ Tannenbaum, and DJ Ev0lution.\nAll-night drink specials include beers, rails and shooters for $3 each. However, if you’re not 21, don’t worry. The entire event is 18 and up.\nMost students by now are familiar with Sweetgreen, the health food restaurant founded in Washington by three college students that recently opened a popular location on Route 1 under the University View apartment complex. The restaurant attracts students who are sick of not being able to identify any of the ingredients in dining hall food (Did anyone see last week’s “chicken parmesan sandwich”? I mean, really).\nOn April 28, Sweetgreen is presenting its annual event, the Sweetlife Food & Music Festival, which is being called “a party with a purpose.” The event boasts delicious and healthy food, two stages and a combination of headliners that could only be dreamt up after a long night at Cornerstone.\nFor this week’s installment of Campus Complainer, I had some wrath reserved for the whiners polluting the Art Attack Facebook event. Now that I’ve got bigger fish to fry, I’ll keep it brief. Quit your bellyaching over B.oB. You don’t like him? I’ve got a simple solution for you: Get hammered before. Drink a bunch of beers and BOOM! Then you won’t care who’s on stage. You’d probably dance to Dr. Z singing Nickelback all night anyways.

Most of the time, I’m a big fan of College Park, but yesterday my tides turned.\nIf you’re looking to stay local this weekend, the Barking Dog is the place for you.\nYou’ve likely seen the scattered chalk drawings on the sidewalk or on the sides of various building, so now is your chance to fulfill your curiosity: Tonight, HandsDownMusic is presenting Ground Up with Michael Cameron & Uno Hype at the Barking Dog.\nIt was just a typical night at Looney’s Pub and the usual crowd shuffled through the doors seeking a drink or a plate of chicken wings.\nBut Monday, 15 people — all except one of whom were students — walked out of the bar as newly registered voters, ready to make their voices heard in the upcoming elections.\nThe J. Franklyn Bourne Bar Association — a coalition dedicated to advancing African Americans in legal professions — hosted the voter registration drive at Looney’s alongside members of the League of Women Voters. The university’s African Students Association, Black Student Union and Terps for Obama also co-sponsored the event.\nJohn Webster, a junior communication major and president of Terps for Obama, said the goal of the drive was to increase student participation in their government, especially among minorities.\n“Students don’t often know that they can have their opinion out there and that it really does matter,” Webster said. “It’s important that they elect politicians who they feel will benefit them the most and stand up for what they believe in. Registering to vote is the first step towards making that happen.”\nHowever, getting students to sign on to register was no easy task. Looney’s owners even offered free chicken wings to incentivize people to sign up.\n“The biggest issue is that students don’t want to commit the time to register,” Webster said.\nSophomore letters and sciences major Cameron Mitchell, one of the students who registered at Looney’s, said she’s excited to vote in the upcoming election.\n“I want to vote so I can have a say,” she said. “You can’t complain about what’s going on in the country if you didn’t make an effort to change it.”\n— Madeleine List", "id": "<urn:uuid:75046213-6b65-4785-a339-541a5f71104c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://campusdrivedbk.wordpress.com/category/this-great-city/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:40Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9476303458213806, "token_count": 1927, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Pew Report: Young Voters Played Bigger Role In 2012 Than Expected\nWhile Obama’s national support among young voters was slightly down from 2008 when they supported him by 2 to 1 margin, a closer look reveals that his 2012 victory was even more dependent on the Millennial vote. The reason? In 2012, Obama narrowly lost voters 30 and older (a group he won in 2008) to Romney, 48-50. With that shift, he needed a boost from young voters much more than he did in 2008, and they came through for him, especially in the critical swing states where the race was closest: Ohio, Virginia, Florida, and Pennsylvania.\nIn each of those four states Obama lost among voters over 30 but won 60 percent or greater support from young voters.\nAdditionally, the overall, youth share of the electorate was up from 18 percent in 2008 to 19 percent in 2012. The increase is noteworthy not only because all signs leading up to the election pointed to a smaller showing from young voters than in 2008, but also because the total number of young people eligible to vote is up substantially. About 16 million young people turned 18 in the last four years, and as Millennials continue to come of age, their political power will only increase.\nA big shift happened in the final weeks before the election (just as in 2008), when interest surged among young voters, who once more came out in force to support Obama.\nHowever, the president’s support among young voters was not absolute. Indeed, the unprecedented level of diversity among Millennials was a key factor in his carrying the demographic overall. Obama’s support was highest among African-American and Latino voters generally and so the fact that so many young voters are among these groups was critical to the president’s success with Millennials. As Pew states:\nHis losses among young voters since 2008 might have been even greater, but for the fact that the under 30s are by far the most racially and ethnically diverse age group. Just 58% are white non-Hispanic, compared with 76% of voters older than 30.\nAs we’ve written previously, Millennials strongly support progressive values and policies, which is another reason Obama did so well with them again this year. And as they continue to make up more of the electorate, we’ll see more and more of these kinds of policies enacted and expanded. The key issues that Pew identifies as having strong support from young people include:\n- 59 percent believe the government should do more.\n- 53 percent support expanding or maintaining Obamacare.\n- 68 percent believe undocumented immigrants should be given a chance to achieve legal status.\n- 64 percent believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n- 66 percent believe their state should legalize marriage equality.\n- 61 percent believe the U.S. economic system favors the wealthy.\nWith each new election cycle, the importance of young voters will grow and it will be harder and harder for candidates who reject these values to succeed. Millennials are the new electoral reality and will play an increasingly large role in every election for decades to come.\nAbraham White is a communications associate at Campus Progress.

{"text": "LMS | News\nBlackboard Buys Out Moodlerooms, NetSpot\n- By David Nagel, Dian Schaffhauser\nBlackboard is buying out two major players in the open source services space: Moodlerooms and NetSpot. Blackboard has also brought onboard Sakai Project founding architect Charles Severance. With these additions, the company is also launching its own open source division: Blackboard Education Open Source Services.\nMoving into Open Source Services\nTeams from both Moodlerooms and NetSpot will make up Blackboard's new open source group. Both of those companies provide commercial services for institutions that use Moodle, including support, consulting, installation, and hosting services.\n\"Both Moodlerooms and NetSpot have built strong reputations for high quality service and support, which aligns with our deep focus in these areas and our overall commitment to providing LMS services and hosting globally,\" said Henderson, CTO and president of academic platforms at Blackboard, in a prepared statement. \"This direction allows us to provide the choice of an open source alternative with the benefit of a team of leaders from the open source community to guide our sustained contributions and citizenship in that community.\"\n\"This partnership is an historic moment for our company, our clients and the open source community,\" said Pugliese, CEO of the Moodlerooms, also in a prepared statement. \"Our company organizes around the principles of affordability, openness and sustainability. Working with Blackboard means that clients using one or more LMS systems can do so more affordably, with greater investment in interoperability and deeper integration between products. Our work will also continue to send a significant portion of revenue directly to Moodle's core team to help support the improvement of a free and open product.\"\nAccording to Blackboard, \"Leaders from Moodlerooms, NetSpot and Blackboard signed a Statement of Principles affirming that their work will continue to include regular contributions to the open source community in the form of code contributions, financial support to the Moodle Trust, and support for community gatherings including Moodlemoots.\"\n\"The decision of Moodlerooms and NetSpot to work under Blackboard may sound very strange at first to anyone in this industry,\" said Martin Dougiamas, founder of Moodle and managing director of Moodle Pty Ltd., in a statement released today by Blackboard, \"but it's my understanding that these three companies have some good plans and synergies. I'm happy to say that Moodlerooms and NetSpot will remain Moodle Partners, and have promised to continue providing Moodle services, participating in the community, and contributing financially to Moodle exactly as they always have.\"\nNot everybody will be thrilled by the news that Blackboard has bought Moodlerooms. Keystone College is just now completing its transition to Joule, Moodlerooms' online platform. \"I have mixed feelings on the acquisition of Moodlerooms by Blackboard,\" said Kurt Sussman, director of educational technology. \"While I feel that having the backing and resources of a large educational service provider could be beneficial to Moodlerooms and ultimately its customers, I am also concerned because dissatisfaction with the product and less-than-optimal customer service and support is why our institution moved from Blackboard to Moodlerooms in the first place.\" The Pennsylvania college reported it expects to shut down its Blackboard server \"for good\" May 31, 2012.\nLMS competitors are also assessing the move by Blackboard into the open source space. Josh Coates, CEO of Instructure, which develops the Canvas LMS, said he views the acquisition as Blackboard's decision to \"give up on innovation\" and focus on the commoditizing of the LMS. \"Moodle, Sakai, Angel, Blackboard 9.1--it's all the same to them now,\" he said. \"They want to make their money by offering generic IT service and software. Given Blackboard's decline in LMS market share, I suppose it's the only option they had.\"\nBlackboard Looks to Sakai\nBlackboard is also eyeing the Sakai marketplace, although Henderson declined to provide specifics. The company has appointed Charles Severance as chief Sakai strategist to head up its Sakai initiatives. Severance previously served as executive director of the Sakai Foundation and was the founding chief architect of the Sakai Project. He's currently a board member of the Sakai Foundation, and he serves as clinical associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information.\nReferring to Severance as a \"cultural ambassador,\" Henderson said he would act as a \"guide\" into the Sakai community and help Blackboard assemble its technology team \"as we plan our investment and future offerings.\"\n\"We're excited to welcome Chuck to our team,\" said Blackboard CEO Michael Chasen. \"He's been a tireless leader in the learning technology and standards communities, and he brings a tremendous amount of expertise and insight that will be critical to our support for institutions using Sakai.\"\nSeverance has been an advocate for open standards in education technology and has worked closely with the IMS Global Learning Consortium as part of that work. The Consortium, which promotes open standards in education technology, was the primary client of Blackboard in its earliest days. Since then, the company has participated in multiple standards initiatives managed by the Consortium.\n\"Blackboard is doing some extraordinary work and challenging preconceived notions of how companies can add real value to the industry,\" said Severance. \"I'm looking forward to leveraging Blackboard's new focus and investment in open source to bring new value to institutions using Sakai.\"\n|Editor's note: This article has been modified since its original publication to include additional details and quotes.

I do agree that $1mm is not what it used to be and really only provides about $40,000 in income if you retire in your 50's.

I will be in a similar position as you at that age, but right now I am at the beginning of the journey and I am getting all kinds of advice from different directions. For example, my family wants me to invest in real estate but I know deep down that I would not enjoy or even have time to be a landlord (I love REITs though). So I am curious about what others in a similar situation are doing.\nOriginally Posted by Jon_Snow\nLast edited by Dave; 2012-04-22 at 07:45 PM.\n2012-04-22, 09:19 PM\nI agree with alot of these things, its not that difficult with a good income and partner. That's pretty much what we did was focus on the careers in the beginning, and held off on kids until we were established. This gave us alot more choices in terms of when returning (if we decided) after maternity leaves. However, I have to disagree with the stay at home part after the kids come, that's a lifestyle choice, not a financial one. In fact, it can be a bad financial one if you have held off having kids until you are established. That's a side point though.\nOriginally Posted by 1.5M\nI also can't figure out how some one saves 50% of their GROSS income. If you are in a higher income bracket and are paying over 40% taxes, you would have to live on under 15% of your gross income. That seems pretty sparse (I know doable)\n2012-04-22, 09:41 PM\nI don't quite understand the obsession from some to have a million by 40, it really isn't that much to live off of, and if you choose to have kids, then I don't think I would feel comfortable retiring with 3 times that amount until my kids are our of school.\nWe hit our the magic number in our early thirties (I think 32 to be exact), this included our primary residence. We dropped to just below that number during the market crash. Right now, we're really close to that number again, not including our primary residence, because we choose to liquidate some investments and pay off our mortgage last year. Honestly, I don't think we've 'made it', nor do I feel like we have very much, or our close to our goals.\nOur focus early on was not to make a million but really just to focus on establishing our carreers and our skills as much as possible. Both my partner and I finished university, and got jobs right away (not anything close to 50K at the time). I focused on developing skills and learning as much as I could to get promoted, money was and still is always secondary. My spouse realized that climbing the corporate ladder wasn't for him, so decided to consult. He gave up stability for a higher income. I continued climbing the ladder until we had kids.\nWe weren't always the best savers, but did always save a small amount, and paid off our debt (mortgage) as fast as possible. We increased our savings to match every promotion or raise we received by at least the same percertage. I do all the investing for us, and will admit, that I can be somewhat of a gambler (not in a good way like Marina), so I had that offset by getting an advisor that I really trust. I know that I pay higher fees, but have to admit, as of right now, I'm okay with that. He does our investing for the long term that is a more reasonable, safer approach. I have been with him, since I started investing at 21.\nWe lived off of mostly my salary, and the play money and savings money came from my partners consulting, which was less stable. We managed to save a larger down payment about 38% down at the time. My partner also had a condo which we kept and rented out. We made sure that we could pay the mortgage and bills off of my lower, but more stable income. We used his consulting as extra payments, and for our high risk investments.\nI have a two fold 'investment' strategy. First is, that I have someone that I trust to manage my 'safe' investments aka the ones for retirement. Like I said before, he is a good balance for my personality. The plan we have with him will have us in good shape for retirement if nothing else happens. My second strategy is to take my gambles. I do 'week' trading (not quite as frequent as day trading, and my own little thing), I have had opportunities to invest in starts up which are very high risk, and overall have done well for me, but have lost all my investments at times. I am willing to take much higher risks, because I know we are well on our track to retirement with our advisor and other real estate. . Anything I invest outside of this, I have always been willing to take the gamble and lose it all.\nI really feel that the best investment one can make is in themselves.\n2012-04-23, 08:42 PM\nI don't understand why would anyone willingly pay 40% taxes, no mater the income bracket.

Do you follow the idea of buying a good company at a good value and holding on?\n2012-04-24, 07:36 PM\nLow and highs are relative. When the stock market is low, usually deflation is also going on in the real world. Therefore if you with draw the money and spend it on certain item that has fallen more than the stock itself, you still earned money. Just as the opposite, as stock market rise, inflation increases and things are more expensive. A better metric is Sell high when the stock in particular rose relative to the targeted purchase you want.\nThe math being taken cared of, let's get to the psychology of buy low and sell high. What is high? You cannot possibly know that. Apple at $300 was pretty high and expensive, but was it a \"bad\" high? Bear Sterns was a great buy at $10 and the after market inside information that you just heard about them finding a buyer was amazing on that fateful day. But did you know the buyout price was $2?\nBuy, when you know that the chance of going higher, (due to all the circumstances helping a stock) is greater than the chance of going lower. Accounting fraud (and any associated politically correct managerial speak) is -10%, bankruptcy is -10000% bad earnings is -5% good earnings is +3% etc. Bet on the trend will continue when the sum of all the points points to a significant sway in one direction.\nYou hold, only when the stock is performing exactly as you predicted. You sell when it does not and have fallen off your previously set target \"GET ME OUT\" price.\nYou hold even more firmly when it is outperforming but only if it is out performing the average.", "id": "<urn:uuid:869b9b1f-ba90-47ed-8184-7b0c82978c14>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://canadianmoneyforum.com/showthread.php/11215-How-to-MAKE-a-million-bucks!/page11", "date": "2013-05-18T05:25:29Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9804731607437134, "token_count": 1931, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Noise", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Last week a couple of us Canadian Online Gamer staffers were invited to EA Canada to attend the annual EA Sports open house. It was two days of sports games, and one of those games was FIFA 13. We had an opportunity to preview the game for the first time back in April and you can check out that in-depth write-up HERE.\nSince our first preview EA Sports has continued to work on FIFA 13 in preparation for its launch later this year. We were treated to a recap of what was discussed back in April and how the FIFA development team continues to move forward. Of course one of the biggest things that was reinforced was that they wanted to continue to make the game “predictably unpredictable”. In other words, they want the user to experience that anything can happen and no single result is guaranteed when playing a match in FIFA 13.\nOne of the new things discussed was the FIFA 13’s social network. They will be offering a virtual rewards program including the EA Sports Football Club Catalogue. Here you can unlock boots, balls, kits, and even unlock other play modes. This rewards program, which is engrained into the game’s social network, continues to highlight EA Sports mantra of “Always Connected”. Of interest to you FIFA 12 online gamers is that your level and XP from FIFA 12 will be carried over to FIFA 13 and you can continue to earn more as you play FIFA 13. This is a nice little touch as it allows you diehard FIFA 12 online players to keep what you have already earned, and you won’t have to start from scratch.\nOne of the big FIFA 13 unveils that we were treated to during the open house was a brand new Career Mode. Santiago Jaramillo, who is a Game Modes Producer on the title, told us that one of the biggest requests that gamers have is to allow them to play for a club and country of their own choice. In FIFA 13’s career mode a focus on Internationals is now a key gameplay item as their wish has been granted.\nAs you play through your career mode you can now play all international friendlies, and you can play in the Euro Championship, World Championship, or any championship that is available to your club. It is something that has been requested for quite a long time, and now you have the opportunity to do this. It was also mentioned that the international matches that will be made available to you is dependent on the prestige and success level of your club of choice.\nAs you “Play as a Player” you will find that there is a fair amount of depth in your management of your team. Something that was highlighted here is that club loans now play a big role. Should you start your career on a high profile team, and your skill level is not that high, you will be “loaned out”, with the hope that you become a better player, and then returned to your club at a later time. Should you turn down a loan offer you risk not being proposed a new loan offer from another team for an extended period of time (virtually speaking of course). It is truly a management based experience and something a lot of FIFA fans should appreciate.\nAnother feature that has been improved during the Career Mode is transfers. This aspect has been worked on to make it a more lifelike experience. The development team has re-written the transfer logic and made things more true to what would happen in real life experiences. You’ll find true market value, counter offers, as well as player & cash transactions. It was quite amazing to see how the game is going to make things seem more true to what actually happens in the various soccer leagues, and you’ll have to put your “thinking cap” on more then a few times in order to make some smart decisions in this area.\nAaron McHardy, who is a Gameplay Producer, came on stage to introduce all of us to something new, and something I think is very much needed in a game like FIFA 13: Skill Games. These skill games are tutorials that allow any level of user to learn, or master, the FIFA fundamentals. Given they are games, they are fun. There are 8 disciplines for you to learn, and there are 4 types of games within each discipline. At this juncture in the game’s development there are a total of 32 different games for you to play, and they all allow you how to play the game at various levels of skill. The four different skill levels (bronze, silver, gold and skill challenge) gradually teach you the intricacies of each discipline, such as passing, shooting, crossing, dribbling, corner kicks, etc. They become progressively harder for each level. These games also have leaderboards and XP as well, so you can compete against friends or worldwide leaders, and you’ll earn in-game XP.\nWe had a chance to play a few of these Skill Games and I have to say that they are something that is not only welcomed, but also in a way needed. They really do start out with the basics of each discipline and as you progress through the skill levels you will learn how to do more complex things. I had fun learning the basics and slowly being introduced to the more complex moves which adds modifiers (other button presses) the mix. This is a great thing for rookies to the series as well as for those fans of the franchise who have yet to master all the disciplines in the game as they are not just tutorials, but skill games that are a quite fun.\nOverall we continue to be impressed with the strides being made as the development of FIFA 13 continues, as each time we play the game, I have to say that I get a bit more excited for what looks to be another solid entry into this long running franchise. Keep your eyes here on COG as we continue to get more opportunities to play FIFA 13 leading up to the release this September. Until then feel free to check out the screenshots below showing a bit of everything, including the new modes mentioned in this article.", "id": "<urn:uuid:28105f92-6a4f-44b8-8d19-aaca40159916>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://canadianonlinegamers.com/preview/fifa-13-hands-on-preview-career-mode-and-skill-games/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:49:22Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9816991090774536, "token_count": 1248, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "- Single Player\n- Wii Remote\n- Classic Controller\nWhen I first heard there was a very popular Japanese RPG called “Xenoblade Chronicles” coming to North America, I was very interested but at the same time very cautious. After all, I have been let down many times before with RPG’s that simply failed to deliver. So needless to say, I wanted Xenoblade to be one of those RPG experiences that not only wets my RPG appetite but delivers one of those unforgettable experiences you can play for months on end. Fortunately Xenoblade Chronicles does all that and more.\nThe game begins with explaining how before the world was created, a never ending battle raged between two giants: the Mechonis and the Bionis. As the millennia passes, their lifeless corpses were forever locked in battle with the Bionis becoming a land where life grew and the eventual home to the humanoids known as the Hom. Unfortunately, the Hom’s existence became threatened by mechanical beings known as the Mechon, an army of machines originating from the Mechonis. A fierce battle between the Homs and the Mechon was fought and won by the hero Dunban, a Hom who was the only one able to wield a mighty and mysterious sword known as the Monado that can defeat the Mechon. With the use of the sword, Dunban and the Homs were victorious but at the cost of Dunban’s arm which became nearly useless.\nOne year later, a young researcher named Shulk and his friends are living in Colony 9 in peace until they are unexpectedly attacked by the Mechon. Dunban attempts to use the Monado but is too weak to do so, requiring Shulk to take up the sword and drive the Mechon threat away. Throughout the course of the battle, his childhood friend Fiora is apparently killed by “Metal Face,” the leader of the Mechon. Swearing vengeance, Shulk and his friend Reyn travel to the other colonies to find Metal Face and avenge Fiora and unravel the secrets of the Monado. Throughout his travels, Shulk begins to unlock the mysteries of the Monado and gain powers including the ability to briefly foresee the future which helps him change events before they happen such as saving his friends.\nThe element of friendship is a predominant theme as Shulk and his friend’s battle enemies, take on quests and solve problems for NPCs. These relationships are measured in the form of “Affinity” which affects how you are perceived by others and increases the ability to work together in battle. More importantly, having Affinity between characters reveals a level of the relationship that otherwise may not be seen. If certain conditions are met, players can also experience “Heart to Hearts” which are situations marked on the playing field that further reveal and develop the relationship between characters by the conversations they share. All of this is intended to add character development and give more background on subplots that may otherwise not be revealed.\nAs mentioned, one of the ways players can develop Affinity within your party is battling together. Using the team leader in your party, you target an enemy using the “Z” button. Once you target the enemy that is within range, it reveals its enemy level and thus the level of difficulty required to defeat it. For example, if the leader and my group are about levels 15 or 16, it will be nearly impossible in defeating an enemy that is a level 75. In fact, you may even have some trouble defeating enemies or creatures that are only one level above you as sometimes they attack in groups.\nIf you decide to engage the enemy, you have the option of initializing an Auto Attack, cancelling the attack, or running away. If you choose Auto Attack, your character automatically fights the enemy with the weapon in hand if they are close enough. Another option is to select a number of “Arts” which are unique abilities that differ from character to character and range from special attacks, healing, increasing a player or team’s defence or offence, guarding, and decreasing the “aggro ring,” which is a ring surrounding a character indicating the enemy has focused its attack on you. Once you select and use an Art, a cool down period is required before it can be used again. More powerful Arts known as “Talent Arts” can also be used but are only available after using enough Auto-Attacks.\nIf your characters is successful in attacking and landing enough critical hits, your group morale or Affinity bar in the top left of your screen increases until it is full and a blue line appears that connects all of you like a chain. This signifies that you can perform a chain attack. When you initiate a chain attack, time stops and you control each player to select a corresponding “Art” in order to form a combination attack against the enemy. If each following “Art” corresponds with the following one, the longer the chain and more effective the attack becomes.\nAs previously mentioned, Shulk has the ability to foresee the future and this power is also integrated into the battle sequences by “seeing” the enemy perform a special attack before it occurs, enabling Shulk to either help his friends, avoid or guard himself from it. Considering battles are dynamic events, you can warn, encourage and sometimes revive fallen characters while in battle mode. You can also create some basic commands to your teammates such as focusing your attacks on one enemy, falling back to the leader or attacking at will.\nAfter a battle is complete, Shulk and his party steadily recover their health and earn experience points to level up. Levelling up causes your characters to become stronger, have more health points and enable you to add points towards the “Art” of your choice and thereby strengthening that “Art” to become more powerful. Any spoils from the battle can also be collected at this time and can range from various materials, weapons, armour and other items. Better equipment can also be bought and sold from shops you encounter in your travels where you can customize your character to how you see fit. Changes to a character’s clothing are visible in gameplay as well as in cut scenes.\nExploring the land in Xenoblade Chronicles is impressive and you are free to explore most areas from the start of the game. The land is so large that according to the games director, the world is about the size of the Japanese archipelago. I have to admit, just exploring Shulk’s home colony was surprisingly big and running around the open world environment was almost overwhelming. Unlike other RPGs, you can fall off a path and sustain damage. A mini-map is available at the top corner of the screen and a larger map is also available in a separate screen. Since the world is so large, you can conveniently jump to landmarks that you have come across instead of manually running everywhere. If you decide to run or walk, an arrow on the top of your screen directs you which way to go and the distance required in travelling it.\nOf course exploring the land is fun especially when you come across some powerful, high level creatures that are just roaming around. Some were so enormous that they rival some of the games bosses. When I saw these creatures, I looked forward to the day where I would be powerful enough to return and defeat it. It should be noted not all of the creatures in the game will attack you without provocation and some will leave you alone. The creatures also vary in attack, speed and agility with some flying like dragonflies or others working in packs like lions. The Mechon (the mechanical beings) use laser beams, fire, or choose to crush you with their arms.\nNeedless to say, this game has depth. Just when you think you have got a handle on things and how the game works, a tutorial menu pops up explaining another feature of the game that you haven’t accessed until that point. These pop ups were handy as it can be a lot of information to take in. If you do become confused, there is an accessible help feature that explains elements of the game as well as providing reminders of the current task or quest at hand. All of this comes together pretty nicely with the on-board menu system where you can quickly look at your available items, your “Arts” and skill trees, the Affinity between characters and managing your party and their equipment. I used the Wii-more and the nunchuk for the controls with the nunchuk primarily used for movement and camera changes while the Wii-mote was used for accessing the menu and selecting an action. Combined, the controls and the menu items made for an accessible experience that didn’t feel clumsy.\nOne of the things I noticed about Xenoblade Chronicles as a whole is that it manages to flow quite nicely. Loading and saving times are fairly quick. The battles are fluid as there is no loading time to transition into a “Battle Stage” seen in other RPGs that typically involve a drawn out process of formally fighting the enemy with different camera angles and the obligatory victory poses. Instead, the action transitions seamlessly between exploring and fighting using the same third person view. That being said, the camera views do need some work during battles where you are fighting in tight areas as there are times you cannot see anything but a close up view of the enemy.\nTied to the seamless way between battling and exploring is the pace of the game. I’ve mentioned how quickly it can be transitioning from exploring to battling but even the cut scenes and conversations with the NPCs do not slow down or wait until you have pressed a button. You can skip conversations but there is no way to pause them or slow them down unless you press the home button. I found this forced me to pay attention to the story more since it was setting the pace. Even completing the side quests are speedy affairs in that you don’t often have to return to the person you agreed to complete a quest for and instead the game automatically updates you when you’ve reached your goal, such as destroying a certain number of Mechon. This was very handy as it is sometimes a chore to go all the way back to an area just to let a character know you have finished their quest for them.\nVisually, the game looks great considering the Wii’s graphic limitations. At first I was a little disappointed with the initial cut scenes as the characters were a little jagged around the edges but this was probably due to the amount of action happening at that time. Walking around and exploring the environments in actual gameplay could also look a little smoother but it seems to get better over time. You’ll notice that during cut scenes and when there isn’t a lot of stuff going on (such as a massive Mechon attack), the characters are not particularly detailed in terms of skin texture or hair but the expressions on their faces convey emotions very well. Otherwise the graphics during standard gameplay are satisfying to look at and really stand out during battle as your sword flashes when it hits your target or the moving electric blue light that connects between you and your party when you’re ready for a chain attack. The in-battle visuals are definitely the highlights of the game.\nThe voice acting in English was a little off putting in that the characters sounded too aristocratic so I switched it to Japanese. Even though my Japanese is at a conversational level, it sounded far more authentic for the characters to speak this way and really made the game seem like an anime during the game’s cut scenes. Whatever I did not understand in Japanese, I was able to read with the English subtitles which helped me figure out what was going on in the story. The music is also done very well. It sounds exotic and becomes more dramatic during battle.\nOverall, Xenoblade Chronicles is one of those fantastic RPG’s without a lot of filler. It is a smooth yet fast paced game that manages to offer up enough complexity to satisfy hardcore gamers but is also accessible enough for those new to the RPG world. The story is engaging and the amount of exploration in the game is impressive. While the games visuals are nothing to write home about, Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii stands as one of the best RPG experiences on the Wii to date.", "id": "<urn:uuid:d8981cf1-e60e-441e-820d-9de910934ce1>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://canadianonlinegamers.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-wii-review/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:49:30Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9714639186859131, "token_count": 2522, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The Columbus Blue Jackets are finding some comfort at home.\nMatt Calvert scored on an outstanding individual effort with 57 seconds remaining in overtime to give Columbus a 2-1 win over the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday night at Nationwide Arena.\nCalvert took the puck in his own zone, performed a 360-spin in the neutral zone to avoid Henrik Sedin, then battled through Alex Edler on a chip-in before skating between the circles and lifting a wrist shot over Cory Schneider's glove for the game-winner.\n\"It was kind of a broken play off the start,\" Calvert said. \"I got the puck by the D-man and then I saw some open ice in the middle, so I went there and saw an opening high glove side. I raised the puck and luckily it went in.\"\nColumbus has won three in a row at home after winning once while playing seven of eight on the road. The Blue Jackets are 4-0-1 in their past five home games.\nThis was the ninth straight one-goal game for the Blue Jackets and the fifth straight that went past regulation.\n\"We had some tough losses early on, some games where we felt like we were so close to getting the result we wanted,\" Calvert said. \"As hard as it is to persevere through that stretch, you always have to believe that games like this are on the other side.\n\"When you taste a close win after so many close losses, it's so much sweeter.\"\nVancouver has lost five of its past six games (1-3-2).\n\"You would like to think it's just one of those times in a season where things aren't going right for you, but I think there's still things we need to sharpen up on, clearly,\" Canucks forward Chris Higgins said. \"One goal's not going to get the win on too many nights.\"\nColumbus scored first off a very effective cycle by Nick Foligno, Ryan Johansen and R.J Umberger. Foligno went hard behind the net and his wraparound attempt came off the far, left post, where Umberger was waiting to slide it in 11:33 into the game.\n\"Our team is just being resilient,\" Johansen said. \"We just keep grinding away and it's really showed in the last four games or so where we picked up points. We just have to keep rolling now.\"\nVancouver tied it 1:05 into the third period. Canucks defenseman Jason Garrison made an aggressive pinch and wheeled the puck behind the net, winding up on Dan Hamhuis' stick at the point.

{"text": "Through the Plexi-Glass: Can You Pump Tires in a Goalie Graveyard?\nAs I was coming home from the game and gazed at my twitter feed, I saw of a lot of “Trade Luongo!” and a lot of panicking over a just under .500 record for the first few games of the regular season. Mostly, it was all about how Luongo lost the game for the Canucks and it was entirely his fault. So I’ve taken it upon myself to do some proverbial ‘pumping of tires’. Why you all ask? Simple, I have a good memory of how dreadful goaltending was in this city before the likes of Roberto Luongo.\nAs I stated in my tweet: @Aviewfromabroad “Problem isn’t #Luongo . Problem is the wanna-be fans that bought into the “2nd coming” hype that was built about him. #Takeaccountability” I never bought into the whole “LuonGod” hype.\nHe is a good goalie, but at the same time, he was still just a human who will have his bad days like you or I. Unfortunately for Luongo, he is now in a market that actually gives a hoot of how he performs on the ice instead of about 4500 fans in Miami. I also understand the whole “with the position comes the scrutiny” baggage but when the baggage is more like the cargo space of a 747, how is one supposed to ‘carry’ all that without some self-doubt? It’s close to impossible, regardless of talent level. I’m not trying to psycho-babble you all the death, I’m just saying that perhaps instead of jumping on Lu’s case constantly, take a step back and let him breathe.\nFor me, I want to give Luongo some time to prove himself. It is a new season after all. Although for some, this just a continuation of all the bad games Luongo has played as a Canuck. I want him to build up some confidence that has seemingly been lost and play like a machine more often than not. So far in this very young season, he’s not been great. To help him out as a fan, I thought it would be a good idea for me to “pump his tires” because despite all the hype and the bashing, I would rather have Roberto Luongo (as is) than Dan Cloutier, Corey Hirsch, Alfie Michaud, Troy Gamble, Petr Skudra, Bob Essensa, Kevin Weekes, Felix Potvin etc. etc. etc. Why, do some of you ask? I’ve seen awful, and it has been far worse than Roberto Luongo.\nFor those of you that don’t recognize some of those names, it’s because they didn’t last very long in this market. Let’s take Petr Skudra for example. He was one of Dan Cloutier’s backups. Did you know an angry fan actually used his name as an auction item on eBay? The description was to the effect of a Canucks’ back up goaltender, with a big five hole and no glove. The starting bid was $1 CAD. I’m not sure if anyone ever even made a bid, but it was at the time, quite amusing. Oddly enough, I am waiting for some know-it-all ‘fan’ to put Luongo up for auction on eBay with the description of “Vezina nominated, gold medal winning goalie that can’t please a fan base no matter what he does”. I’d at least start the bidding at $5…out of ‘respect’ of course.\nIt’s good to know that I am not the only one out there that feels Luongo is getting too much heat. However, I believe he can and should be better, but I’m not going to go off demanding Mike Gillis and his management and coaching staff try to trade him immediately. The thing is, I have this belief (and statistical history to back it up) that Luongo will pull it together sooner than later. Here are some from the twitterverse that feel the same way after the 4-0 loss to the New York Rangers on Tuesday Night:\n- @lyteforce: If Luongo were to reverse global warming, people would blame him for it being too cold. #Canucks #lousfault\n- @patersonjeff: Can dump on #Canucks goaltending, but how about forwards who have 1 even strength goal in last 10 periods. That don’t cut it\n- @j_carpenter_What difference does it make? if Luongo lets in 1 goal or 4..If the #Canucks dont score any they’re not gonna win..They will pull it together\n- @bobcam27-Luongo sure was terrible on the power play tonight. I don’t remember him getting a single shot on goal. #Canucks\nWe’re all good at playing ‘arm-chair’ GM from time to time, and I certainly will be the first to admit I do it as well, but how many times do so many of us have to put out virtual trades with the involvement of Roberto Luongo in them? How about we trade those guys that aren’t scoring? How about we trade the whole blue line? I guess because it’s easier to blame the goaltender, and particularly, Roberto Luongo. I’m asking you for a 20 game grace period to stop. Please. For the next few games that Luongo plays, instead of going “Trade Luongo!”, perhaps a little encouragement might help. The power of positivity is a pretty cool thing, even though I’m not a big time New Age follower, there is truth in it.\nI don’t mind ‘pumping Roberto’s tires’ more often than not, a pumped tire usually gets you further ahead. Not to mention, it sucks to run on a flat. Besides, if you leave it deflated too long, it might just damage the rim and you’ll have to replace the whole wheel.\nThat’s how I see things…through the plexi-glass.", "id": "<urn:uuid:67e7b62b-1c56-42ab-8789-af227890281d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://canuckscorner.com/2011/10/19/through-the-plexi-glass-can-you-pump-tires-in-a-goalie-graveyard/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:49:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9663819670677185, "token_count": 1344, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Is It Time For Goldman Sachs to Blow Up America?\nMost people think the Chinese are the largest holders of American Debt. Those that do are mistaken...it is the Wall Street Banks and Primary Dealers who hold most of Americas debt.\nUnfortunately for these bankers, America can no longer service its debt without borrowing more from the Primary Dealers and Wall Street bankers. America simply has borrowed too much and owes its citizens way too much in entitlement obligations to ever meet its spend requirments going forward.\nIn exchage for keeping the system going to this point, Henry Paulson extorted Congress and the American Taxpayer out of $9 Trillion dollars. The problem is more and more taxpayers are catching on to the maliciousness of this action are are beginning to make some waves.\nGoldman knows that once the American public eventually learns about the criminal behavior behind Credit Default Swaps, the citizens are going to go nuts once they learn that just about everything they own is practially worthless.\nUnlike Bernie Madoff, Goldman has some very high level poltical relationships that can be convinced to do just about anything asked.....like handing over $9 Trillion without too much effort. The real issue comes when the American people learn that most of their net worth has been pick pocketed....we are already seeing some passion with health care reform....imagine the anger with total net worth.\nFrom the bankers perspective, America as structured with its current population is a money losing proposition due to the excessive defaulting debt outstanding and the massive entitlements we are owed by our government.\nIf Goldman simply exterminated most of the population, none of the entitlement would need to be paid and as the primary debt holders, the Wall Street banks would be the title holder to most of Americas natural resouces and farmland which could be harvested and sold around the world for an incredible profit.\nYou think this concept is far fetched?

{"text": "The Four Horsemen of the Economic slowdown\nThere has been much debate here at CAPS regarding inflation/deflation. I would like to muddy the waters with a few random thoughts.\nAnyone who has been to the supermarket or a gas station in recent months is painfully aware of PRICE INFLATION. A gallon of milk or a pound of ground beef as well as most of the items on your shopping list seem to be slowly creeping up in cost each week. With increasing costs of raw materials/ingredients, manufacturers have a difficult choice: raise prices or reduce the size/weight/quantity of their retail products. I have been somewhat suprised at the frequency this year when companies have actually done BOTH. (Half-gallon containers of ice cream are rapidly being replaced by 1.75 quart packages by most producers in my local grocery.) Companies across the board have struggled in recent years to absorb raw material and energy costs, and are now forced to reduce quantity to maintain a price point or pass along these costs to the consumer. I am aware that reduced demand naturally forces prices to decrease, but given the choice to freeze/drop prices or simply close up shop, the latter increasingly makes more \"business\" sense.\nThe much heralded minimum-wage increase was widely debated this year and was probably long overdue. It is, however, the latest impotent attempt in the past several decades to deal with the reality of STAGNANT WAGES. Increases in mechanization, productivity, and globalization of labor have all contributed to the effective loss of purchasing power by the working middle class. One- income families become two-income families as a couples feel the need to enter the workforce to maintain their desired standard of living. There is continual discussion with regard to America's ever increasing perceived need for more stuff (necessities vs. luxuries, keeping up with the \"Jonses\" etc. ). Yet it is crystal clear that more and more households, whether single- or dual-income are struggling to remain solvent let alone get/stay current on their bills.\nAs the Motley Fool is a financial website, we are all well aware of the price fluctuations of equities. The past decade has been difficult for conservative, \"small-time\" investors to say the least. Well-worn phrases from the ghosts of the past such as \"buy and hold\" seem less relevant than ever in the computerized, dirivitized (if there is such a word) twenty-first century. We all hope to \"invest\" in assets that will appreciate in value over time, whether stocks, bonds, real-estate, or personal businesses. Of late, global markets and economies have confounded the brightest minds on Main Street and Wall Street. Economic cycles and rotation of classes within markets are to be expected and profited from by the informed investor. With the painful memories of several \"bursting bubbles\" fresh in our memories, namely dot,com and housing, the harsh reality of ASSET DEFLATION has become the latest lesson learned by comparatively young investors. \"Things\" do NOT always go up in value. A generation of Americans has been conditioned to expect unlimited easy credit as well as ever appreciating values of homes, real-estate and equities. Unfortunately that which goes up may/can go down. Many of the items we pay the most for in life and hope to \"own\" the longest (houses, autos, pensions, etc.) are for the first time for many people worth less, much less, than they were a month or year ago. The term 'upside down\" applies to more and more home, property, and auto owners every day.\nFinally to the crisis-de-jour: CREDIT CONTRACTION/DESTRUCTION. The CAPS community has done an excellent job educating its readers as to the house of cards known as fractional banking. The U.S. economy has roared along on the premise of everyone borrowing money for any and everything. Constant unsolicited offers for credit cards, banks loaning money to the homeless (figuratively? literally?), people using home equity as an ATM, putting daily necessities on revolving credit- all this fiscal insanity is now coming home to roost. Now that the truth is slowly trickling out about the severity of the situation, from the Federal government to huge corperations to State and local governments to your neighbor next door, things are going to change. Banks, which make money by lending the same dollar out to five or ten people have suddenly decided to get picky about the customers to which they loan. Verifyable income, tangible collateral, and excellent credit scores seem to be irrelevent today. It seems their questionable buisness practices of the past several years (decades?) have come back to bite them big time. So now in the fantasy world of the Federal Reserve they just fire up the printing presses one more time. The federal gov't borrows another trillion to use for corperate welfare, mega-bank buyouts, and token \"stimulus\" packages to keep the masses momentarily pacified. The founding fathers are likely spinning in their graves.\nThis could very well be the perfect financial storm of our lifetimes. The global powers that be may once more manipulate, fabricate, spin and deceive their way out of a U.S. recession or depression yet. Be careful where and how you place your bets.\nThanks for letting a novice vent, I admire the knowledge, generosity, and passion of the CAPS community.

{"text": "when i was very young my papa had a small cheap keyboard. i have no idea why my papa needed a keyboard. although he never listened to music, that i remember, he was somewhat musically inclined. he played the accordian and \"roll out the barrel\" to one of the beats on the keyboard, among other little ditty's. i loved the keyboard. i played jingles i heard on commercials and \"roll out the barrel\" constantly. i played old television show intros. i listened to the little songs programmed into the keyboard and i learned them. i remember my nana coming into the spare bedroom where the keyboard was at and telling me to turn it off. she meant to make it stop playing the song programmed into it. then she saw that it wasn't the keyboard playing, but me. lo and behold, i could play by ear, and surprisingly well for such a tot.\nbam. i was in piano lessons. for my first lesson my wonderful teacher----a highly eclectic woman---asked me what i knew. what a weird question. i'm here to learn piano because i don't know how to play piano, i thought. i told her i didn't know anything, really. i played for her \"chopsticks,\" \"roll out the barrel,\" \"green acres,\" and both parts of \"heart and soul\" at the same time. she was impressed and said we'd do fine.\nthen we played scales and chords forever and ever. i thought i'd never learn to read a real song. scales and chords with pennies on the backs of my hands to keep them in the proper position, finding notes with a book over my hands so i couldn't see the keyboard, and more scales and chords. forever. then one day she played a song from a sheet of music for me. and then i played it. i READ the music and i PLAYED it! i think it was called \"falling leaf\" or something like that. i still really like that little song.\ni became very good, and more than that, i really enjoyed playing the piano. it was the light of my small life.\nthen my teacher had to move. all the other piano teachers in town were booked, not to mention we couldn't really afford them anyway.\nthen the annual fourth grade choir concert came along, of which i was in. while waiting on a ride home from school i was hanging out in the choir room. my choir teacher was in her office. i sat at the piano and played the time away. i played all the songs we were singing for the concert plus a song i had written in the key of e minor. (once i learned that e minor chord i really took off, hee hee.) my teacher came out and asked me how i knew the songs. i told her, \"because i heard them.\" she asked me where i learned the last song and i told her, \"i wrote it.\" she tested me a bit and thought a bit and then sat down on the bench with me and said, very sweetly, \"how would you like to be the accompaniest for the concert?\" i was so proud. yes. of course i would!\nso, i played the whole concert entitled \"i love music.\" at the end of the concert my teacher went to the mike and told the audience the story of why i got to be the accompaniest and then she asked me totally out of the blue, would i play the song i wrote. i was quite unprepared, but went and played it. i even added to it, as even then i could never do the same thing twice in a row. i ended oddly, hah, but i got my first standing ovation.\nthe piano teachers came out of the woodwork then and i got the best one in town, i think.\nshe was amazing. she let me get away with things she wouldn't let any other student get away with. we were supposed to have a practice chart and have it signed by our parents. nope. never did that. i tried, but not very hard. she wanted me to play certain pieces, especially ones that capitalized on the speed with which i could play (truly, i think,it's because i've no sense of timing, haha, so i just play fast. but i am capable of playing really fast. so fun.). i wanted to play bizzarre anti melody avant garde pieces. she wanted me to learn hymns. i HATED playing hymns. she wasn't quite sure what to do with me, i don't think. i was a bit rebellious. plus, i think we were always behind on our payments. my dad says we still owe her a payment, poor thing. but, she told me that i had something in me that couldn't be taught, that i could feel the music, and that it was good, so she stayed my teacher nonetheless and she taught me quite a lot.\ni got to do a lot of things with piano. i was guest pianist at various churches. i was even a guest player at a very talented person's senior recital, for which i was shocked and honored. i went to a few competitions. i don't think i ever won. some of them were just playing for people who sort of graded you. i also got to record it and a musician friend of mine in denton used it on his album, \"c'est cheese.\"\ni remember dad and i going to wal-mart late one night to pick out an outfit for a competition. i don't know why i remember this outfit. we had a hard time finding anything and ended with a blue pleated skirt that i had to roll up at the waist, a big white low v-neck sweater with a blue turtle neck underneath and some borrowed, too-big black pointed toe flats. i had the 80's hair and funky glasses to boot. it was not a pretty picture. i just remember hiking that rolled waist up over and over again. when it was my turn to play i went in and nailed it. my dad was standing outside of the door listening and when i came out he had this little gathering around him that, of course, all knew i was his daughter. they were applauding and i got that one armed wrap around hug that squishes your shoulder into your ear.\nand then, sometime around 9th grade, i think, my teacher moved. i never got another teacher after that. i don't think i ever reached my full piano potential.\ni kept singing and played trumpet and frenchorn and learned a good bit of the other instruments. (excluding reed instruments. blah. i can't even make a clarinet honk.) early college i got a guitar and can mostly satisfy myself there. i sound better than i am and i have to fake an f chord.\ni haven't really played the piano since the middle of highschool.\nbenji got a keyboard last week to use with his sound design. i still have no idea what the hell he's going to do with it, but haven't quite expressed it. my only concern was because it was expensive, but it's his money so i won't question and look forward to seeing what he comes up with.\nagain, benji got a keyboard last week, and i dug out some old music. there are things i played in 6th grade that i cannot touch now. i don't know whether i should feel good, because i used to be good, or awful, because i'm so bad now. i've been brushing up. so far i've attempted \"invention no. 13\" by bach, \"rondo alla turca\" by mozart, a few prelude's by chopin, \"fur elise,\" of course, by beethoven, and an old favorite, \"solfeggietto,\" by bach. i can get through them, but they are struggles now. going through with the right hand, then the left, then measure by measure then just announcing, \"fuck it!\" and playing my little heart out, mistakes and all.\ni cannot explain to you how good it feels. i'm quite determined to get as much as i can back, and to contenuie to play as often as i can.\nyesterday, i played with penn on my lap. i played him right to sleep. i do not know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but i'm quite sure i'll try it again to see if it works.\n\"for sale\" 15 months 34 38 advice animals anniversary art art conspiracy art danielmiller carissa article audio Austin Avalon babies baby band of puppets baseball basketball bat bike bingo birthday bowling bread breast buffalo Candy capitol carissa Cedric change charity cheetahs christmas city cleaning clouds coffee community connor cookies Costumes crawling cubscouts cupcake cupcakes cycling dallas dance daniel miller danielmiller death decor design doctor dogs duh eco eight months eleven months encouragement endorsement entertainment Ethan events family family portrait feedback fiction first communion flowers food food garden fourteen months friends fun funny garden geek goal gratitude green grief haile wossen hair Hal Samples halloween happy harry moss park heart help holiday house humor inspiration instagram internet iphone johnny citizen kids klyde warren park knitting learn life literature loss love Lucy maple manor hotel margot margot love margot sad mastitis maternity me meme memory mess mom money mosquito mothers day motivation mourning move museum music nana nap neighborhood nine months noise nostalgia oklahoma old red courthouse omg one opinion optimism overseas overwhelmed papa parenting party penn penn summer penn video people photo photo baby photography pinewood derby play playground politics poll portland portrait potatoes pregnant present presents press print procrastinate published pumpkin pie question quote roadtrip sad scary school science fair scones senior seven months Shadow sick sigh six months skateboard skatepark skating soccer soup spring break spring carnival stephan pyles strawberry studio suck sugarfilled summer swiss chard talent show tea technology ten months texas texas state fair thanksgiving the lab third grade thirteen months thriller tip toys travel travel baby tree turkey twelve months twitter unhappy vacation valentines day video wagon want weather wedding weekend what? whoops wish work worry", "id": "<urn:uuid:0742ba43-ee8c-471e-8428-f7abce6164ec>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://carissabyers.blogspot.com/2004/11/piano.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9825250506401062, "token_count": 2122, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Commercial Noise"]}

{"text": "Friday, March 12, 2010\nIF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THE NAMES RIGHT....\nIt's bad enough the Patriot-News hasn't bothered to send a reporter to a trial that culminates a story it broke with its own reporting.\nBut if today's \"commentary\" by Laura Vecsey is any indication, no one at that Patriot-News is bothering to read anyone else's coverage of the trial.\nFirst of all, Vecsey (and anyone proofing the copy over there), the name of Mike Veon's attorney is Joel Sansone, not Santone.\nAnd the name of the lead prosecutor is E. Marc Costanzo, not Constanza. (Perhaps Vecsey and the Patriot-News staff are spending their time watching Seinfeld reruns instead of paying attention to the trial!)\nAfter a six-week trial that raised significant questions of prosecutorial intimidation, the credibility of witnesses, the accuracy of exhibits, the thoroughness of the investigation, the motivation of both investigators and witnesses and the very foundation of Pennsylvania's legal, governmental and political institutions, Vecsey is concerned with just one point: Why were the the closing arguments so loooooooooong?\nWe're sorry you were bored, Laura. Those who've actually followed the trial, both in the courtroom and on Twitter, know that attorneys for each of the four defendants were limited to just two hours. Those who've covered the courts for more than part of one day know it's unusual for an attorney to be held to such a limit.

{"text": "FIRST ENGLISH EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH OF GLENDALE v. COUNTY\nOF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT\nArgued January 14, 1987\nDecided June 9, 1987\nIn 1957, appellant church purchased land on which it operated a campground, known as \"Lutherglen,\" as a retreat center and a recreational area for handicapped children. The land is located in a canyon along the banks of a creek that is the natural drainage channel for a watershed area. In 1978, a flood destroyed Lutherglen's buildings. In response to the flood, appellee Los Angeles County, in 1979, adopted an interim ordinance prohibiting the construction or reconstruction of any building or structure in an interim flood protection area that included the land on which Lutherglen had stood. Shortly after the ordinance was adopted, appellant filed suit in a California court, alleging, inter alia, that the ordinance denied appellant all use of Lutherglen, and seeking to recover damages in inverse condemnation for such loss of use. The court granted a motion to strike the allegation, basing its ruling on Agins v. Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d 266, 598 P.2d 25, aff'd on other grounds, 447 U.S. 255 , in which the California Supreme Court held that a landowner may not maintain an inverse condemnation suit based upon a \"regulatory\" taking, and that compensation is not required until the challenged regulation or ordinance has been held excessive in an action for declaratory relief or a writ of mandamus and the government has nevertheless decided to continue the regulation in effect. Because appellant alleged a regulatory taking and sought only damages, the trial court deemed the allegation that the ordinance denied all use of Lutherglen to be irrelevant.

Bosselman and Elizabeth S. Merritt.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\nIn this case the California Court of Appeal held that a landowner who claims that his property has been \"taken\" by a land-use regulation may not recover damages for the time before [482 U.S. 304, 307] it is finally determined that the regulation constitutes a \"taking\" of his property. We disagree, and conclude that in these circumstances the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution would require compensation for that period.\nIn 1957, appellant First English Evangelical Lutheran Church purchased a 21-acre parcel of land in a canyon along the banks of the Middle Fork of Mill Creek in the Angeles National Forest. The Middle Fork is the natural drainage channel for a watershed area owned by the National Forest Service. Twelve of the acres owned by the church are flat land, and contained a dining hall, two bunkhouses, a caretaker's lodge, an outdoor chapel, and a footbridge across the creek. The church operated on the site a campground, known as \"Lutherglen,\" as a retreat center and a recreational area for handicapped children.\nIn July 1977, a forest fire denuded the hills upstream from Lutherglen, destroying approximately 3,860 acres of the watershed area and creating a serious flood hazard. Such flooding occurred on February 9 and 10, 1978, when a storm dropped 11 inches of rain in the watershed. The runoff from the storm overflowed the banks of the Mill Creek, flooding Lutherglen and destroying its buildings.\nIn response to the flooding of the canyon, appellee County of Los Angeles adopted Interim Ordinance No. 11,855 in January 1979. The ordinance provided that \"[a] person shall not construct, reconstruct, place or enlarge any building or structure, any portion of which is, or will be, located within the outer boundary lines of the interim flood protection area located in Mill Creek Canyon . . . .\" App. to Juris. Statement A31. The ordinance was effective immediately because the county determined that it was \"required for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety . . . .\" Id., at A32. The interim flood protection area described by the ordinance included the flat areas on either side of Mill Creek on which Lutherglen had stood. [482 U.S. 304, 308]\nThe church filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California a little more than a month after the ordinance was adopted. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged two claims against the county and the Los Angeles County Flood Control District. The first alleged that the defendants were liable under Cal. Govt. Code Ann. 835 (West 1980) 1 for dangerous conditions on their upstream properties that contributed to the flooding of Lutherglen. As a part of this claim, appellant also alleged that \"Ordinance No. 11,855 denies [appellant] all use of Lutherglen.\" App. 12, 49. The second claim sought to recover from the Flood Control District in inverse condemnation and in tort for engaging in cloud seeding during the storm that flooded Lutherglen. Appellant sought damages under each count for loss of use of Lutherglen. The defendants moved to strike the portions of the complaint alleging that the county's ordinance denied all use of Lutherglen, on the view that the California Supreme Court's decision in Agins v. Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d 266, 598 P.2d 25 (1979), aff'd on other grounds, 447 U.S. 255 (1980), rendered the allegation \"entirely immaterial and irrelevant[, with] no bearing upon any conceivable cause of action herein.\" App. 22. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. 436(a) (West Supp. 1987) (\"The court may . . .[s]trike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading\").\nIn Agins v. Tiburon, supra, the California Supreme Court decided that a landowner may not maintain an inverse condemnation suit in the courts of that State based upon a \"regulatory\" taking. 24 Cal. 3d, at 275-277, 598 P.2d, at 29-31. In the court's view, maintenance of such a suit would allow a landowner to force the legislature to exercise its power of eminent domain. Under this decision, then, compensation is not required until the challenged regulation or ordinance has been held excessive in an action for declaratory [482 U.S. 304, 309] relief or a writ of mandamus and the government has nevertheless decided to continue the regulation in effect. Based on this decision, the trial court in the present case granted the motion to strike the allegation that the church had been denied all use of Lutherglen. It explained that \"a careful rereading of the Agins case persuades the Court that when an ordinance, even a non-zoning ordinance, deprives a person of the total use of his lands, his challenge to the ordinance is by way of declaratory relief or possibly mandamus.\" App. 26. Because the appellant alleged a regulatory taking and sought only damages, the allegation that the ordinance denied all use of Lutherglen was deemed irrelevant. 2\nOn appeal, the California Court of Appeal read the complaint as one seeking \"damages for the uncompensated taking of all use of Lutherglen by County Ordinance No. 11,855 . . . .\" App. to Juris. Statement A13-A14. It too relied on the California Supreme Court's decision in Agins in rejecting the cause of action, declining appellant's invitation to reevaluate Agins in light of this Court's opinions in San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U.S. 621 (1981). The court found itself obligated to follow Agins \"because the United States Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the question of whether a state may constitutionally limit the remedy for a taking to nonmonetary relief . . . .\" App. to Juris. Statement A16. It accordingly affirmed the trial court's decision to strike the allegations concerning appellee's ordinance. 3 The California Supreme Court denied review. [482 U.S. 304, 310]\nThis appeal followed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 478 U.S. 1003 (1986). Appellant asks us to hold that the California Supreme Court erred in Agins v. Tiburon in determining that the Fifth Amendment, as made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, does not require compensation as a remedy for \"temporary\" regulatory takings - those regulatory takings which are ultimately invalidated by the courts. 4 Four times this decade, we have considered similar claims and have found ourselves for one reason or another unable to consider the merits of the Agins rule. See MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340 (1986); Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172 (1985); San Diego Gas & Electric Co., supra; Agins v. Tiburon, supra. For the reasons explained below, however, we find the constitutional claim properly presented in this case, and hold that [482 U.S. 304, 311] on these facts the California courts have decided the compensation question inconsistently with the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.\nConcerns with finality left us unable to reach the remedial question in the earlier cases where we have been asked to consider the rule of Agins. See MacDonald, Sommer & Frates, supra, at 351 (summarizing cases). In each of these cases, we concluded either that regulations considered to be in issue by the state court did not effect a taking, Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S., at 263 , or that the factual disputes yet to be resolved by state authorities might still lead to the conclusion that no taking had occurred. MacDonald, Sommer & Frates, supra, at 351-353; Williamson County, supra, at 188-194; San Diego Gas & Electric Co., supra, at 631-632. Consideration of the remedial question in those circumstances, we concluded, would be premature.\nThe posture of the present case is quite different. Appellant's complaint alleged that \"Ordinance No. 11,855 denies [it] all use of Lutherglen,\" and sought damages for this deprivation. App. 12, 49. In affirming the decision to strike this allegation, the Court of Appeal assumed that the complaint sought \"damages for the uncompensated taking of all use of Lutherglen by County Ordinance No. 11,855.\" App. to Juris. Statement A13-A14 (emphasis added). It relied on the California Supreme Court's Agins decision for the conclusion that \"the remedy for a taking [is limited] to nonmonetary relief . . . .\" App. to Juris. Statement A16 (emphasis added). The disposition of the case on these grounds isolates the remedial question for our consideration. The rejection of appellant's allegations did not rest on the view that they were false. Cf. MacDonald, Sommer & Frates, supra, at 352-353, n. 8 (California court rejected allegation in the complaint that appellant was deprived of all beneficial use of its property); Agins v. Tiburon, supra, at 259, n. 6 (same). Nor did the court rely on the theory that regulatory measures such as [482 U.S. 304, 312] Ordinance No. 11,855 may never constitute a taking in the constitutional sense. Instead, the claims were deemed irrelevant solely because of the California Supreme Court's decision in Agins that damages are unavailable to redress a \"temporary\" regulatory taking. 5 The California Court of Appeal has thus held that, regardless of the correctness of appellant's claim that the challenged ordinance denies it \"all use of Lutherglen,\" appellant may not recover damages until the ordinance is finally declared unconstitutional, and then only for any period after that declaration for which the county seeks to enforce it. The constitutional question pretermitted in our earlier cases is therefore squarely presented here. 6\nWe reject appellee's suggestion that, regardless of the state court's treatment of the question, we must independently evaluate the adequacy of the complaint and resolve the [482 U.S. 304, 313] takings claim on the merits before we can reach the remedial question. However \"cryptic\" - to use appellee's description - the allegations with respect to the taking were, the California courts deemed them sufficient to present the issue. We accordingly have no occasion to decide whether the ordinance at issue actually denied appellant all use of its property 7 or whether the county might avoid the conclusion that a compensable taking had occurred by establishing that the denial of all use was insulated as a part of the State's authority to enact safety regulations. See, e. g., Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915); Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887). These questions, of course, remain open for decision on the remand we direct today. We now turn to the question whether the Just Compensation Clause requires the government to pay for \"temporary\" regulatory takings. 8 [482 U.S. 304, 314]\nConsideration of the compensation question must begin with direct reference to the language of the Fifth Amendment, which provides in relevant part that \"private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" As its language indicates, and as the Court has frequently noted, this provision does not prohibit the taking of private property, but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power. See Williamson County, 473 U.S., at 194 ; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 297 , n. 40 (1981); Hurley v. [482 U.S. 304, 315] Kincaid, 285 U.S. 95, 104 (1932); Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U.S. 312, 336 (1893); United States v. Jones, 109 U.S. 513, 518 (1883). This basic understanding of the Amendment makes clear that it is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se, but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking. Thus, government action that works a taking of property rights necessarily implicates the \"constitutional obligation to pay just compensation.\" Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960).\nWe have recognized that a landowner is entitled to bring an action in inverse condemnation as a result of \"`the self-executing character of the constitutional provision with respect to compensation . . . .'\" United States v. Clarke, 445 U.S. 253, 257 (1980), quoting 6 P. Nichols, Eminent Domain 25.41 (3d rev. ed. 1972). As noted in JUSTICE BRENNAN's dissent in San Diego Gas & Electric Co., 450 U.S., at 654 -655, it has been established at least since Jacobs v. United States, 290 U.S. 13 (1933), that claims for just compensation are grounded in the Constitution itself:\nIt has also been established doctrine at least since Justice Holmes' opinion for the Court in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), that \"[t]he general rule at least is, that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\" Id., at 415. While the typical taking occurs when the government acts to condemn property in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, the entire doctrine of inverse condemnation is predicated on the proposition that a taking may occur without such formal proceedings. In Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177-178 (1872), construing a provision in the Wisconsin Constitution identical to the Just Compensation Clause, this Court said:\nWhile the California Supreme Court may not have actually disavowed this general rule in Agins, we believe that it has truncated the rule by disallowing damages that occurred prior to the ultimate invalidation of the challenged regulation. The California Supreme Court justified its conclusion at length in the Agins opinion, concluding that:\nIn considering this question, we find substantial guidance in cases where the government has only temporarily exercised its right to use private property. In United States v. Dow, supra, at 26, though rejecting a claim that the Government may not abandon condemnation proceedings, the Court observed that abandonment \"results in an alteration in the property interest taken - from [one of] full ownership to one of temporary use and occupation. . . . In such cases compensation would be measured by the principles normally governing the taking of a right to use property temporarily. See Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1 1949.; United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372 1946.; United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373 1945..\" Each of the cases cited by the Dow Court involved appropriation of private property by the United States for use during World War II. Though the takings were in fact \"temporary,\" see United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372, 375 (1946), there was no question that compensation would be required for the Government's interference with the use of the property; the Court was concerned in each case with determining the proper measure of the monetary relief to which the property holders were entitled. See Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 4 -21 (1949); Petty Motor Co., supra, at 377-381; United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 379 -384 (1945).\nThese cases reflect the fact that \"temporary\" takings which, as here, deny a landowner all use of his property, are not different in kind from permanent takings, for which the Constitution clearly requires compensation. Cf. San Diego Gas & Electric Co., 450 U.S., at 657 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (\"Nothing in the Just Compensation Clause suggests that `takings' must be permanent and irrevocable\"). It is axiomatic that the Fifth Amendment's just compensation provision is \"designed to bar Government from forcing some [482 U.S. 304, 319] people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\" Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S., at 49 . See also Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 123 -125 (1978); Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U.S., at 325 . In the present case the interim ordinance was adopted by the County of Los Angeles in January 1979, and became effective immediately. Appellant filed suit within a month after the effective date of the ordinance and yet when the California Supreme Court denied a hearing in the case on October 17, 1985, the merits of appellant's claim had yet to be determined. The United States has been required to pay compensation for leasehold interests of shorter duration than this. The value of a leasehold interest in property for a period of years may be substantial, and the burden on the property owner in extinguishing such an interest for a period of years may be great indeed. See, e. g., United States v. General Motors, supra. Where this burden results from governmental action that amounted to a taking, the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that the government pay the landowner for the value of the use of the land during this period. Cf. United States v. Causby, 328 U.S., at 261 (\"It is the owner's loss, not the taker's gain, which is the measure of the value of the property taken\"). Invalidation of the ordinance or its successor ordinance after this period of time, though converting the taking into a \"temporary\" one, is not a sufficient remedy to meet the demands of the Just Compensation Clause.\nAppellee argues that requiring compensation for denial of all use of land prior to invalidation is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in Danforth v. United States, 308 U.S. 271 (1939), and Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980). In Danforth, the landowner contended that the \"taking\" of his property had occurred prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings, by reason of the enactment of the Flood Control Act itself. He claimed that the passage of that Act had diminished [482 U.S. 304, 320] the value of his property because the plan embodied in the Act required condemnation of a flowage easement across his property. The Court held that in the context of condemnation proceedings a taking does not occur until compensation is determined and paid, and went on to say that \"[a] reduction or increase in the value of property may occur by reason of legislation for or the beginning or completion of a project,\" but \"[s]uch changes in value are incidents of ownership. They cannot be considered as a `taking' in the constitutional sense.\" Danforth, supra, at 285. Agins likewise rejected a claim that the city's preliminary activities constituted a taking, saying that \"[m]ere fluctuations in value during the process of governmental decisionmaking, absent extraordinary delay, are `incidents of ownership.'\" See 447 U.S., at 263 , n. 9.\nBut these cases merely stand for the unexceptional proposition that the valuation of property which has been taken must be calculated as of the time of the taking, and that depreciation in value of the property by reason of preliminary activity is not chargeable to the government. Thus, in Agins, we concluded that the preliminary activity did not work a taking. It would require a considerable extension of these decisions to say that no compensable regulatory taking may occur until a challenged ordinance has ultimately been held invalid. 10 [482 U.S. 304, 321]\nNothing we say today is intended to abrogate the principle that the decision to exercise the power of eminent domain is a legislative function \"`for Congress and Congress alone to determine.'\" Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 240 (1984), quoting Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 33 (1954). Once a court determines that a taking has occurred, the government retains the whole range of options already available - amendment of the regulation, withdrawal of the invalidated regulation, or exercise of eminent domain. Thus we do not, as the Solicitor General suggests, \"permit a court, at the behest of a private person, to require the . . . Government to exercise the power of eminent domain . . . .\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22. We merely hold that where the government's activities have already worked a taking of all use of property, no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the period during which the taking was effective.\nWe also point out that the allegation of the complaint which we treat as true for purposes of our decision was that the ordinance in question denied appellant all use of its property. We limit our holding to the facts presented, and of course do not deal with the quite different questions that would arise in the case of normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like which are not before us. We realize that even our present holding will undoubtedly lessen to some extent the freedom and flexibility of land-use planners and governing bodies of municipal corporations when enacting land-use regulations. But such consequences necessarily flow from any decision upholding a claim of constitutional right; many of the provisions of the Constitution are designed to limit the flexibility and freedom of governmental authorities, and the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment is one of them. As Justice Holmes aptly noted more than 50 years ago, \"a strong public [482 U.S. 304, 322] desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.\" Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 416 .\nHere we must assume that the Los Angeles County ordinance has denied appellant all use of its property for a considerable period of years, and we hold that invalidation of the ordinance without payment of fair value for the use of the property during this period of time would be a constitutionally insufficient remedy. The judgment of the California Court of Appeal is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n[ Footnote 2 ] The trial court also granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings on the second cause of action, based on cloud seeding. It limited trial on the first cause of action for damages under Cal. Govt. Code Ann. 835 (West 1980), rejecting the inverse condemnation claim. At the close of plaintiff's evidence, the trial court granted a nonsuit on behalf of defendants, dismissing the entire complaint.\n[ Footnote 3 ] The California Court of Appeal also affirmed the lower court's orders limiting the issues for trial on the first cause of action, granting a nonsuit on the issues that proceeded to trial, and dismissing the second cause of action - based on cloud seeding - to the extent it was founded on a theory [482 U.S. 304, 310] of strict liability in tort. The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the second cause of action could not be maintained against the Flood Control District under the theory of inverse condemnation. The case was remanded for further proceedings on this claim.\nThese circumstances alone, apart from the more particular issues presented in takings cases and discussed in the text, require us to consider whether the pending resolution of further liability questions deprives us of jurisdiction because we are not presented with a \"final judgmen[t] or decre[e]\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 1257. We think that this case is fairly characterized as one \"in which the federal issue, finally decided by the highest court in the State [in which a decision could be had], will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings.\" Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 480 (1975). As we explain infra, at 311-313, the California Court of Appeal rejected appellant's federal claim that it was entitled to just compensation from the county for the taking of its property; this distinct issue of federal law will survive and require decision no matter how further proceedings resolve the issues concerning the liability of the Flood Control District for its cloud seeding operation.\n[ Footnote 4 ] The Fifth Amendment provides \"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation,\" and applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226 (1897).\n[ Footnote 5 ] It has been urged that the California Supreme Court's discussion of the compensation question in Agins v. Tiburon was dictum, because the court had already decided that the regulations could not work a taking. See Martino v. Santa Clara Valley Water District, 703 F.2d 1141, 1147 (CA9 1983) (\"extended dictum\"). The Court of Appeal in this case considered and rejected the possibility that the compensation discussion in Agins was dictum. See App. to Juris. Statement A14-A15, quoting Aptos Seascape Corp. v. County of Santa Cruz, 138 Cal. App. 3d 484, 493, 188 Cal. Rptr. 191, 195 (1982) (\"[I]t is apparent that the Supreme Court itself did not intend its discussion [of inverse condemnation as a remedy for a taking] to be considered dictum . . . and it has not been treated as such in subsequent Court of Appeal cases\"). Whether treating the claim as a takings claim is inconsistent with the first holding of Agins is not a matter for our concern. It is enough that the court did so for us to reach the remedial question.\n[ Footnote 6 ] Our cases have also required that one seeking compensation must \"seek compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so\" before the claim is ripe for review. Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172, 194 (1985). It is clear that appellant met this requirement. Having assumed that a taking occurred, the California court's dismissal of the action establishes that \"the inverse condemnation procedure is unavailable . . . .\" Id., at 197. The compensation claim is accordingly ripe for our consideration.\n[ Footnote 7 ] Because the issue was not raised in the complaint or considered relevant by the California courts in their assumption that a taking had occurred, we also do not consider the effect of the county's permanent ordinance on the conclusions of the courts below. That ordinance, adopted in 1981 and reproduced at App. to Juris. Statement A32-A33, provides that \"[a] person shall not use, erect, construct, move onto, or . . . alter, modify, enlarge or reconstruct any building or structure within the boundaries of a flood protection district except . . . [a]ccessory buildings and structures that will not substantially impede the flow of water, including sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, approved by the county engineer . . .; [a]utomobile parking facilities incidental to a lawfully established use; [and] [f]lood-control structures approved by the chief engineer of the Los Angeles County Flood Control District.\" County Code 22.44.220.\n[ Footnote 8 ] In addition to challenging the finality of the takings decision below, appellee raises two other challenges to our jurisdiction. First, going to both the appellate and certiorari jurisdiction of this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1257, appellee alleges that appellant has failed to preserve for review any claim under federal law. Though the complaint in this case invoked only the California Constitution, appellant argued in the Court of Appeal that \"recent Federal decisions . . . show the Federal Constitutional error in . . . Agins[ v. Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d 266, 598 P.2d 25 (1979)].\" App. to Appellant's Opposition to Appellee's Second Motion to Dismiss A13. The Court of Appeal, by applying the state rule of Agins to dismiss [482 U.S. 304, 314] appellant's action, rejected on the merits the claim that the rule violated the United States Constitution. This disposition makes irrelevant for our purposes any deficiencies in the complaint as to federal issues. Where the state court has considered and decided the constitutional claim, we need not consider how or when the question was raised. Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v. Cohen, 234 U.S. 123, 134 (1914). Having succeeded in bringing the federal issue into the case, appellant preserved this question on appeal to the California Supreme Court, see App. to Appellant's Opposition to Appellee's Second Motion to Dismiss A14-A22, which declined to review its Agins decision. Accordingly, we find that the issue urged here was both raised and passed upon below.\nSecond, appellee challenges our appellate jurisdiction on the grounds that the case below did not draw \"in question the validity of a statute of any state . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. 1257(2). There is, of course, no doubt that the ordinance at issue in this case is \"a statute of [a] state\" for purposes of 1257. See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 207 , n. 3 (1975). As construed by the state courts, the complaint in this case alleged that the ordinance, by denying all use of the property, worked a taking without providing for just compensation. We have frequently treated such challenges to zoning ordinances as challenges to their validity under the Federal Constitution, and see no reason to revise that approach here. See, e. g., MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.S. 340 (1986); Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982); Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980); Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). By holding that the failure to provide compensation was not unconstitutional, moreover, the California courts upheld the validity of the ordinance against the particular federal constitutional question at issue here - just compensation - and the case is therefore within the terms of 1257(2).\n[ Footnote 9 ] The Solicitor General urges that the prohibitory nature of the Fifth Amendment, see supra, at 314, combined with principles of sovereign immunity, establishes that the Amendment itself is only a limitation on the power of the Government to act, not a remedial provision. The cases cited in the text, we think, refute the argument of the United States that \"the Constitution does not, of its own force, furnish a basis for a court to award money damages against the government.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14. Though arising in various factual and jurisdictional settings, these cases make clear that it is the Constitution that dictates the remedy for interference with property rights amounting to a taking. See San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U.S. 621, 655 , n. 21 (1981) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), quoting United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 748 (1947).\n[ Footnote 10 ] Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n, is not to the contrary. There, we noted that \"no constitutional violation occurs until just compensation has been denied.\" 473 U.S., at 194 , n. 13. This statement, however, was addressed to the issue whether the constitutional claim was ripe for review and did not establish that compensation is unavailable for government activity occurring before compensation is actually denied. Though, as a matter of law, an illegitimate taking might not occur until the government refuses to pay, the interference that effects a taking might begin much earlier, and compensation is measured from that time. See Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. v. United States, 467 U.S. 1, 5 (1984) (Where Government physically occupies land without condemnation proceedings, \"the owner has a right to bring an `inverse condemnation' suit to [482 U.S. 304, 321] recover the value of the land on the date of the intrusion by the Government\"). (Emphasis added.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join as to Parts I and III, dissenting.\nOne thing is certain. The Court's decision today will generate a great deal of litigation. Most of it, I believe, will be unproductive. But the mere duty to defend the actions that today's decision will spawn will undoubtedly have a significant adverse impact on the land-use regulatory process. The Court has reached out to address an issue not actually presented in this case, and has then answered that self-imposed question in a superficial and, I believe, dangerous way.\nFour flaws in the Court's analysis merit special comment. First, the Court unnecessarily and imprudently assumes that appellant's complaint alleges an unconstitutional taking of Lutherglen. Second, the Court distorts our precedents in the area of regulatory takings when it concludes that all ordinances which would constitute takings if allowed to remain in effect permanently, necessarily also constitute takings if they are in effect for only a limited period of time. Third, the Court incorrectly assumes that the California Supreme Court has already decided that it will never allow a state court to grant monetary relief for a temporary regulatory taking, and [482 U.S. 304, 323] then uses that conclusion to reverse a judgment which is correct under the Court's own theories. Finally, the Court errs in concluding that it is the Takings Clause, rather than the Due Process Clause, which is the primary constraint on the use of unfair and dilatory procedures in the land-use area.\nIn the relevant portion of its complaint for inverse condemnation, appellant alleged:\nThis Court clearly has the authority to decide this case by ruling that the complaint did not allege a taking under the Federal Constitution, 3 and therefore to avoid the novel constitutional [482 U.S. 304, 325] issue that it addresses. Even though I believe the Court's lack of self-restraint is imprudent, it is imperative to stress that the Court does not hold that appellant is entitled to compensation as a result of the flood protection regulation that the county enacted. No matter whether the regulation is treated as one that deprives appellant of its property on a permanent or temporary basis, this Court's precedents demonstrate that the type of regulatory program at issue here cannot constitute a taking.\nThus, although the Court uses the allegations of this complaint as a springboard for its discussion of a discrete legal issue, it does not, and could not under our precedents, hold that the allegations sufficiently alleged a taking or that the county's effort to preserve life and property could ever constitute a taking. As far as the United States Constitution is concerned, the claim that the ordinance was a taking of Lutherglen should be summarily rejected on its merits.\nThere is no dispute about the proposition that a regulation which goes \"too far\" must be deemed a taking. See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922). When that happens, the government has a choice: it may abandon the regulation or it may continue to regulate and compensate those whose property it takes. In the usual case, either of these options is wholly satisfactory. Paying compensation for the property is, of course, a constitutional prerogative of the sovereign. Alternatively, if the sovereign chooses not to retain the regulation, repeal will, in virtually all cases, mitigate the overall effect of the regulation so substantially that the slight diminution in value that the regulation caused while in effect cannot be classified as a taking of property. We may assume, however, that this may not always be the case. There may be some situations in which even the temporary existence of a regulation has such severe consequences that invalidation or repeal will not mitigate the damage enough to remove the \"taking\" label. This hypothetical situation is what the Court calls a \"temporary taking.\" But, contrary to the Court's implications, the fact that a regulation would constitute a taking if allowed to remain in effect permanently is by no means dispositive of the question whether the effect that the regulation has already had on the [482 U.S. 304, 329] property is so severe that a taking occurred during the period before the regulation was invalidated.\nA temporary interference with an owner's use of his property may constitute a taking for which the Constitution requires that compensation be paid. At least with respect to physical takings, the Court has so held. See ante, at 318 (citing cases). Thus, if the government appropriates a leasehold interest and uses it for a public purpose, the return of the premises at the expiration of the lease would obviously not erase the fact of the government's temporary occupation. Or if the government destroys a chicken farm by building a road through it or flying planes over it, removing the road or terminating the flights would not palliate the physical damage that had already occurred. These examples are consistent with the rule that even minimal physical occupations constitute takings which give rise to a duty to compensate. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).\nBut our cases also make it clear that regulatory takings and physical takings are very different in this, as well as other, respects. While virtually all physical invasions are deemed takings, see, e. g., Loretto, supra; United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), a regulatory program that adversely affects property values does not constitute a taking unless it destroys a major portion of the property's value. See Keystone Bituminous, 480 U.S., at 493 -502; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 296 (1981); Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260 (1980). This diminution of value inquiry is unique to regulatory takings. Unlike physical invasions, which are relatively rare and easily identifiable without making any economic analysis, regulatory programs constantly affect property values in countless ways, and only the most extreme regulations can constitute takings. Some dividing line must be established between everyday regulatory inconveniences and those so severe that they constitute takings. The diminution of value [482 U.S. 304, 330] inquiry has long been used in identifying that line. As Justice Holmes put it: \"Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.\" Pennsylvania Coal, supra, at 413. It is this basic distinction between regulatory and physical takings that the Court ignores today.\nRegulations are three dimensional; they have depth, width, and length. As for depth, regulations define the extent to which the owner may not use the property in question. With respect to width, regulations define the amount of property encompassed by the restrictions. Finally, and for purposes of this case, essentially, regulations set forth the duration of the restrictions. It is obvious that no one of these elements can be analyzed alone to evaluate the impact of a regulation, and hence to determine whether a taking has occurred. For example, in Keystone Bituminous we declined to focus in on any discrete segment of the coal in the petitioners' mines, but rather looked to the effect that the restriction had on their entire mining project. See 480 U.S., at 493 -502; see also Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 137 (1978) (looking at owner's other buildings). Similarly, in Penn Central, the Court concluded that it was error to focus on the nature of the uses which were prohibited without also examining the many profitable uses to which the property could still be put. Id., at 130-131; see also Agins, supra, at 262-263; Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 64 -67 (1979). Both of these factors are essential to a meaningful analysis of the economic effect that regulations have on the value of property and on an owner's reasonable investment-based expectations with respect to the property.\nJust as it would be senseless to ignore these first two factors in assessing the economic effect of a regulation, one cannot conduct the inquiry without considering the duration of the restriction. See generally Williams, Smith, Siemon, [482 U.S. 304, 331] Mandelker, & Babcock, The White River Junction Manifesto, 9 Vt. L. Rev. 193, 215-218 (1984). For example, while I agreed with the Chief Justice's view that the permanent restriction on building involved in Penn Central constituted a taking, I assume that no one would have suggested that a temporary freeze on building would have also constituted a taking. Similarly, I am confident that even the dissenters in Keystone Bituminous would not have concluded that the restriction on bituminous coal mining would have constituted a taking had it simply required the mining companies to delay their operations until an appropriate safety inspection could be made.\nOn the other hand, I am willing to assume that some cases may arise in which a property owner can show that prospective invalidation of the regulation cannot cure the taking - that the temporary operation of a regulation has caused such a significant diminution in the property's value that compensation must be afforded for the taking that has already occurred. For this ever to happen, the restriction on the use of the property would not only have to be a substantial one, but it would also have to remain in effect for a significant percentage of the property's useful life. In such a case an application of our test for regulatory takings would obviously require an inquiry into the duration of the restriction, as well as its scope and severity. See Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172, 190 -191 (1985) (refusing to evaluate taking claim when the longterm economic effects were uncertain because it was not clear that restrictions would remain in effect permanently).\nThe cases that the Court relies upon for the proposition that there is no distinction between temporary and permanent takings, see ante, at 318, are inapposite, for they all deal with physical takings - where the diminution of value test is inapplicable. 8 None of those cases is controversial; the state [482 U.S. 304, 332] certainly may not occupy an individual's home for a month and then escape compensation by leaving and declaring the occupation \"temporary.\" But what does that have to do with the proper inquiry for regulatory takings? Why should there be a constitutional distinction between a permanent restriction that only reduces the economic value of the property by a fraction - perhaps one-third - and a restriction that merely postpones the development of a property for a fraction of its useful life - presumably far less than a third? In the former instance, no taking has occurred; in the latter case, the Court now proclaims that compensation for a taking must be provided. The Court makes no effort to explain these irreconcilable results. Instead, without any attempt to fit its proclamation into our regulatory takings cases, the Court boldly announces that once a property owner makes out a claim that a regulation would constitute a taking if allowed to stand, then he or she is entitled to damages for the period of time between its enactment and its invalidation.\nUntil today, we have repeatedly rejected the notion that all temporary diminutions in the value of property automatically activate the compensation requirement of the Takings Clause. In Agins, we held:\nThe Court's reasoning also suffers from severe internal inconsistency. Although it purports to put to one side \"normal delays in obtaining building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances and the like,\" ante, at 321, the Court does not explain why there is a constitutional distinction between a total denial of all use of property during such \"normal delays\" and an equally total denial for the same length of time in order to determine whether a regulation has \"gone too far\" to be sustained unless the government is prepared to condemn the property. Precisely the same interference with a real estate developer's plans may be occasioned by protracted proceedings which terminate with a zoning board's decision that the public interest would be served by modification of its regulation and equally protracted litigation which ends with a judicial determination that the existing zoning restraint has \"gone too far,\" and that the board must therefore grant the developer a variance. The Court's analysis takes no cognizance of these realities. Instead, it appears to erect an artificial distinction between \"normal delays\" and the delays involved in obtaining a court declaration that the regulation constitutes a taking. 10\nIn my opinion, the question whether a \"temporary taking\" has occurred should not be answered by simply looking at the reason a temporary interference with an owner's use of his property is terminated. 11 Litigation challenging the validity of a land-use restriction gives rise to a delay that is just as \"normal\" as an administrative procedure seeking a variance [482 U.S. 304, 335] or an approval of a controversial plan. 12 Just because a plaintiff can prove that a land-use restriction would constitute a taking if allowed to remain in effect permanently does not mean that he or she can also prove that its temporary application rose to the level of a constitutional taking.\nThe Court recognizes that the California courts have the right to adopt invalidation of an excessive regulation as the appropriate remedy for the permanent effects of overburdensome regulations, rather than allowing the regulation to stand and ordering the government to afford compensation for the permanent taking. See ante, at 319; see also Yolo County, supra, at 362-363, and n. 4 (WHITE, J., dissenting); San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U.S. 621, 657 (1981) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). The difference between these two remedies is less substantial than one might assume. When a court invalidates a regulation, the Legislative or Executive Branch must then decide whether to condemn the property in order to proceed with the regulatory scheme. On the other hand, if the court requires compensation for a permanent taking, the Executive or Legislative Branch may still repeal the regulation and thus prevent the permanent taking. The difference, therefore, is only in what will happen in the case of Legislative or Executive inertia. Many scholars have debated the respective merits of the alternative approaches in light of separation-of-powers concerns, 13 but our only concern is with a state court's decision on [482 U.S. 304, 336] which procedure it considers more appropriate. California is fully competent to decide how it wishes to deal with the separation-of-powers implications of the remedy it routinely uses. 14\nOnce it is recognized that California may deal with the permanent taking problem by invalidating objectionable regulations, it becomes clear that the California Court of Appeal's decision in this case should be affirmed. Even if this Court is correct in stating that one who makes out a claim for a permanent taking is automatically entitled to some compensation for the temporary aspect of the taking as well, the States still have the right to deal with the permanent aspect of a taking by invalidating the regulation. That is all that the California courts have done in this case. They have refused to proceed upon a complaint which sought only damages, and which did not contain a request for a declaratory invalidation of the regulation, as clearly required by California precedent.\nThe Court seriously errs, therefore, when it claims that the California court held that \"a landowner who claims that his property has been `taken' by a land-use regulation may not recover damages for the time before it is finally determined that the regulation constitutes a `taking' of his property.\" Ante, at 306-307. Perhaps the Court discerns such a practice from some of the California Supreme Court's earlier decisions, but that is surely no reason for reversing a procedural judgment in a case in which the dismissal of the complaint was entirely consistent with an approach that the [482 U.S. 304, 337] Court endorses. Indeed, I am not all that sure how the California courts would deal with a landowner who seeks both invalidation of the regulation and damages for the temporary taking that occurred prior to the requested invalidation.\nAs a matter of regulating the procedure in its own state courts, the California Supreme Court has decided that mandamus or declaratory relief rather than inverse condemnation provides \"the appropriate relief\" for one who challenges a regulation as a taking. Agins v. Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d, at 277, 598 P.2d, at 31. This statement in Agins can be interpreted in two quite different ways. First, it may merely require the property owner to exhaust his equitable remedies before asserting any claim for damages. Under that reading, a postponement of any consideration of monetary relief, or even a requirement that a \"temporary regulatory taking\" claim be asserted in a separate proceeding after the temporary interference has ended, would not violate the Federal Constitution. Second, the Agins opinion may be read to indicate that California courts will never award damages for a temporary regulatory taking. 15 Even if we assume that such a rigid rule would bar recovery in the California courts in a few meritorious cases, we should not allow a litigant to challenge the rule unless his complaint contains allegations explaining why declaratory relief would not provide him with an adequate remedy, and unless his complaint at least complies with the California rule of procedure to the extent that the rule is clearly legitimate. Since the First Amendment is not implicated, the fact that California's rule may be somewhat \"overbroad\" is no reason for permitting a party to complain about the impact of the rule on other property owners [482 U.S. 304, 338] who actually file complaints that call California's rule into question.\nIn any event, the Court has no business speculating on how the California courts will deal with this problem when it is presented to them. Despite the many cases in which the California courts have applied the Agins rule, the Court can point to no case in which application of the rule has deprived a property owner of his rightful compensation.\nIn criminal litigation we have steadfastly adhered to the practice of requiring the defendant to exhaust his or her state remedies before collaterally attacking a conviction based on a claimed violation of the Federal Constitution. That requirement is supported by our respect for the sovereignty of the several States and by our interest in having federal judges decide federal constitutional issues only on the basis of fully developed records. See generally Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982). The States' interest in controlling land-use development and in exploring all the ramifications of challenge to a zoning restriction should command the same deference from the federal judiciary. See Williamson, 473 U.S., at 194 -197. And our interest in avoiding the decision of federal constitutional questions on anything less than a fully informed basis counsels against trying to decide whether equitable relief has forestalled a temporary taking until after we know what the relief is. In short, even if the California courts adhere to a rule of never granting monetary relief for a temporary regulatory taking, I believe we should require the property owner to exhaust his state remedies before confronting the question whether the net result of the state proceedings has amounted to a temporary taking of property without just compensation. In this case, the Church should be required to pursue an action demanding invalidation of the ordinance prior to seeking this Court's review of California's procedures. 16 [482 U.S. 304, 339]\nThe appellant should not be permitted to circumvent that requirement by omitting any prayer for equitable relief from its complaint. I believe the California Supreme Court is justified in insisting that the owner recover as much of its property as possible before foisting any of it on an unwilling governmental purchaser. The Court apparently agrees with this proposition. Thus, even on the Court's own radical view of temporary regulatory takings announced today, the California courts had the right to strike this complaint.\nThere is, of course, a possibility that land-use planning, like other forms of regulation, will unfairly deprive a citizen of the right to develop his property at the time and in the manner that will best serve his economic interests. The \"regulatory taking\" doctrine announced in Pennsylvania Coal places a limit on the permissible scope of land-use restrictions. In my opinion, however, it is the Due Process Clause rather than that doctrine that protects the property owner from improperly motivated, unfairly conducted, or unnecessarily protracted governmental decisionmaking. Violation of the procedural safeguards mandated by the Due Process Clause will give rise to actions for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983, but I am not persuaded that delays in the development of property that are occasioned by fairly conducted administrative or judicial proceedings are compensable, except perhaps in the most unusual circumstances. On the contrary, I am convinced that the public interest in having important governmental decisions made in an orderly, fully informed way amply justifies the temporary burden on the citizen that is the inevitable by-product of democratic government. [482 U.S. 304, 340]\nAs I recently wrote:\nI respectfully dissent.\n[ Footnote 1 ] The Superior Court's entire explanation for its decision to grant the motion to strike reads as follows:\n[ Footnote 2 ] The Court of Appeal described the Agins case in this way:\n[ Footnote 3 ] \"The familiar rule of appellate court procedure in federal courts [is] that, without a cross-petition or appeal, a respondent or appellee may support the judgment in his favor upon grounds different from those upon which the court below rested its decision.\" McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale, 309 U.S. 430, 434 (1940), citing United States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U.S. 425, 435 (1924); see also Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 475 -476, n. 6 (1970). It is also well settled that this Court is not bound by a state court's determination (much less an assumption) that a complaint states a federal claim. See Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 318 (1958); First National Bank of Guthrie Center v. Anderson, [482 U.S. 304, 325] 269 U.S. 341, 346 (1926). Especially in the takings context, where the details of the deprivation are so significant, the economic drain of litigation on public resources is \"too great to permit cases to go forward without a more substantial indication that a constitutional violation may have occurred.\" Pace Resources, Inc. v. Shrewsbury Township, 808 F.2d 1023, 1026 (CA3), cert. denied, post, p. 906.\n[ Footnote 4 ] See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 485 -493 (1987) (coal mine subsidence); Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962) (rock quarry excavation); Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272 (1928) (infectious tree disease); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (emissions from factory); Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887) (intoxicating liquors); see also Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 145 (1978) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (\"The question is whether the forbidden use is dangerous to the safety, health, or welfare of other\"). Many state courts have reached the identical conclusion. See Keystone Bituminous, supra, at 492, n. 22 (citing cases).\nIn Keystone Bituminous we explained that one of the justifications for the rule that health and safety regulation cannot constitute a taking is that individuals hold their property subject to the limitation that they not use it in dangerous or noxious ways. 480 U.S., at 491 , n. 20. The Court's recent decision in United States v. Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, 480 U.S. 700 (1987), adds support to this thesis. There, the Court reaffirmed the traditional rule that when the United States exercises its power to assert a [482 U.S. 304, 326] navigational servitude it does not \"take\" property because the damage sustained results \"from the lawful exercise of a power to which the interests of riparian owners have always been subject.\" Id., at 704.\n[ Footnote 5 ] See generally Plater, The Takings Issue in a Natural Setting: Floodlines and the Police Power, 52 Tex. L. Rev. 201 (1974); F. Bosselman, D. Callies, & J. Banta, The Taking Issue 147-155 (1973).\n[ Footnote 6 ] It is proper to take judicial notice of the ordinance. It provides, in relevant part:\n[ Footnote 7 ] Because the complaint did not pray for an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance, or a declaration that it is invalid, but merely sought monetary relief, it is doubtful that we have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257(2). Section 1257(2) provides:\n[ Footnote 8 ] In United States v. Dow, 357 U.S. 17 (1958), the United States had \"entered into physical possession and began laying the pipe line through [482 U.S. 304, 332] the tract.\" Id., at 19. In Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1 (1949), the United States Army had taken possession of the laundry plant including all \"the facilities of the company, except delivery equipment.\" Id., at 3. In United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372 (1946), the United States acquired by condemnation a building occupied by tenants and ordered the tenants to vacate. In United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373 (1945), the Government occupied a portion of a leased building.\n[ Footnote 9 ] The Court makes only a feeble attempt to explain why the holdings in Agins and Danforth are not controlling here. It is tautological to claim that the cases stand for the \"unexceptional proposition that the valuation of property which has been taken must be calculated as of the time of the taking.\" Ante, at 320 (emphasis added). The question in Danforth was when the taking occurred. The question addressed in the relevant portion of Agins was whether the temporary fluctuations in value themselves constituted a taking. In rejecting the claims in those cases, the Court necessarily held that the temporary effects did not constitute taking of their own right. The cases are therefore directly on point here. If even the temporary effects of a decision to condemn, the ultimate taking, do not ordinarily constitute a taking in and of themselves, then, a fortiori, the temporary effects of a regulation should not.\n[ Footnote 10 ] Whether delays associated with a judicial proceeding that terminates with a holding that a regulation was not authorized by state law would be a \"normal delay\" or a temporary taking depends, I suppose, on the unexplained rationale for the Court's artificial distinction.\n[ Footnote 11 ] \"[T]he Constitution measures a taking of property not by what a State says, or what it intends, but by what it does.\" Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 298 (1967) (Stewart, J., concurring). The fact that the effects of the regulation are stopped by judicial, as opposed to administrative decree, should not affect the question whether compensation is required.\n[ Footnote 12 ] States may surely provide a forum in their courts for review of general challenges to zoning ordinances and other regulations. Such a procedure then becomes part of the \"normal\" process. Indeed, when States have set up such procedures in their courts, we have required resort to those processes before considering takings claims. See Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172 (1985).\n[ Footnote 13 ] See, e. g., Mandelker, Land Use Takings: The Compensation Issue, 8 Hastings Const. L. Q. 491 (1981); Williams, Smith, Siemon, Mandelker, & Babcock, The White River Junction Manifesto, 9 Vt. L. Rev. 193, 233-234 [482 U.S. 304, 336] (1984); Berger & Kanner, Thoughts on the White River Junction Manifesto: A Reply to the \"Gang of Five's\" Views on Just Compensation for Regulatory Taking of Property, 19 Loyola (LA) L. Rev. 685, 704-712 (1986); Comment, Just Compensation or Just Invalidation: The Availability of a Damages Remedy in Challenging Land Use Regulations, 29 UCLA L. Rev. 711, 725-726 (1982).\n[ Footnote 14 ] For this same reason, the parties' and amici's conflicting claims about whether this Court's cases, such as Hurley v. Kincaid, 285 U.S. 95 (1932), provide that compensation is a less intrusive remedy than invalidation, are not relevant here.\n[ Footnote 15 ] The California Supreme Court's discussion of the policy implications in Agins is entirely consistent with the view that the court was choosing between remedies (invalidation or compensation) with respect to the permanent effect of a regulation, and was not dealing with the temporary taking question at all. Subsequent California Supreme Court cases applying the Agins rule do not shed light on this question.\n[ Footnote 16 ] In the habeas corpus context, we have held that a prisoner has not exhausted his state remedies when the state court refuses to consider his [482 U.S. 304, 339] claim because he has not sought the appropriate state remedy. See Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211, 216 (1946); Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 116 -117 (1944). This rule should be applied with equal force here.\n[ Footnote 17 ] It is no answer to say that \"[a]fter all, if a policeman must know the Constitution, then why not a planner?\" San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U.S. 621, 661 , n. 26 (1981) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). To begin with, the Court has repeatedly recognized that it itself cannot establish any objective rules to assess when a regulation becomes a taking. See Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 713 -714 (1987); Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 65 (1979); Penn Central, 438 U.S., at 123 -124. How then can it demand that land planners do any better? However confusing some of our criminal procedure cases may be, I do not believe they have been as openended and standardless as our regulatory takings cases are. As one commentator concluded: \"The chaotic state of taking law makes it especially likely that availability of the damages remedy will induce land-use planning [482 U.S. 304, 341] officials to stay well back of the invisible line that they dare not cross.\" Johnson, Compensation for Invalid Land-Use Regulations, 15 Ga. L. Rev. 559, 594 (1981); see also Sallet, The Problem of Municipal Liability for Zoning and Land-Use Regulation, 31 Cath. U. L. Rev. 465, 478 (1982); Charles v. Diamond, 41 N. Y. 2d 318, 331-332, 360 N. E. 2d 1295, 1305 (1977); Allen v. City and County of Honolulu, 58 Haw. 432, 439, 571 P.2d 328, 331 (1977).\nAnother critical distinction between police activity and land-use planning is that not every missed call by a policeman gives rise to civil liability; police officers enjoy individual immunity for actions taken in good faith. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982); Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183 (1984). Moreover, municipalities are not subject to civil liability for police officers' routine judgment errors. See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). In the land regulation context, however, I am afraid that any decision by a competent regulatory body may establish a \"policy or custom\" and give rise to liability after today.

{"text": "220 U.S. 373\nDR. MILES MEDICAL COMPANY, Petitioner,\nJOHN D. PARK & SONS COMPANY.\nArgued January 4 and 5, 1911.\nDecided April 3, 1911.\n[220 U.S. 373, 374] This is a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit which affirmed a judgment of the circuit court, dismissing, on demurrer, the bill of complaint for want of equity. 90 C. C. A. 579, 164 Fed. 803.\nThe complainant, Dr. Miles Medical Company, an Indiana corporation, if engaged in the manufacture and sale of proprietary medicines, prepared by means of secret methods and formulas, and identified by distinctive packages, labels, and trademarks. It has established an extensive trade throughout the United States and in certain foreign countries. It has been its practice to sell its medicines to jobbers and wholesale druggists, who in turn sell to retail druggists for sale to the consumer. In the case of each remedy, it has fixed not only the price of its own sales to jobbers and wholesale dealers, but also the wholesale and retail prices. The bill alleged that most of its sales were made through retail druggists, and that the demand for its remedies largely depended upon their [220 U.S. 373, 375] good will and commendation, and their ability to realize a fair profit; that certain retail establishments, particularly those known as department stores, had inaugurated a 'cutrate' or 'cut-price' system which had caused 'much confusion, trouble, and damage' to the complainant's business, and 'injuriously affected the reputation' and 'depleted the sales' of its remedies; that this injury resulted 'from the fact that the majority of retail druggists as a rule cannot, or believe that they cannot, realize sufficient profits' by the sale of the medicines 'at the cut-prices announced by the cut-rate and department stores,' and therefore are 'unwilling to, and do not keep' the medicines 'in stock,' or, 'if kept in stock, do not urge or favor sales thereof, but endeavor to foist off some similar remedy or substitute, and from the fact that in the public mind an article advertised or announced at 'cut' or 'reduced' price from the established price suffers loss of reputation and becomes of inferior value and demand.'\nIt was further alleged that for the purpose of protecting 'its trade sales and business' and of conserving 'its good will and reputation,' the complainant had established a method 'of governing, regulating, and controlling the sale and marketing' of its remedies, which is thus described in the bill:\nAs an aid to the maintenance of the prices thus fixed, the company devised a system for tracing and identifying, through serial numbers and cards, each wholesale and retail package of its products.\nIt was alleged that all wholesale and retail druggists, 'and all dealers in proprietary medicines,' had been given full opportunity, without discrimination, to sign contracts in the form stated, and that such contracts were in force between the complainant 'and over four hundred jobbers and wholesalers and twenty-five thousand retail dealers in proprietary medicines in the United States.'\nThe defendant is a Kentucky corporation conducting a wholesale drug business. The bill alleged that the defendant had formerly dealt with the complainant, and had full knowledge of all the facts relating to the trade in its medicines; that it had been requested, and refused, to enter into the wholesale contract required by the complainant; that in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, where the defendant conducted a wholesale drug store, there were a large number of wholesale and retail druggists who had made contracts of the sort described, with the complainant, and kept its medicines on sale pursuant to the agreed terms and conditions. It was charged that the defendant, 'in combination and conspiracy with a number of wholesale and retail dealers in drugs and proprietary medicines, who have not entered into said wholesale and retail contracts' required by the complainant's system, and solely for the purpose of selling the remedies to dealers 'to be advertised, sold, and marketed at cut rates,' and 'to thus attract and secure custom and patronage for other merchandise, and not for the purpose of making or receiving a direct money profit' from the [220 U.S. 373, 382] sales of the remedies, had unlawfully and fraudulently procured them from the complainant's 'wholesale and retail agents' by means 'of false and fraudulent representations and statements, and by surreptitious and dishonest methods, and by persuading and inducing, directly and indirectly,' a violation of their contracts.\nIt is further charged that the defendant, having procured the remedies in this manner, had advertised and sold them at less than the jobbing and retail prices established by the complainant; and that, for the purpose of concealing the source of supply, the identifying serial numbers, which had been stamped upon the labels and cartons, had been obliterated by the defendant or by those acting in collusion with the defendant, and the labels and cartons had been mutilated, thus rendering the list of ailments and directions for use illegible, and that the remedies in this condition were sold both to the wholesale and retail dealers, and ultimately to buyers for use at cut rates.\nThe bill prayed for an injunction restraining the defendant from inducing or attempting to induce any party to any of the said 'wholesale or retail agency contracts' to 'violate or break the same, or to sell or deliver to the defendant, or to any person for it,' the complainant's remedies; from procuring or attempting to procure in any way any of these remedies from wholesale or retail dealers who had executed the contracts; from advertising, selling, or offering for sale the remedies obtained by any of the described means at less 'than the established retail price thereof,' or to dealers who had not entered into contract with the complainant; from in any way obliterating, mutilating, removing, or covering up the labels and cartons upon the bottles containing the remedies, and from making sales without such labels and cartons, and the letter press and numerals thereon, being intact. There was also a prayer for an accounting. [220 U.S. 373, 383] The defendant demurred to the bill generally for want of equity, and also specially to that portion of the bill which related to the mutilation and destruction of the identifying numbers and labels.\nThe circuit court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the bill, and its judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals.\nMessrs. Frank F. Reed and Edward S. Rogers for petitioner.\n[220 U.S. 373, 389] Messrs. Alton B. Parker and William J. Shroder for respondent.\nMr. Justice Hughes, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\nThe complainant, a manufacturer of proprietary medicines which are prepared in accordance with seeret formulas, presents by its bill a system, carefully devised, by which it seeks to maintain certain prices fixed by it for all the sales of its products, both at wholesale and retail. Its purpose is to establish minimum prices at which sales shall be made by its vendees and by all subsequent purchasers who traffic in its remedies. Its plan is thus to govern directly the entire trade in the medicines it manufactures, embracing interstate commerce as well as commerce within the state respectively. To accomplish this result it has adopted two forms of restrictive agreements limiting trade in the articles to those who become parties to one or the other. The one sort of contract, known as 'Consignment Contract-Wholesale,' has been made with over four hundred jobbers and wholesale dealers, and the other described as 'Retail Agency Contract,' with twenty-five thousand retail dealers in the United States.\nThe defendant is a wholesale drug concern which has refused to enter into the required contract, and is charged with procuring medicines for sale at 'cut prices' by inducing those who have made the contracts to violate the restrictions. The complainant invokes the established doctrine that an actionable wrong is committed by one who maliciously interferes with a contract between two parties, and induces one of them to break that contract, to the injury of the other, and that, in the absence of an ade- [220 U.S. 373, 395] quate remedy at law, equitable relief will be granted. Angle v. Chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. 151 U.S. 1 , 38 L. ed. 55, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240; Bitterman v. Louisville & N. R. Co. 207 U.S. 205 , 52 L. ed. 171, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 91, 12 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 693.\nThe principal question is as to the validity of the restrictive agreements.\nPreliminarily there are opposing contentions as to the construction of the agreements, or, at least, of that made with jobbers and wholesale dealers. The complainant insists that the 'consignment contract' contemplates a true consignment for sale for account of the complainant, and that those who make sales under it are the complainant's agents, and not its vendees. The court below did not so construe the agreement, and considered it an effort 'to disguise the wholesale dealers in the mask of agency, upon the theory that in that character one link in the system for the suppression of the 'cut rate' business might be regarded as valid,' and that under this agreement 'the jobber must be regarded as the general owner, and engaged in selling for himself, and not as a mere agent of another.' 90 C. C. A. 581, 164 Fed. p. 805.\nThere are certain allegations in the bill which do not accord with the complainant's argument. Thus, it is alleged that it 'has been and is the uniform custom' of the complainant 'to sell said medicines, remedies, and cures to jobbers and wholesale druggists, who in turn sell and dispose of the same to retail druggists for sale and distribution to the ultimate purchaser or consumer.' And in setting forth the form of the agreement in question it is alleged that it was 'required to be executed by all jobbers and wholesale druggists to whom your orator sold its aforesaid remedies, medicines, and cures.' It is further stated that, as a means of maintaining 'said list of prices,' cards bearing serial identifying numbers are placed in each package of remedies 'sold to jobbers and wholesale druggists.' But it is also alleged in the bill that under the provisions [220 U.S. 373, 396] of the contract the title to the medicines remained in the complainant 'until actual sale in good faith to retail dealers, as therein provided.'\nTurning to the agreement itself, we find that it purports to appoint the party with whom it is made one of the complainant's 'wholesale distributing agents,' and it is agreed that the complainant, as proprietor, shall consign to the agent 'for sale for the account of said proprietor' such goods as it may deem necessary, 'the title thereto to remain in the proprietor absolutely until sold under and in accordance with the provisions hereof, and all unsold goods to be immediately returned to said proprietor on demand and the cancelation of this agreement.' The goods are to be invoiced to the consignee at stated prices, which are the same as the minimum prices at which the consignee is allowed to sell. It is also agreed that the consignee shall 'faithfully and promptly account and pay to the proprietor the proceeds of all sales, after deducting as full compensation . . . a commission of 10 per cent of the invoice value, and a further commission of 5 per cent on the net amount of each consignment after deducting the said 10 per cent commission on all advances on account remitted within ten days from the date of any consignment,' such advances, however, not to affect the title to the goods, and to be repaid should the agreement be terminated and unsold goods, on which advances had been made, be returned. The consignee guarantees payment for all goods sold, and promises 'to render a full account and remit the net proceeds on the first day of each month of and for the sales of the month preceding.'\nThe consignee agrees 'to sell only to the designated retail agents of said proprietor, as specified in lists of such retail agents furnished by said proprietor, and alterable at the will of said proprietor.' A further provision permits sales 'only to the said retail or wholesale agents [220 U.S. 373, 397] of said proprietor, as per list furnished.' No time is fixed for the duration of the agreement.\nIt is urged that the additional commission of 5 per cent is to induce, through the guise of 'advances,' payment for the goods before sales are made, and that unsold goods are to be returned only on the complainant's demand and the cancelation of the agreement. But the consignee is not bound to make these 'advances,' and it is distinctly provided that he shall not acquire title by making them. It is also said that the consignee may sell at prices higher than those listed, but he is bound by the agreement to account for 'the proceeds of all slaes,' less the stipulated commissions. Nor is the provision as to the time for accounting and remittance of net proceeds to be regarded as inconsistent with agency, in the absence of a showing that, in the actual transactions and accounts, the consignee was treated as selling on his own behalf and paying as purchaser.\nIf, however, we consider the 'consignment contract' as one which in legal effect provides for consignments of goods to be sold by an agent for his principal's account, and that the tenor of the agreement, as set forth, must be taken to override the inconsistent general allegations to which we have referred, this alone would not be sufficient to support the bill.\nThe bill charges that the defendant has unlawfully and fraudulently procured the proprietary medicines from the complainant's 'wholesale and retail agents' in violation of their contracts. But it does not allege that the goods procured by the defendant from 'wholesale agents' were goods consigned to the latter for sale. The description 'wholesale agent' refers to those who have signed the 'consignment contract.' This contract, however, permits one 'wholesale agent' to sell to another 'wholesale agent.' For all that appears, the goods procured by the defendant may have been purchased by the defendant's [220 U.S. 373, 398] vendors from other wholesale agents. The bill avers that prior to the introduction of the described system, the defendant, a wholesale house, had dealt in the remedies, and had purchased them from the complainant and from 'wholesale druggists and jobbers.' There is nothing in the bill which is inconsistent with such an actual course of dealing, permitted by the agreement itself, with respect to the wholesale dealers who have signed it. But the goods which one wholesale agent purchased from another wholesale agent would not be held for sale as consigned goods belonging to the complainant, and to be accounted for as such; and their sale by the wholesale dealer, who had acquired title, would be made for his own account, and not for that of the complainant. The allegations of the bill and the plain purpose of the system of contracts do not permit the conclusion that it was intended that wholesale dealers purchasing goods in this way should be free to sell to anyone at any price. Evidently it was not contemplated that the restrictions of the system should be escaped in such a simple manner. But if the restrictions of the 'consignment contract' as to prices and vendees are to be deemed to apply to the sale of goods which one wholesale dealer has purchased from another, it is evident that the validity of the restrictions in this aspect must be supported on some other ground than that such sale is made by the wholesale dealer as the agent of the complainant. The case presented by the bill cannot properly be regarded as one for inducing breach of trust by an agent.\nThe other form of contract adopted by the complainant, while described as a 'retail agency contract,' is clearly an agreement looking to sale, and not to agency. The so-called 'retail agents' are not agents at all, either of the complainant or of its consignees, but are contemplated purchasers who buy to sell again; that is, retail dealers. It is agreed that they may purchase the medicines manu- [220 U.S. 373, 399] factured by the complainant at stated prices. There follows this stipulation:\nIt will be noticed that the 'retail agents' are not forbidden to sell either to wholesale or retail dealers if these are 'accredited agents' of the complainant, that is, if the dealers have signed either of the two contracts the complainant requires. But the restriction is intended to apply whether the retail dealers have bought the goods from those who held under consignment or from other dealers, wholesale or retail, who had purchased them. And in which way the 'retail agents' who supplied the medicines to the defendant had bought them is not shown.\nThe bill asserts complainant's 'right to maintain and preserve the aforesaid system and method of contracts and sales adopted and established by it.' It is, as we have seen, a system of interlocking restrictions by which the complainant seeks to control not merely the prices at which its agents may sell its products, but the prices for all sales by all dealers at wholesale or retail, whether purchasers or subpurchasers, and thus to fix the amount which the consumer shall pay, eliminating all competition. The essential features of such a system are thus described by Mr. Justice Lurton (then circuit judge), in the opinion of the circuit court of appeals in the case of John D. Park & Sons Co. v. Hartman, 12 L.R.A.(N.S.) on page 147, 82 C. C. A. 158, 153 Fed. 24: 'The contracting wholesalers or jobbers covenant that they will sell to no one who does not come with complainant's license to buy, and that they will not sell [220 U.S. 373, 400] below a minimum price dictated by complainant. Next, all competition between retailers is destroyed, for each such retailer can obtain his supply only by signing one of the uniform contracts prepared for retailers, whereby he covenants not to sell to anyone who proposes to sell again unless the buyer is authorized in writing by the complainant, and not to sell at less than a standard price named in the agreement. Thus all room for competition between retailers, who supply the public, is made impossible. If these contracts leave any room at any point of the line for the usual play of competition between the dealers in the product marketed by complainant, it is not discoverable. Thus a combination between the manufacturer, the wholesalers, and the retailers, to maintain prices and stifle competition, has been brought about.'\nThat these agreements restrain trade is obvious. That, having been made, as the bill alleges, with 'most of the jobbers and wholesale druggists and a majority of the retail druggists of the country,' and having for their purpose the control of the entire trade, they relate directly to interstate as well as intrastate trade, and operate to restrain trade or commerce among the several states, is also clear. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211 , 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96; E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co. 186 U.S. 92 , 46 L. ed. 1069, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747; W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, 193 U.S. 38 , 48 L. ed. 608, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375 , 49 L. ed. 518, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276.\nBut it is insisted that the restrictions are not invalid either at common law or under the act of Congress of July 2, 1890, chap. 647, 26 Stat. at L. 209, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200, upon the following grounds, which may be taken to embrace the fundamental contentions for the complainant: (1) That the restrictions are valid because they relate to proprietary medicines manufactured under a secret process; and (2) that, apart from this, a manufacturer is entitled to control the prices on all sales of his own products.\nFirst. The first inquiry is whether there is any dis- [220 U.S. 373, 401] tinction, with respect to such restrictions as are here presented, between the case of an article manufactured by the owner of a secret process and that of one produced under ordinary conditions. The complainant urges an analogy to right secured by letters patent. E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co. 186 U.S. 70 , 46 L. ed. 1058, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747. In the case cited, there were licenses for the manufacture and sale of articles covered by letters patent, with stipulations as to the prices at which the licensee should sell. The court said, referring to the act of July 2, 1890 ( p. 92): 'But that statute clearly does not refer to that kind of a restraint of interstate commerce which may arise from reasonable and legal conditions imposed upon the assignee or licensee of a patent by the owner thereof, restricting the terms upon which the article may be used and the price to be demanded therefor. Such a construction of the act we have no doubt was never contemplated by its framers.'\nBut whatever rights the patentee may enjoy are derived from statutory grant under the authority conferred by the Constitution. This grant is based upon public considerations. The purpose of the patent law is to stimulate invention by protecting inventors for a fixed time in the advantages that may be derived from exclusive manufacture, use, and sale. As was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. pp. 241- 243, 8 L. ed. 384, 385: 'It is the reward stipulated for the advantages derived by the public for the exertions of the individual, and is intended as a stimulus to those exertions. . . . The public yields nothing which it has not agreed to yield; it receives all which it has contracted to receive. The full benefit of the discovery, after its enjoyment by the discoverer for fourteen years, is preserved; and for his exclusive enjoyment of it during that time the public faith is pledged. . . . The great object and intention of the act is to secure to the public the advantages to be derived from the discoveries of individuals, and the means it employs are the com- [220 U.S. 373, 402] pensation made to those individuals for the time and labor devoted to these discoveries, by the exclusive right to make, use, and sell the things discovered for a limited time.'\nThe complainant has no statutory grant. So far as appears, there are no letters patent relating to the remedies in question. The complainant has not seen fit to make the disclosure required by the statute, and thus to secure the privileges it confers. Its case lies outside the policies of the patent law, and the extent of the right which that law secures is not here involved or determined.\nThe complainant relies upon the ownership of its secret process and its rights are to be determined accordingly. Anyone may use it who fairly, by analysis and experiment, discovers it. But the complainant is entitled to be protected against invasion of its rights in the process by fraud or by breach of trust or contract. Tabor v. Hoffman, 118 N. Y. 36, 16 Am. St. Rep. 740, 23 N. E. 12; Chadwick v. Covell, 151 Mass. 190, 6 L.R.A. 839, 21 Am. St. Rep. 442, 23 N. E. 1068. The secret process may be the subject of confidential communication and of sale or license to use with restrictions as to territory and prices. Fowle v. Park, 131 U.S. 88 , 33 L. ed. 67, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 658. A similar principle obtains with respect to the confidential communication of quotations collected by a board of trade. Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co. 198 U.S. 236 , 49 L. ed. 1031, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 637.\nHere, however, the question concerns not the process of manufacture, but the manufactured product,-an article of commerce. The complainant has not communicated its process in trust, or under contract, or executed a license for the use of the process with restrictions as to the manufacturer and sale by the licensee to whom the communication is made. The complainant has retained its secret, which apparently it believes to be undiscoverable. Whether its remedies are sold or unsold, whether the restrictions as to future sales are valid or invalid, the complainant's secret remains intact. That the complainant may rightfully ob- [220 U.S. 373, 403] ject to attempts to discover it by fraudulent means, or to a breach of trust or contract relating to the process, does not require the conclusion that it is entitled to establish restrictions with respect to future sales by those who purchase its manufactured product. It is said that the remedies 'embody' the secret. It would be more correct to say that they are manufactured according to the secret process, and do not constitute a communication of it. It is also urged that, as the process is secret, no one else can manufacture the article. But this argument rests on monopoly of production, and not on the secrecy of the process or the particular fact that may confer that monopoly. It implies that if, for any reason, monopoly of production exists, it carries with it the right to control the entire trade of the produced article, and to prevent any competition that otherwise might arise between wholesale and retail dealers. The principle would not be limited to secret processes, but would extend to goods manufactured by anyone who secured control of the source of supply of a necessary raw material or ingredient. But, because there is monopoly of production, it certainly cannot be said that there is no public interest in maintaining freedom of trade with respect to future sales after the article has been placed on the market and the producer has parted with his title. Moreover, every manufacturer, before sale, controls the articles he makes. With respect to these, he has the rights of ownership, and his dominion does not depend upon whether the process of manufacture is known or unknown, or upon any special advantage he may possess by reason of location, materials, or efficiency. The fact that the market may not be supplied with the particular article unless he produces it is a practical consequence which does not enlarge his right of property in what he does produce.\nIf a manufacturer, in the absence of statutory privilege, has the control over the sales of the manufactured article [220 U.S. 373, 404] for which the complainant here contends, it is not because the process of manufacture is kept secret. In this respect, the maker of so-called proprietary medicines, unpatented, stands on no different footing from that of other manufacturers. The fact that the article is represented to be curative in its properties does not justify a restriction of trade which would be unlawful as to compositions designed for other purposes.\nSecond. We come, then, to the second question,-whether the complainant, irrespective of the secrecy of its process, is entitled to maintain the restrictions by virtue of the fact that they relate to products of its own manufacture.\nThe basis of the argument appears to be that, as the manufacturer may make and sell, or not, as he chooses, he may affix conditions as to the use of the article or as to the prices at which purchasers may dispose of it. The propriety of the restraint is sought to be derived from the liberty of the producer.\nBut because a manufacturer is not bound to make or sell, it does not follow in case of sales actually made he may impose upon purchasers every sort of restriction. Thus, a general restraint upon alienation is ordinarily invalid. 'The right of alienation is one of the essential incidents of a right of general property in movables, and restraints upon alienation have been generally regarded as obnoxious to public policy, which is best subserved by great freedom of traffic in such things as pass from hand to hand. General restraint in the alienation of articles, things, chattels, except when a very special kind of property is involved, such as a slave or an heirloom, have been generally held void. 'If a man,' says Lord Coke, in 2 Coke on Littleton, 360, 'be possessed . . . of a horse or of any other chattel, real or personal, and give or sell his whole interest or property therein, upon condition that the donee or vendee shall not alien the same, the same is void, because the whole interest and property is out of him, so as he hath [220 U.S. 373, 405] no possibility of a reverter; and it is against trade and traffic and bargaining and contracting between man and man.\" John D. Park & Sons Co. v. Hartman, 12 L.R.A.(N.S.) 146, 82 C. C. A. 158, 153 Fed. 24. See also Gray, Restraints on Alienation of Property, 27, 28.\nNor can the manufacturer by rule and notice, in the absence of contract or statutory right, even though the restriction be known to purchasers, fix prices for future sales. It has been held by this court that no such privilege exists under the copyright statutes, although the owner of the copyright has the sole right to vend copies of the copyrighted production. Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339 , 52 L. ed. 1086, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722. There the court said (p. 351): 'The owner of the copyright in this case did sell copies of the book in quantities and at a price satisfactory to it. It has exercised the right to vend. What the complainant contends for embraces not only the right to sell the copies, but to qualify the title of a future purchaser by the reservation of the right to have the remedies of the statute against an infringer because of the printed notice of its purpose so to do unless the purchaser sells at a price fixed in the notice. To add to the right of exclusive sale the authority to control all future retail sales, by a notice that such sales must be made at a fixed sum, would give a right not included in the terms of the statute, and, in our view, extend its operation, by construction, beyond its meaning, when interpreted with a view to ascertaining the legislative intent in its enactment.' It will hardly be contended, with respect to such a matter, that the manufacturer of an article of commerce not protected by any statutory grant is in any better case. See Taddy & Co. v. Sterious & Co. [220 U.S. 373, 1904] 1 Ch. 354; McGruther v. Pitcher [220 U.S. 373, 1904] 2 Ch. 306; Garst v. Hall & L. Co. 179 Mass. 588, 55 L.R.A. 631, 61 N. E. 219. Whatever right the manufacturer may have to project his control beyond his own sales must depend not upon an inherent power incident to production and original ownership, but upon agreement. [220 U.S. 373, 406] With respect to contracts in restraint of trade, the earlier doctrine of the common law has been substantially modified in adaptation to modern conditions. But the public interest is still the first consideration. To sustain the restraint, it must be found to be reasonable both with respect to the public and to the parties, and that it is limited to what is fairly necessary, in the circumstances of the particular case, for the protection of the covenantee. Otherwise restraints of trade are void as against public policy. As was said by this court in Gibbs v. Consolidated Gas. Co. 130 U.S. 409 , 32 L. ed. 984, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553: 'The decision in Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181, s. c. 1 Smith, Lead. Cas. 7th Eng. ed. 407; 8th Am. ed. 756, is the foundation of the rule in relation to the invalidity of contracts in restraint of trade; but as it was made under a condition of things and a state of society different from those which now prevail, the rule laid down is not regarded as inflexible, and has been considerably modified. Public welfare is first considered, and if it be not involved, and the restraint upon one party is not greater than protection to the other party requires, the contract may be sustained. The question is whether, under the particular circumstances of the case and the nature of the particular contract involved in it, the contract is, or is not, unreasonable. Rousillon v. Rousillon, L. R. 14 Ch. Div. 351; Leather Cloth Co. v. Lorsont, L. R. 9 Eq. 345.'\nThe present case is not analogous to that of a sale of good will, or of an interest in a business, or of the grant of a right to use a process of manufacture. The complainant has not parted with any interest in its business or instrumentalities of production. It has conferred no right by virtue of which purchasers of its products may compete with it. It retains complete control over the business in which it is engaged, manufacturing what it pleases and fixing such prices for its own sales as it may desire. Nor are we dealing with a single transaction, conceivably unrelated to the public interest. The agreements are designed to maintain prices after the complainant has parted with the title to the articles, and to prevent competition among those who trade in them.\nThe bill asserts the importance of a standard retail price, and alleges generally that confusion and damage have resulted from sales at less than the prices fixed. But the advantage of established retail prices primarily concerns the dealers. The enlarged profits which would result from adherence to the established rates would go to them, and not to the complainant. It is through the inability of the favored dealers to realize these profits, on account of the described competition, that the complainant works out its alleged injury. If there be an advantage to the manufacturer in the maintenance of fixed retail prices, the question remains whether it is one which he is entitled to secure by agreements restricting the freedom of trade on the part of dealers who own what they [220 U.S. 373, 408] sell. As to this, the complainant can fare no better with its plan of identical contracts than could the dealers themselves if they formed a combination and endeavored to establish the same restrictions, and thus to achieve the same result, by agreement with each other. If the immediate advantage they would thus obtain would not be sufficient to sustain such a direct agreement, the asserted ulterior benefit to the complainant cannot be regarded as sufficient to support its system.\nBut agreements or combinations between dealers, having for their sole purpose the destruction of competition and the fixing of prices, are injurious to the public interest and void. They are not saved by the advantages which the participants expect to derive from the enhanced price to the consumer. People v. Sheldon, 139 N. Y. 251, 23 L.R.A. 221, 36 Am. St. Rep. 690, 34 N. E. 785; Judd v. Harrington, 139 N. Y. 105, 34 N. E. 790; People v. Milk Exch. 145 N. Y. 267, 27 L.R.A. 437, 45 Am. St. Rep. 609, 39 N. E. 1062; United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. 46 L.R.A. 122, 29 C. C. A. 141, 54 U. S. App. 723, 85 Fed. 271, on appeal 175 U.S. 211 , 44 L. ed. 136, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96; W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, 193 U.S. 38 , 48 L. ed. 608, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307; Chapin v. Brown Bros. 83 Iowa, 156, 12 L.R.A. 428, 32 Am. St. Rep. 297, 48 N. W. 1074; Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Ill. 346, 22 Am. Rep. 171; W. H. Hill Co. v. Gray & Worcester, -- Mich. --, 30 L.R.A.(N.S.) 327, 127 N. W. 803.\nThe complainant's plan falls within the principle which condemns contracts of this class. It, in effect, creates a combination for the prohibited purposes. No distinction can properly be made by reason of the particular character of the commodity in question. It is not entitled to special privilege or immunity. It is an article of commerce, and the rules concerning the freedom of trade must be held to apply to it. Nor does the fact that the margin of freedom is reduced by the control of production make the protection of what remains, in such a case, a negligible matter. And where commodities have passed into the channels of trade and are owned by dealers, the validity of agreements to prevent competition and to maintain prices is not to be determined by the circumstance whether they were produced by several manufacturers or by one, [220 U.S. 373, 409] or whether they were previously owned by one or by many. The complainant having sold its product at prices satisfactory to itself, the public is entitled to whatever advantage may be derived from competition in the subsequent traffic.\nThe questions involved were carefully considered and the decisions reviewed by Judge Lurton in delivering the opinion of the circuit court of appeals in John D. Park & Sons Co. v. Hartman, supra, and, in following that case, it was concluded below that the restrictions sought to be enforced by the bill were invalid both at common law and under the act of Congress of July 2, 1890. We think that the court was right.\nThe allegations of the bill as to the labels and cartons used by the complainant are evidently incidental to the main charge as to the procurement of violation of the restrictions as to prices and vendees contained in the agreement; and failing as to this, no case is made for relief with respect to the trademarks, which are not shown to have been infringed.\nMr. Justice Lurton took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\nThis is a bill to restrain the defendant from inducing, by corruption and fraud, agents of the plaintiff and purchasers from it to break their contracts not to sell its goods below a certain price. There are two contracts concerned. The first is that of the jobber or wholesale agent to whom the plaintiff consigns its goods; and I will say a few words about that, although it is not this branch of the case that induces me to speak. That they are agents, and not buyers, I understand to be conceded, and I do not see how it [220 U.S. 373, 410] can be denied. We have nothing before us but the form and the alleged effect of the written instrument, and they both are express that the title to the goods is to remain in the plaintiff until actual sale as permitted by the contract. So far as this contract limits the authority of the agents as agents, I do not understand its validity to be disputed. But it is construed also to permit the purchase of medicine by consignees from other consignees, and to make the specification of prices applicable to goods so purchased as well as to goods consigned. Hence, when the bill alleges that the defendant has obtained medicine from these agents by inducing them to break their contracts, the allegation does not require proof of breach of trust by an agent, but would be satisfied by proving a breach of promise in respect of goods that the consignee had bought and owned. This reasoning would have been conclusive in the days of Saunders if the construction of the contract is right, as I suppose that it is. But the contract as to goods purchased is at least in the background and obscure; it is not the main undertaking that the instrument is intended to express. I should have thought that the bill ought to be read as charging the defendant with inducing a breach of the ordinary duty of consignees as such (Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 395 , 49 S. L. ed. 518, 523, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276), and therefore as entitling the plaintiff to relief ( Angle v. Chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. 151 U.S. 1 , 38 L. ed. 55, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240).\nThe second contract is that of the retail agents, so called, being really the first purchasers, fixing the price below which they will not sell to the public. There is no attempt to attach a contract or condition to the goods, as in Bodds-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339 , 52 L. ed. 1086, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722, or in any way to restrict dealings with them after they leave the hands of the retail men. The sale to the retailers is made by the plaintiff, and the only question is whether the law forbids a purchaser to contract with his vendor that he will not sell [220 U.S. 373, 411] below a certain price. This is the important question in this case. I suppose that in the case of a single object, such as a painting or a statute, the right of the artist to make such a stipulation hardly would be denied. In other words, I suppose that the reason why the contract is held bad is that it is part of a scheme embracing other similar contracts, each of which applies to a number of similar things, with the object of fixing a general market price. This reason seems to me inadequate in the case before the court. In the first place, by a slight change in the form of the contract the plaintiff can accomplish the result in a way that would be beyond successful attack. if it should make the retail dealers also agents in law as well as in name, and retain the title until the goods left their hands, 1 cannot conceive that even the present enthusiasm for regulating the prices to be charged by other people would deny that the owner was acting within his rights. It seems to me that this consideration by itself ought to give us pause.\nBut I go farther. There is no statute covering the case; there is no body of precedent that, by ineluctable logic, requires the conclusion to which the court has come. The conclusion is reached by extending a certain conception of public policy to a new sphere. On such matters we are in perilous country. I think that at least it is safe to say that the most enlightened judicial policy is to let people manage their own business in their own way, unless the ground for interference is very clear. What, then, is the ground upon which we interfere in the present case? Of course, it is not the interest of the producer. No one, I judge, cares for that. It hardly can be the interest of subordinate vendors, as there seems to be no particular reason for preferring them to the originator and first vendor of the product. Perhaps it may be assumed to be the interest of the consumers and the public. On that point I confess that I am in a minority as to larger issues than [220 U.S. 373, 412] are concerned here. I think that we greatly exaggerate the value and importance to the public of competition in the production or distribution of an article (here it is only distribution) as fixing a fair price. What really fixes that is the competition of conflicting desires. We, none of us, can have as much as we want of all the things that we want. Therefore, we have to choose. As soon as the price of something that we want goes above the point at which we are willing to give up other things to have that, we cease to buy it and buy something else. Of course, I am speaking of things that we can get along without. There may be necessaries that sooner or later must be dealt with like short rations in a shipwreck, but they are not Dr. Miles's medicines. With regard to things like the latter, it seems to me that the point of most profitable returns marks the equilibrium of social desires, and determines the fair price in the only sense in which I can find meaning in those words. The Dr. Miles Medical Company knows better than we do what will enable it to do the best business. We must assume its retail price to be reasonable, for it is so alleged and the case is here on demurrer; so I see nothing to warrant my assuming that the public will not be served best by the company being allowed to carry out its plan. I cannot believe that in the long run the public will profit by this court permitting knaves to cut reasonable prices for some ulterior purpose of their own, and thus to impair, if not to destroy, the production and sale of articles which it is assumed to be desirable that the public should be able to get.\nThe conduct of the defendant falls within a general prohibition of the law. It is fraudulent, and has no merits of its own to recommend it to the favor of the court. An injunction against a defendant's dealing in nontransferable round-trip reduced-rate tickets has been granted to a railroad company upon the general principles of the law protecting contracts, and the demoralization of rates has [220 U.S. 373, 413] been referred as a special circumstance in addition to the general grounds. Bitterman v. Louisville & N. R. Co. 207 U.S. 205 , 222-224, 52 L. ed. 171, 182, 183, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 91, 12 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 693. The general and special considerations equally apply here, and we ought not to disregard them, unless the evil effect of the contract is very plain. The analogy relied upon to establish that evil effect is that of combinations in restraint of trade. I believe that we have some superstitions on that head, as I have said; but those combinations are entered into with intent to exclude others from a business naturally open to them, and we unhappily have become familiar with the methods by which they are carried out. I venture to say that there is no likeness between them and this case (Jayne v. Loder, 7 L.R.A.(N.S.) 984, 78 C. C. A. 653, 149 Fed. 21, 27, 9 A. & E. Ann. Cas. 294), and I think that my view prevails in England (Elliman, Sons & Co. v. Carrington & Son [220 U.S. 373, 1901] 2 Ch. 275). See Garst v. Harris, 177 Mass. 72, 58 N. E. 174. Garst v. Charles, 187 Mass. 144, 72 N. E. 839. I think also that the importance of the question and the popularity of what I deem mistaken notions makes it my duty to express my view in this dissent.", "id": "<urn:uuid:69ab0a90-a9a8-4707-a98d-c6f6b5ffa854>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=220&page=408", "date": "2013-05-18T07:15:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9662017226219177, "token_count": 9967, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "A Mexican legal expert is calling for conscientious objector status for public employees who do not wish to cooperate with Mexico City’s new regime of homosexual “marriage.”\nAlberto Patiño Reyes, who holds a PhD in law, says that the Mexican juridical system “lacks an express recognition of the right of conscientious objection, which is a manifestation of a broader fundamental right, liberty of conscience.”\nPointing out that the Mexican government has signed the San Jose Covenant, which recognizes “the right of the person to liberty of conscience and religion,” Patiño Reyes opines that such a right should apply to any employee of the Mexican government who wishes to opt out of participation in homosexual “marriage.”\n“The recognition of conscientious objection for the celebration of matrimony for people of the same sex, would entail the possibility of substitution for the objector in the fulfillment of his functions, leaving intact his liberty of conscience,” he writes.\n“It is necessary to protect the officials of the Civil Registry, when the government becomes increasingly interventionist, legislating on issues with strong ethical content,” he adds. “In this case intending to equalize homosexual unions with the marriage of a man and a woman, under the pretext of equal rights, as well as an erroneous concept of the same, in a framework of moral relativism that is summarized in the maxim ‘if you like it, do it.’”\n“Legislation like this brings about the immediate result of imposing on the citizens an important moral contribution, with the consequent violation of their personal convictions.”\nMexico City’s government, which is dominated by the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, legislated the creation of homosexual “marriage” and adoption of children in December of last year, sparking expressions of outrage. A recent poll carried out by the conservative National Action Party found that a majority of Mexico City residents oppose the law\nThe federal government of Mexico, along with two state governors, are currently suing Mexico City over the law, contending that it is unconstitutional.", "id": "<urn:uuid:85d1e2e9-225b-4f6a-b6ba-82d2eaa93c85>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://catholicexchange.com/mexican-legal-expert-calls-for-objection-of-conscience-rights-in-face-of-gay-marriage/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:33Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9460241794586182, "token_count": 441, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative\nA national working group has begun the Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative (CCCII) to develop and disseminate resources and guidelines to assist Catholic elementary and secondary schools in integrating elements of Catholic identity (Catholic values, Scripture, Church social teachings, encyclicals, etc.) into curriculum and instruction based on the Common Core State Standards.\nThe initial phase of CCCII focuses on K-8 English/Language Arts/ Literacy. Resources for other subjects and for 9-12 curriculum will be developed in later phases.\nForty-six states have agreed to adopt the Common Core State Standards, a set of high quality K-12 learning standards that includes rigorous content and application of knowledge using higher-order thinking skills, leading students to college and career readiness. Currently, Catholic schools are assessing what the implications of the standards and accompanying assessments may be for them.\nWhile Catholic schools have their own local or diocesan standards, their ability to continue to provide high-quality education for their students is compelling them to consider adoption of the common core standards. Catholic schools will be impacted as curriculum resources and professional development opportunities become aligned with Common Core State Standards by producers of instructional materials, college teacher preparation programs, or regulations for participation in the federal programs that currently benefit their students and teachers. Within this environment, maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of the Catholic school will require integrating the demands of their mission and the academic expectations of their constituents and the wider education community.\nTo assist Catholic schools with enhancing Catholic identity integrated into the curriculum, the Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative (CCCII) has been launched as a collaborative project involving Catholic universities, corporations and sponsors invested in Catholic education, and the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA).\nThe Common Core Catholic Identity Initiative has two goals:\n- to empower Catholic schools and dioceses to design and direct the implementation of the Common Core standards within the culture and context of a Catholic school curriculum\n- to infuse the Common Core standards with the faith/principles/values/social justice themes inherent in the mission and Catholic identity of the school.\nThe CCCII project aims to accomplish its goals by creating a process and a product:\nPhase 1: Gather approximately 35 practitioners and curriculum and catechetics experts to pilot a CCCII ELA Unit development process to be shared with the larger Catholic educational community. (June 2012)\nPhase 2: Revise and refine the unit development process so that it can be replicated in dioceses around the country.\nPhase 3: Invite participation in development of additional CCCII ELA Units by Catholic educators around the country.\nPhase 1: Utilize the expertise and strength of experienced and innovative teachers to develop complete units/exemplars that join Catholic identify with the Common Core curriculum standards. Utilize the expertise of CCCII leaders to develop supporting resources and guidelines. (June 2012)\nPhase 2: Post exemplar units, guidelines, and resources developed in for the June 2012 launch for open access by Catholic educators on the Catholic School Standards Project Website www.catholicschoolsstandards.org) . (July 2012)\nPhase 3: Expand exemplar units and Catholic Identity resources available for use by local Catholic schools.\nTailor the CCCII Unit development process for Catholic secondary schools.\nExpand CCCII to include additional subject areas.\nMeet the CCCII Leadership and Planning Teams", "id": "<urn:uuid:1f81392d-3957-4ac5-9659-ed3112273a06>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://catholicschoolstandards.org/common-core-catholic-identity-initiative", "date": "2013-05-18T06:56:04Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9384240508079529, "token_count": 703, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "The bishops recommend a fmailiarity with good work done elsewhere. Sound advice:\n§ 193 § Before people make architectural and liturgical decisions, they need some experience of the broad spectrum of architectural designs already in new and renovated churches. People’s preferences are often determined by things with which they are familiar. Visits to a variety of churches can help them to develop a store of images that they can evaluate and consider as potential options for the building project in their own parish.\n§ 194 § Although the visits should not be confined to the work of architects or liturgical consultants under consideration for their project, people will want to visit churches that demonstrate the candidates’ work. Gaining knowledge of a professional’s previous work, whether religious or secular, is indispensable to the process of selecting the architect.\n§ 195 § When actual site visits are not possible, slides, videos, and other visual aids can expand the experience of those preparing for the building or renovation of a church. Liturgical and construction offices within the diocese also can be invaluable resources in advising parish building committees of recent or exemplary projects in the local area.\nOne important piece is to check the references of architects, contractors, and artists among church projects they have done. It is useful to get a good sense on how other churches have worked with professionals. In my current parish, we are looking to upgrade the sound system from the fire-damaged former set-up. In speaking with consultants, we were less impressed with eight-figure projects for convention centers, arenas, or even megachurches. We wanted people with church experience, preferably Catholic. We also asked churches for their assessment in working with professionals. A professional may do excellent work, but their interpersonal skills with a committee’s, a parish’s, and a pastor’s expectations need to also be a good match.\nAll texts from Built of Living Stones are copyright © 2000, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Inc.

{"text": "I've let you buggers off the hook for a few days, so today I'm going to talk about 'that stuff' again. Specifically about Altruism (aka unselfishness).\"Beware of altruism, it is based on self-deception, the root of all evil.\" HeinleinThe last temptation is the highest treason, to do the right thing for the wrong reason\" TS Eliot\nHeinlein was right to give his warning about altruism, because it is so hard to truly 'grok' ;>\nThe ancient Jewish tradition of Qabalah places Altruism in the second sphere - Chokmah, and unselfishness in the 7th, Netzach.\nFor those who have no clue what I'm talking about, The central element of the Qabalah is The tree of life, which is an abstract method of looking at the nature of The Universe, humanity and the Godhead. It is composed of ten spheres, the abyss of Da'ath and the paths between the spheres (called sepiroth). Malkuth , the tenth sphere is the Earthly Plane. Kether, the first sphere is the Crown, the Monad, the final rejoining with the Godhead in order to begin the cycle over once more.\nThe true goal of High Magick is to cleanse and purify the higher self, by enhancing ones virtues and eliminating vices. The Qabalah and the Wiccan degree systems both usually recognise this and are stuctured accordingly.\nUnselfishness is first studied in Netzach, in the form of unconditional love, mercy, beauty and splendor. It is studied in the Golden Dawn at grade 4=6, and in many Wiccan tradiitons as one of the Elemental Pacts - Fire (which depending upon the tradition may be done at 1st, 2nd or 3rd).\nTrue Altruism however is found within the final sphere before Kether - The sphere (or sephira) of Chockmah as mentioned above. And this is where the last temptation comes in to play. The temptation being to do the right thing (be generous in spirit, kind to others and help them however you can) for the wrong reason (because they will like you better, I will be well thought of, you will 'get your reward in heaven', or even 'because I can write it of against tax').\nThere are a couple of books on this subject that interested Wiccans may wish to study. Ellen Cannon Reed wrote a book called 'The Witches Qabala' which I highly recommend. It is the Qabala from a Wiccan perspective. Once you have digested that, I recommend The Tree of Life and The Middle Pillar, both by Israel Regardie and the Sea Priestess and Moon Magic both by Dion Fortune (which are works of fiction, but which Dion used as a means to get out some highly useful and fundamental information about High Magick).\nHope the above make sense.

You’ll catch your first glimpse of this in the game’s intense and much-improved art design, but that dance of light and shadows is also an apt metaphor for bleak undercurrents in the story, as well as the moral quandaries and past indiscretions that haunt the main characters. More so than its predecessor, Mass Effect 2 possesses an identity, and most of the obvious changes and improvements over the original are beholden to the shift in tone. The shooting is more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter. Rich characterizations invite you to look more closely at each crew member's personal stake in the sprawling galactic backdrop. Even the relatively predictable space opera that is the main plot has sinister moments, and you sense the characters struggling with that heavy burden.

{"text": "The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) today released the Mobility DisplayPort (MyDP) Standard, an extension of the DisplayPort connectivity standard for mobile devices.\nMyDP enables mobile devices to share high-definition video, audio, and 3D content with larger external displays through common, widely adopted connectors. MyDP allows users to experience their mobile content in full, uncompressed 1080p (HDTV).\n\"Today's mobile devices with powerful processors and mass storage capacities have become the new hub of media content,\" said Soumendra Mohanty, senior director of marketing for Analogix. \"However, consumers wish to experience their mobile content in a more diverse manner, beyond what a four-inch screen can offer. MyDP gives the industry a standard interface to break down screen size limitations, and Analogix is ready today with its compatible SlimPort products.\"\nWith the MyDP standard, high-quality audio, video, and 3D content can be shared from a mobile device to a larger external DisplayPort or HDMI equipped display, including a PC monitor, digital signage display or HDTV, using the micro-USB connector found on the majority of smartphones and tablets. By leveraging a simple passive cable, users can experience their content at 1080P full HD resolution, 24-bit color, and 60Hz. Users can also access the DVI and VGA displays, projectors and TVs through the use of MyDP adaptors and active converters. The MyDP interface also includes a 1Mbps sideband channel that provides enough bandwidth to support accessory functions including multi-touch, keyboard, mouse, and remote control of the external display. Furthermore, MyDP enables charging of the mobile device battery, through the MyDP cable, from the power provided by the DisplayPort-enabled display, while content is enjoyed.\nMyDP adoption is expected in next-generation tablets, ultrabooks, and smartphones, with the first products scheduled to ship in the fourth quarter of 2012.\nThe new link arrives at a time when Silicon Image claims its high-definition video interconnect MHL, a mobile variant of HDMI, is already enabled in 50 million devices including handsets from HTC, LG and Samsung and TVs from LG, Samsung, Sharp and Toshiba.\nMHL 1.0 supports 1080p video at 60 Hz as well as power over the link and existing connectors. Last month Silicon Image also announced MHL 2.0 supporting full 1080p video at 60 Hz at as little as 30 milliwatts.

{"text": "Instructors: Andrea Dykstra, Curt Van Dam, Kelli Ten Haken and Tami De Jong\n1. Students will gain interest in the Unit on Alaska.\n2. Students will be introduced to Alaska and the Iditarod race that takes place\nin Alaska every year.\n3. Students will be able to appreciate the beauty of Godís creation in Alaska.\n4. Students will be able to see Godís majesty and power in their personal experiences.\nIn this lesson, the students will discuss what they know about Alaska. They will watch\na movie and then discuss how God shows His power and majesty through creation. Next,\nthey will be introduced to the Iditarod race by reading a story and then the teachers will\nexplain the game the students will play about the Iditarod through the unit. At the end of\nclass, students will have a chance to start work on their maps of Alaska and then the\nteachers will end in closing prayer.\n- Psalm 19:1-\nThe Heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.\n- Other Scripture references that can be used through out the unit:\nThe Creation story in Gen. 1 and 2\nAlaska: Spirit of the Wild\n2. DVD player\n5. Learning center and trade books\n6. Example of the Iditarod Game\n7. Book: Iditarod Dream by Ted Wood\n8. Overhead projector, overhead and pen\n9. Construction paper\n10. Markers, crayons, colored pencils\n1. On the first day of this unit, teachers should enter the room dressed in parkas,\nsnowshoes, scarves, mittens; anything that looks like what people in Alaska would\nwear. Motion for the student to sit down. Once they are quiet, ask them where\nthey think the teachers are from and how they came to this conclusion. We would\nexpect conclusions such as the Artic, Antarctica, and possibly Alaska.\n2. Have students take out a sheet of paper and write five things down that come to\ntheir minds when they think of Alaska. Have them get into groups of three and\nshare what they wrote with their group. The students will be encouraged to share\nthe combined ideas from their group with the whole class. The teacher will write\ndown these ideas on the overhead.\n3. Explain to the students that they are going to be learning about all of these of\nthese things and even more about Alaska in the upcoming unit.\n4. Have each student write down one or two things about Alaska they would like\nto know more about. Suggest ideas such as: What sports do they play in Alaska?\nHow many people live there? Is it really cold and snowy year round? Take these\nideas into consideration when planning the rest of the unit.\n1. Put in the DVD Alaska: Sprit of the Wild. Students will watch the movie. It is forty\nminutes long. Before they watch it, share with them the beauty that can be found in\nAlaska. Tell them to look specifically for how they can see God in the things that are\nshown on the film.\n2. After the movie, discuss with the students what they thought of the movie. Ask them\nquestions such as what surprised you about this film? What did you learn about Alaska\nthat you didnít know before? What can we discover about God by watching this movie?\nHow can we get to know God better by studying Alaska?\n3. Read Psalm 19:1 aloud. Read it again, this time have the students say it after you. Ask\nthem how this verse relates to Alaska. Hopefully they will make the connection that\ncreation shouts Godís praise. Alaska is so beautiful; this reflects on Godís majesty,\ncreativity and mercy. God loves us enough to give us beautiful creation simply so we\ncan enjoy it. We can see his fingerprints in Alaska.\n4. Read Psalm 8 aloud. Again, ask them how this verse relates to Alaska. They will probably\nhave similar responses as above in step three. Share a personal experience of how he/\nshe has seen Godís power and majesty in His creation.\n- For example, this is my own experience; you could share something similar to it:\nOne time I climbed the highpoint of Colorado with my dad. We started hiking\nbefore the sun was up. As we were walking along the ridge of the mountain, the\nsun began to rise; the colors were brilliant! We kept on hiking and hiking. I was\ngetting tired and hungry but soon we came close to the top. As I climbed up the\nlast little peak and the top of the mountain, I looked out and the view was\nbreathtaking!!! I had never seen so many snow capped mountains before. Sitting\nup there on the mountaintop, I felt such a joy and peace. What a great God I\nserve! He created all of this; His creation alone is enough to tell of His majesty.\n5. Ask the students if any of them have had an experience like this; encourage them to\nshare if they would like.\n6. Encourage them to find other verses that could relate to our study of Alaska and bring\nthem to class tomorrow to share.\n1. Introduce the Iditarod race the studentís will be learning about by reading the book\nIditarod Dream by Ted Wood. As you are reading, stop periodically through out the\nbook and ask them to jot down a few of their thoughts. At the end of the book ask\nthem to share a few thoughts they wrote down about the book.\n2. Introduce the game the students will be playing throughout the unit. Tell the students\nthey will be having their own Iditarod race in the classroom. Each student will make a\nmap of Alaska on construction paper. On this map, they will draw the trail of the\nIditarod race. They will have to map out the different checkpoints of the race on their\ntrails. It is their job to find out how many miles are between each checkpoint and how\nmany miles they can travel in one day.\n3. Each day the students will move their markers on their maps how ever many miles we\ndecide as a class they can travel in one day. Every morning the students will receive\na ďracerís fateĒ card. These cards will say various things such as, ďyour dog has broken\na leg, move back twenty milesĒ, or ď you have found an extra bundle of food on the trail,\nmove ahead twelve milesĒ. The students will have to keep track of where they are on\nthe trail on their own maps and on a large map on the classroom bulletin board.\n4. Each afternoon, students will have an opportunity to receive another card if they got\ntheir homework done on time that day. This card could be good or bad, but the students\nget to decide if they want to take it.\n5. This activity will be incorporated into language arts. The students will be keeping a\nrace journal. As they play this game they can write their feelings about the race in the\njournal as if they were an actual racer.\n6. This game will also be incorporated into math. Students will need to do calculations to\nplay the game correctly. They will also discover how to find median, mean and\nusing the game.\n1. The students will begin making their maps of Alaska for the Iditarod game. The\noutline of the map of Alaska will be projected on the overhead so the students have\nsomething to follow when they draw. Copies of the outline of this map will be available\nfor students to trace if they do not want to draw the map freehand.\n2. The students can use crayons or colored pencils to make their maps on.\n3. The trail outline and check points will be labeled on the overhead map, but the students\nwill need to research how many miles are in between each check point in a later class\n1. Read Psalm 8 one more time and end in prayer, thanking God for His creativity that\nis evident in all of creation, especially as it has been seen in Alaska today.\n1. Students can do more research about the real Iditarod race on the Internet.\n2. Students can read one of the many books about Alaska set up in the learning center.\n3. Students can complete any activity set up in the learning center, including: math\nstory problems, language arts writing activities, and social studies and science\n1. Observe how much students participate in the lesson. Have one teacher walk\naround with a checklist and put checks by the names of the students who are\non task and participating by sharing, asking questions, diligently listening.\n2. Observe how diligently students work on their maps. Check the next day to see\nif they have completed them. Give them a check if they are finished and are done\nLesson Plans Unit Outline Home Page\nTrade Books Learning Center", "id": "<urn:uuid:d07cc3a6-5c93-4a54-aa41-e4364927c35f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://center.dordt.edu/266.543units/Alaska%20unit/intro.les.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:30:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9499552845954895, "token_count": 1899, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "2011 Predictions & Game Story\nWeek 2 - Miss State at Auburn\nSEC Fearless Predictions &\nFollow Us @CFBNews\nFacebook | E-mail Us\nSept. 10 at Auburn 41 ... Mississippi State 34\nCFN Analysis: The offense worked. The defense is going to be a work in progress all season long, especially on the defensive front, as the run defense got blown away by a spread attack running game for the second straight week. Mississippi State ran wild and was efficient against the Tiger secondary, but the Tigers relied on Michael Dyer and a good ground game, and another decent but not spectacular day from Barrett Trotter, to pull out the huge SEC win. Remember, Mississippi State is supposed to be one of the hot teams in the league this year, and the Tigers were able to do just enough to get by with the win. It might not have been pretty so far, and there are a whole slew of issues, but 2-0 is 2-0. However, the defensive front will have to be far, far stronger to get by Clemson on the road next week.\nThis is devastating for Mississippi State. This was supposed to be the announcement that the program was ready to play with the big boys, and now, with LSU coming to down in five days, the Bulldogs have to gear it back up in a hurry or be 0-2 and irrelevant in the SEC title chase. MSU outplayed the Tigers in so many ways, with Vick Ballard running for 135 yards and Chris Relf completing 20-of-33 passes for 195 yards and a touchdown and running 27 times for 106 yards, but ten penalties for 75 yards and too many defensive lapses were bigger than all the good things the team did. If MSU can beat LSU, then everything changes, but this was a winnable game that slipped away.\n(AP) AUBURN, Ala. -- Ryan Smith stopped Chris Relf at the goal line on the final play to preserve Auburn's 41-34 win over No. 16 Mississippi State on Saturday.\nRelf kept the ball on an option and headed for the end zone before Smith went low and brought the 240-pound quarterback down for the Tigers (2-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference), who had gone from defending national champions to unranked underdog after needing a furious rally to beat Utah State.\nThis time they held on against the Bulldogs (1-1, 0-1), who nearly pulled off a similar comeback to force overtime.\nThey marched 66-plus yards in the final 2:52 with only one pass. Before the game's last play, Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen raced to an official, signaling timeout, and managed to get three seconds put back on the clock.\nAll 10 remaining ticked off when Relf came up short.\nDaren Bates, Jake Holland and Neiko Thorpe had led a swarm of defenders to stop Vick Ballard for a short loss on the previous play.\nMike Dyer rushed for 150 yards and two touchdowns for the Tigers, who extended major college football's longest win streak to 17 games. This one will do more to convince poll voters that they can still be competitive in the SEC despite the loss of Cam Newton, Nick Fairley and a host of other starters.\nDyer led the players' sprint toward the student section to celebrate while the final play was under review -- and quickly upheld.\nThe Auburn defense was on the field for 97 plays and gave up 531 yards and 31 first downs before coming through when it appeared Mississippi State would at least send the game to overtime.\nRelf, Ballard and Mississippi State put a pounding on them until the end.\nBallard ran for a 3-yard touchdown with 4:51 left to keep Mississippi State alive. Ballard set it up with runs of 19, 13 and 6 yards.\nThe Bulldogs then held Auburn to three and out and got the ball back with nearly 3 minutes remaining.\nRelf passed for 195 yards and a touchdown and ran 27 times for 106 yards. Ballard ran 21 times for 106 yards to help Mississippi State play keepaway.\nBarrett Trotter was 16-of-23 passing for 146 yards and two touchdowns for the Tigers. Emory Blake accounted for most of the passing yards with 108 yards on seven catches, including a 46-yard touchdown.\nBoth quarterbacks had interceptions returned for touchdowns, but the offenses supplied most of the big plays.\nTrotter rolled right and hit tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen for a 10-yard touchdown a minute into the fourth quarter for a 41-27 lead. Dyer, who also had a 52-yard run on the drive, had taken a direct snap and converted a fourth-and-1 by a couple of inches to keep it going.\nThe Bulldogs converted a fourth down play in their own territory on their next possession but couldn't reach midfield.\nThat wasn't a problem the final two drives, or many others.\nThe Tigers took a 31-24 lead into halftime in a series that include a 3-2 Auburn win just three years ago before both programs turned to new offenses and started putting up big numbers.\nThe Tigers finished with two quick touchdowns to survive Utah State and opened with two more for a 28-point run-up in a 5:28 span.\nMississippi State (1-0) at Auburn (1-0) Sept.\n10, 12:21, SEC Network/ESPN3\nGet Tickets For This Game\nHere’s The Deal … Auburn, you were just joking around, right?\nThe Tigers should’ve lost to Utah State, and even after escaping with a miracle, it was an embarrassing performance for the defending national champion. But, of course, they managed to turn it on at the right time, they came away with the win, and if they can come up with a win in the SEC opener, then the close call against the Aggies won’t matter.\nIt doesn’t matter that Auburn is rebuilding and struggles so much to start the season; it’ll be a really, really big deal if Mississippi State can pull off the road win after coming so achingly close in last year’s 1-14 loss. The Bulldogs are hot after closing out strong and with a dominant 59-14 win over Memphis to start out the year, and over a five day span, they’ll know exactly where they stand in the SEC race, and if they can win both upcoming games, in the national title chase.\nThe Auburn game is huge, having lost the last three games in the series and nine of the last ten, but MSU is the favorite. The LSU game next Thursday night might be even bigger, but it’s one step at a time for a Bulldog program that’s just used to the idea of being a player again. Now, there are real, live, expectations, and now, they’re the hunted.\nMSU might have come up with a breakthrough 9-4 2010 campaign, but it didn’t exactly beat anyone big. Wins over Florida, Georgia, and Michigan might sound impressive, but those three powers weren’t nearly up to their normal snuff. The same goes for this year’s Auburn team, but again, it doesn’t matter. Beating the national champion and coming up with an SEC West road win is important, and no matter what happens to Auburn the rest of the way, this would be the biggest victory of the Dan Mullen era so far.\nFor Auburn, this is a chance to show that all is right with the world. Everyone has problems with the first game from time to time – it’s been quickly forgotten how Oklahoma was pushed to the wall by Utah State in last year’s opener – but this game is for more than just getting back a little respect; it could be about survival.\nIf the Utah State was really an indicator of things to come, then with a road trip to Clemson up next, a layup against Florida Atlantic follows. And then comes the fun: at South Carolina, at Arkansas, Florida, at LSU. Could a 2-6 start really be possible? That’s a stretch, but after the first 58 minutes of last week’s game against Utah State, it could be panic time.\nWhy Mississippi State Might Win: The Auburn defensive front was ripped to shreds by the Utah State offensive line. The Aggie front five was a bit of a question mark because of injuries, but the parts came back and it came up with a technically sound performance opening up ten-mile wide holes for Chuckie Keeton and a running game that tore off 227 yards and five touchdowns. Worse yet, the defense had a disastrous time getting off the field as Keeton and Utah State converted ten of 17 third down chances and held on to the ball for close to 38 minutes.\nMississippi State is better than Utah State, and Chris Relf is better than Chuckie Keeton.\nThe Bulldog offense was in midseason form against a bad Memphis defense, ripping off 309 yards and five scores with Relf running for 51 yards and connecting on 13-of-21 passes for 202 yards and two touchdowns before giving way to backup Tyler Russell. Basically, if Auburn couldn’t handle the Utah State spread, it’s not going to have a prayer of a chance against the MSU version.\nWhy Auburn Might Win: Lost in the close call against Utah State was a terrific performance from Barrett Trotter. The running game might have been a disaster, and the defensive front had problems, but the passing game worked like it was supposed to with Trotter connecting on 17-of-23 passes for 261 yards and three touchdowns, and of course, showing cool and calm leadership in the final moments. The Mississippi State pass defense was a problem last year, and while there’s experience and talent returning, the secondary has to still prove it can slow down a good passing game.\nLast year was last year, but still, the Bulldogs gave up 250 yards or more in each of the last five games, and were just okay at keeping the big plays to a minimum. The pass rush wasn’t anything special in the opener against Memphis, and it might have to sell out a little bit to get to Trotter and throw off the timing. Utah State kept the Tiger ground game in check by being disciplined and not doing anything crazy with the linebackers, and it worked, but Trotter had a big game. MSU might have to get a bit more creative and take its chances against the phenomenal Auburn running backs.\nWhat To Watch Out For: Auburn’s Michael Dyer was the BCS Championship MVP, and Onterio McCalebb was a superstar recruit and has an NFL future, but Mississippi State’s Vick Ballard is as good as any running back in this game, and in the conference. Ballard came to MSU as a good-looking JUCO transfer, tearing off 1,728 yards and 22 scores in 2009 for Mississippi Gulf Coast CC, and he was supposed to be a big part of the offense right away. It took about a month to become the main man, and then he blew for a team-leading 968 yards and a whopping 19 scores. At 5-11 and 215 pounds, he’s not necessarily a thumper, but he’s physical, extremely quick, and is the perfect fit for what Dan Mullen wants to do with his spread attack. Last week, he ran for 60 yards and two touchdowns on just seven carries, and after running five times for 13 yards and a score in last year’s loss to Auburn, he’ll be looking to make a statement.\nAuburn’s defensive front seven has to be far, far better than it was against Utah State. There might have been problems, but new starting linebacker Jonathan Evans did what he could to save the D and clean up the messes left by the interior. Evans has been a spot starter on both the strong and weak sides over his first few seasons, making 27 tackles as a key reserve, and after making 14 stops against the Aggies, he’s quickly growing into his new role. The 5-11, 225-pound native veteran has played in 26 games during his first two years and is a big hitter who should put up double-digit numbers against the Bulldogs.\nWhat Will Happen: Auburn won’t be back to being Auburn again, but it’ll be far stronger, far sharper, and far better. Utah State wasn’t necessarily a wake-up call as much as it was a chance to get everyone into their new spots, and it’s possible that the close win might be a confidence-builder. Mississippi State is good, really good, but Trotter will be excellent, the Tiger defensive front will play far better, and for the second straight year, it’s going to be a tight battle down to the wire.\nCFN Prediction: Auburn 23 … Mississippi State 20\n- Click For Latest Line From ATS:\nMississippi State -6.5 O/U: 56.5\n- Get Tickets For This Game\n- FREE EXPERT COLLEGE FOOTBALL SELECTIONS", "id": "<urn:uuid:3f153045-fcc9-4626-b600-a07d92a005e0>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cfn.scout.com/2/1094615.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9702298045158386, "token_count": 2753, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Urgent and innovative steps to jumpstart Rhode Island’s economy\nThe Goals: Make our assets work for us, establish an honest budget policy, and end cronyism and corruption.\nToday I am proposing a specific set of steps that can be implemented in the first 100 days of my administration.\nMy plan is to work with existing assets, help bring the state budget under control, and expunge the corruption and cronyism that has been a dead weight on our economy for far too long. Our priority must be to focus on ripe redevelopment opportunities at Warwick Station, the Providence Jewelry District, Quonset Point, and Newport’s North End. Clustering our economic development strategy will allow us to create a critical mass for growth. In addition, we can target major infrastructure improvements, such as super high-speed Internet connectivity, that will attract businesses just as traditional transportation systems attract business. This new infrastructure is critical in enabling Rhode Island to compete with Massachusetts and other communication hubs for high-tech industry and related high-paying jobs.\nUnemployment hit 11.8 percent in August — the worst in New England. I intend to take prompt and decisive action to reverse policies that have not created jobs, not been kind to small businesses, and have slashed funding to state colleges and universities at the very time that public investment in education and workforce development is most critical.\nI have six years of experience in the manufacturing sector, including four years building submarines at Electric Boat. I have faith that with honest leadership, wise decisions, and hard work, we can bring Rhode Island’s economy back.\nI have a vision for our state’s future, and it is in the spirit of Samuel Slater and Rhode Island’s leadership role in America’s first industrial revolution. I see modern high tech manufacturing hubs, a leader in production and innovation in the fields of health care, defense, energy, and in business tourism. Investment thrives because the state has controlled its budget, is investing in infrastructure and has instituted transparency in its decision-making. We nurture our small businesses, and see them as the key to our future prosperity. Our natural, cultural and historic resources are renowned as contributing to a very high quality of life. Our economy will be strong.\nToday I offer a new strategy as the first step to rebuild Rhode Island’s economy and create good jobs for Rhode Islanders. I will take a leadership role in planning and marketing the state’s most critical growth centers. Instead of offering huge windfalls to large out of state corporations, my administration will enact new policies to help Rhode Island’s existing small and mid-sized business grow. We will take action to simplify the business tax system and plan for a sustainable state budget. We will not shortchange higher education, the key to our economic future.\nIn my first one hundred days as Governor, I will take the following series of concrete steps:\nFirst: We will protect and expand our assets:\n1. I will take the lead in driving growth in Rhode Island. I will make the governor’s office the center for planning and marketing exciting new development opportunities in Rhode Island’s key growth centers, especially the 20 acres in Providence’s Jewelry District opened up by the relocation of I-195, the new Station District at TF Green Airport in Warwick, Quonset Point Industrial Park in North Kingstown and 30 acres abutting Naval Station Newport next to the Newport Bridge.\nI will designate one member of my senior staff to report directly to me to coordinate all activities of all the agencies relating to development in these districts.\nThe taxpayers have invested heavily in opening up these new areas for major new private construction projects, which means good jobs. As Governor I will take a leadership role in investing in infrastructure to attract quality development that will bring high tech industry that will employ Rhode Islanders and strengthen our tax base.\nThese or any other substantial economic development projects involving state resources should include an investment in developing the ultra high speed internet connectivity that can put Rhode Island in the forefront of the technological revolution.\n2. I will instruct the director of the EDC to develop a small and medium size business service plan within 30 days. We will create a library of information to allow small businesses to have access to the same information large businesses have in making business decisions. In other locations, this has doubled the number of jobs and tripled sales tax revenues in similar businesses.\n3. I will prefile legislation to make RI the most independent worker friendly state in the nation. I will ask the General Assembly to enact act on legislative initiatives dealing with independent workers in the first 100 days.\nIndependent workers make up 30% of the nation’s workforce. They are freelancers, consultants, independent contractors, temps, part-timers, contingent employees, and the self-employed. Many are recent college graduates who are just starting out in their careers, finding it difficult to find a job, and are just starting out on their own. Others are advanced in their careers and would be attracted to the opportunity to work for themselves. Most freelancers can’t access affordable insurance, are taxed more than traditional employees, and have limited access to protections such as unemployment insurance, retirement plans, and unpaid wage claims.\nI will present legislation that will make group health benefits available to independent workers, as they are in New York, and will give those workers access to Department of Labor and Training (DLT) procedures to enforce wage claims. I will also create an Independent Workforce Council within DLT to ensure that all government programs fairly address the needs of this growing segment of the workforce.\nWe will also work with community education and meet-up groups such as Providence Geeks to promote the inherent entrepreneurial spirit of Rhode Islanders.\n4. I will protect our educational resources. I will submit a budget proposal to start protecting our higher education assets. We will stop the dramatic reductions in funding to CCRI, Rhode Island College and the University of Rhode Island. The last eight years have seen a serious decline in statewide funding for public higher education.\nFunding for higher education has declined more sharply in Rhode Island than in any other state over the last three years. We need to reverse this course, and make our colleges and universities key engines in our economic development program. We need to work to exploit the creativity and new discoveries of our colleges and universities the way many other state systems have so successfully done.\nThe sad fact is that our flagship institution, the University of Rhode Island, is no longer really a state university in practice – it is in reality now properly called a state assisted university.\n5. I will develop a new Middle College Program. I will work with with the RI Board of Governors of Higher Education and the leadership of CCRI to establish a Middle College Program to create a skilled trained workforce. This program will be modeled on successful middle college programs in place in a number of other states including California, Colorado, Michigan, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.\nThis program will give many more students, especially those enrolled in career-oriented trade schools, the opportunity to attain a quality education and full employment.\nBack to Top\nSecond: We will have an open and honest budget process:\n6. I will hold a budget summit. I will hold a budget summit with all stakeholders within the transition period. We will squarely face the projected $300-$400 million deficit. We will eliminate the practice of deferring difficult and critical decisions. We will draft a “pay as you go” budget template, which helped the federal government achieve surpluses in the late 1990’s. I intend to be guided by ideas such as the RIPEC proposal for a longer view in addressing our budget issues.\n7. I will initiate a program to ensure business tax fairness. We will adopt policies to ensure that no one segment of business, large or small, is unfairly burdened by the corporate tax structure. I will mandate an annual review of the corporate tax code to ensure continuing fairness.\n8. I will conduct audits of all economic development tax deals. We need to stop the bleeding of state resources through tax credit programs that have no discernible impact.\nThe more than two dozen tax credits the EDC promotes come at a major cost to non-qualifying firms, restricts the tax base and increases compliance costs. The Rhode Island Division of Taxation recently reported that the state cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of nearly $40M business tax credits given away in 2010 and $82.2M in 2009. At the same time, a University of Massachusetts economic study asserts that such tax credits and business subsidies are less effective at spurring growth than spending on public works projects and public education. Despite this evidence, some candidates for Governor are proposing yet new job creation tax credits, which tend to benefit only those firms that would hire anyway.\nI will demand an immediate evaluation of each of these programs from the ground up. We will then eliminate the ones where there is no evident economic value.\nIn the past we have focused on large projects and major employers, often offering them extraordinarily generous deals to come to or stay in Rhode Island. Some of these deals can be so generous as to possibly negate much of the job creation value of the arrangement.\nThe EDC has not been able to even keep track the recipients of these generous deals to determine if they have, in fact, kept their bargain. As Governor, I will initiate an audit of every job development deal made in the last eight years to ensure that the business partners have kept their end of the deal. If they have not, we will use the full weight of state government to ensure that, however belatedly, they do so.\nBack to Top\nThird: We Will Root Out the Cronyism and Corruption that Hobbles Job Creation:\n9. I will issue a strong executive order on ethics on my first day of office.\nI will attack the culture of corruption and cronyism that hinders job creation starting on my first day in office. I will demand the highest standards of appropriate behavior. This executive order will designate one individual as the contact person for all state and municipal employees, as well as private citizens, to contact with concerns about unethical behavior involving state and local government.\nWe will attack the ‘soft corruption’ that is as corrosive as illegal conduct is over the long term. We will insist that every employee ask themselves two questions: Is it legal, and is it ethical? If there is any doubt, I want every employee to ask a person who knows the answer. I will tolerate nothing but the highest standard of behavior from every employee.\n10. I will utilize E-government to give Rhode Islanders a more transparent and accountable State House. We will make Rhode Island the most responsive state government in America. This will benefit everyone from people trying to start a business to those trying to navigate the division of motor vehicles. This will allow state purchasing more accessible for vendors and for those seeking to do business with the state. The transparency of the system will further reduce opportunities for the cronyism people believe permeates state government.\nOur current state website provides valuable resources but makes them difficult to find and use. We will upgrade RI.gov to ensure that citizens can take full advantage of available public services. The upgrade will include placing every possible government online.\n11. I will introduce legislation to reform and redirect the $125 million Loan Guarantee Fund. I have previously announced a comprehensive proposal to recreate an open and transparent loan guarantee fund. I want EDC to begin conducting a national search for innovative job-creating proposals, take aggressive efforts to encourage RI start-ups, partner with colleges and universities, and establish order, transparency and competitiveness to the process.\nBack to Top\nLinc Chafee is a tested leader of unquestioned integrity and a strong independent voice. As Governor, he will work hard to create new jobs, rebuild our economy, solve our chronic budget problems, end corruption, and forge a new way forward for Rhode Island.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1f248387-22cf-4b8b-9f2b-0155c48ada35>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://chafeeforgovernor.com/2010/09/the_first_one_h.php", "date": "2013-05-18T05:49:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9478108286857605, "token_count": 2465, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Humans are quite remarkable when it comes to determining sizes. We can estimate how many people it will take to complete a job. If blindfolded, we have the skills to determine whether we are in a large amphitheater or small room. We can estimate the size of an airplane by its approaching sound. But music is the ultimate deceiver, isn’t it?\nHypothetical and literal size are beautifully separated in the newly released album of music byPeter Garland (b. 1952), Waves Breaking on Rocks. The album consists of his piano work, “Waves Breaking on Rocks (Elegy for All of Us),” and his piece for tenor and chamber ensemble, “The Roque Dalton Songs.” Garland is an American composer whose works have often been considered post-minimal.\nWaves Breaking on Rocks pairs two very different compositions. The topic of deceptive “sizes” of the pieces spawns from the size of their instrumentation: “Waves Breaking on Rocks (Elegy for All of Us)” is for solo piano while “The Roque Dalton Songs” employ many musicians—but their impressions reflect the opposite. The piano work is expansive and watery, conjuring large images and panoramic landscapes. The songs for tenor travel in a narrower path—tribal in their percussion, gospel-like in their tone pairings, and purposefully targeted, they give off a small, focused vibe. Both of the pieces benefit from their aural sizes, and create an album of sounds that is attention grabbing and varied. Deceiving isn’t always a bad thing.\n“Waves Breaking on Rocks (Elegy for All of Us)” is a suite of elegies. Divided into six parts, the suite commemorates six different people that Garland has lost in his life. It is composed almost entirely of chords, and creates more of a space than a linear narration. Each section might not get stuck in your head, such as a certain sentence from a lost one might not, but the overall ambiance of that person can be surfaced with subtle things, and this piece creates those moods.\nPianist Aki Takahashi could not have performed the piece better—she keeps the serene lines of the suite flowing and consistent with the stories being told. The last piece in the suite, “Waves Breaking on Rocks 2/Autumn (Again),” shows her control and ability to avoid even slight dynamic rises that would break the tranquility of the piece.\nThe suite begins with “The White Place,” referring to the limestone formations in Abiquiu, New Mexico called Plaza Blanca, and commemorates the photographer Walter Chappell. Beautifully piercing, monumental chords set up the foundations for each phrase of the piece and are followed by smaller, controlled hills of hushed tones. The entire suite utilizes ostensibly simple chords, but when listened to they create a dreamy story that is complex in the way nature is seamlessly intricate.\nThrough each of the pieces, the chords unravel into wandering and separated lines. Significant change comes in “A House in Island Bay,” composed for poet Alan Brunton. The listener is reminded of small rocks rippling on a lake as still as glass. It progresses to the intense solidity of previous chords. The last two sections of “Waves Breaking on Rocks” are Americana in their own ways—“Sierra Madre,” composed for composer Lou Harrison, is homey and nostalgic and is the only section to use violin, and appropriate and comfortable addition. “Waves Breaking on Rocks 2/Autumn (Again)” is a still and jazz-tinged piece, and is almost impossible to listen to without stopping for a minute (or five minutes and forty six seconds) and being absorbed by it.\n“The Roque Dalton Songs,” the second collection on the album, is a collection with much more of a landing spot than “Waves Breaking on Rocks.” Though the instrumentation is larger, it is less expansive, and this isn’t a bad thing. The listener’s brain follows the music in a more direct line—if “Waves Breaking on Rocks” was a walk in a meadow, “The Roque Dalton Songs” are a hike through a specific path. Roque Dalton was a Salvadorian poet and revolutionary who was executed during El Salvador’s civil war. Five of Dalton’s poems were set to music by Garland in this piece. The poems range from free verse to dialogue to prose (“he was a really super cool guy” is probably my favorite line), and they seem very human, like Dalton can be seen scribbling the words onto paper right in front of you.\nThe chamber ensemble, Santa Fe New Music, is comprised of percussion, harp, piano, trumpet, bass clarinet, and violins. The ensemble is successful in layering the very obvious sheets of sound—the percussion, piano, and harp construct a stable foundation, the bass clarinet and trumpet create the walls, and the violins occupy the figurative room of sound. The tenor John Duykers keeps a triumphant tone throughout the entire collection, and conquers the sometimes out-of-the-blue high notes. The music keeps a dance rhythm, resolving itself at the end of each phrase, and doesn’t really break free of this except for the second piece, the smooth and sly “Como La Siempreviva,” and inside the fourth piece, “History of a Poetic.” The final piece, “Como Tú,” employs the harp in a refreshing way by retaining the previous piece’s dance like feel. However, it makes it more of a sensual one, like a dance between two people in privacy.\nA piano is one object. A chamber ensemble is many.

{"text": "Wednesday, January 30, 2013\nStarfish and Coffee\nI always liked Prince's \"Starfish and Coffee\" but only recently did I learn the full meaning behind this catchy and deceptively simple song. The song's Cynthia Rose character is based on a childhood friend of Susannah Melvoin's; Melvoin was not only a member of Prince's band Revolution but at one time she was engaged to Prince and she also reportedly inspired him to write the song \"Nothing Compares to U\" (which became a number one hit for Sinead O'Connor but never sounded better than when it was performed by Prince and Rosie Gaines). Prince and Melvoin co-wrote the \"Starfish and Coffee\" lyrics describing a girl who \"always stood at the back of the line/A smile beneath her nose.\" Cynthia Rose had a favorite number (20), she wore different-colored socks and if you asked her what she had for breakfast she would reply, \"Starfish and coffee/Maple syrup and jam/Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine/And a side order of ham.\" Most people know at least one person like Cynthia Rose, someone who proudly and unashamedly marches to the beat of a different drummer. The song lyrics encourage Cynthia Rose to be herself and not try to conform: \"Go on, Cynthia, keep singin.’\"\nPrince videos can be difficult to find on the internet due to copyright restrictions but here is Prince performing a version of \"Starfish and Coffee\" on the Muppet Show in 1997:\nSubscribe to Posts [Atom]", "id": "<urn:uuid:8838895b-5638-4384-bb2f-089bffc1c595>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://chanceandnecessity.blogspot.com/2013/01/starfish-and-coffee.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:26:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9741414785385132, "token_count": 328, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "March 19, 2008\nFor Immediate Release\nMOST FLOODPRONE BUILDINGS IN THE COUNTY TO BE TORN DOWN\nCharlotte, North Carolina – The often-flooded Cavalier Apartments will be bought by Mecklenburg County and torn down. This all but eliminates the chance of flood insurance dollars or tax money being spent to rescue people or repair damages from a future flood. Property owner Cavalier Associates, LP, and the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners have agreed to a sale price of $6,590,000. Commissioners formally approved the purchase at the Board's March 18 meeting.\nThe total cost of the project is estimated to be $9.6 million:\n- $6.6 million to purchase the buildings and land\n- $3 million for demolition and tenant relocation\nSources of funding:\n- Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Grant: $5.4 million (55% of total project cost)\n- Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Fees: $4.2 million (45% of total project cost)\nCavalier Apartments buyout facts:\n- Located at 550 Bramlet Road\n- 192 apartments on nearly 13 acres of land in the regulated floodplain\n- Northern bank of Briar Creek between Independence Boulevard and Monroe Road\n- Built in 1971 before restrictions on building in floodplains\n- Significant flood losses occurred in 1995, 1997 and 2003\n- Negotiations took more than 14 months.\nBenefits of the buyout:\n- Permanently reduce the threat of loss of life or personal property due to flooding\n- Save money on flood insurance claims and emergency response services\n- End the problem of temporarily housing more than 100 families after each flood event\nMecklenburg County will take ownership at closing, which is expected in 60 days. In compliance with the federal Uniform Relocation Act, qualifying residents of the apartments will be given a one-time payment to help with moving expenses and higher rental costs for comparable housing. Storm Water Services staff is currently holding meetings with residents to explain the process. Demolition is expected to begin in late 2008.\nAs the site is cleared, County staff will hold public meetings and planning workshops to help determine the future use of the 13 acres of open space. Possible uses of the land might include a greenway, water quality features such as wetlands and rain gardens, recreational opportunities, or a combination. The Board of County Commissioners ultimately will decide what to do with the site along Briar Creek.\nCounty Storm Water Services Division Director Dave Canaan says buying the property will save public money in the long run. \"It's cheaper for the government to get people and buildings out of harm's way than it is to issue disaster checks after repeated, severe floods,\" he says. He notes that detailed benefit/cost analysis was required as part of the grant application and approval. \"If the apartments remained, future flood damages would cost four times more than we're spending to buy and demolish them now,\" Canaan says.\nThe cost savings does not include money spent on emergency evacuations by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police and Charlotte Fire Departments, or the cost to the Red Cross and other groups who house and feed flood victims. Past rescue and emergency assistance costs associated with flooding at the Cavalier Apartments have cost several hundred thousand dollars. \"This is another win-win,\" says Canaan. \"The federal government will no longer pay flood damage claims for Cavalier, local emergency response personnel can focus on other priorities during a flood, and the community gets an additional 13 acres of land for public use.\"\nMoney for the buyouts comes from a combination of FEMA grants and local (storm water fee) funds. FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program provides grants for mitigation, which FEMA defines as \"reducing the long-term risk of loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.\" For the Cavalier acquisition, Storm Water Services received technical support from the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management.\nSince 2000, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services has purchased 160-floodprone buildings.\nBuildings acquired through this program have been torn down and the floodplain has been returned to a more natural and beneficial state.", "id": "<urn:uuid:16ff0956-d871-44eb-a23a-87c7ce5b1cc2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://charmeck.org/mecklenburg/county/MediaRoom/NewsArchives/2008Stories/Pages/080318Cavalier.aspx", "date": "2013-05-18T06:44:48Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9470648765563965, "token_count": 876, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "What are your travel must-haves? :)\nPerfect rainy day cookie recipe to pair with your favorite hot drinks. :)\nPara kay B, Ricky Lee\nThis Day Last Year\nThis day last year, it was my first day at work in Eastwood. It was exactly one year ago that I wrote a story about stolen reindeers in one city in the U.S. I remembered I found it so hilarious I had to tell all my friends.\nAlso on this day last year, I was telling my then boyfriend that I had a good first day at work and that I think the type of work is doable, at least until I leave permanently for Canada.\nBut like most things, my best laid plans took a different turn and a year later, I’m still here, working for the same company, sleeping at the same yellow room in Marikina Heights.\nI won’t say 2011 has been the most awesome year for me. There were challenging times; moments that I wished I could be someone else or somewhere else. There were also times that I felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be, that everything just fits perfectly and that I am happy.\nThere were times when I questioned my own morals and decisions, yet there were also times that I was 100% sure I was doing the right thing.\nBut if there’s one thing I’m quite positive about, 2011 has been a year filled with change.\nThis year, I ended a relationship that I’ve had for more than a year and started a new one with another. I also spent less (well, at least I spent within my means) and saved more. I started baking. I stopped baking. I changed from a person who goes all-out in nourishing friendships to someone who finally realized which friends are worth the effort and which ones are not. I also changed from someone who always tries to live away from home to someone who is always around for family.\nI guess, at some point, 2011 changed me into an adult. I know, I know – I should have been an adult years ago. Maybe it took a long time because I didn’t want to let go of the magic and ease of being young and happy and carefree. Well, I’m still young (at 25 and 7 months) and I’m still happy. I’m just less carefree. I now worry about money, bills, my senior parents’ health, my career, my personal relationships. I think this is because I now know I have to be careful, because life is short and you could lose the things/people that are important to you in an instant.\nMaybe being an adult is just having a clear knowledge of which stuff should stay in your closet, which ones to put in the basement and which items are better off given to someone else.\nOr I could be wrong and adulthood may just be a totally different story. Who knows.\n**Blog entry posted here because my Wordpress account is wonky.

Smith’s highly anticipated debut in the heart of Atlanta’s Buckhead neighborhood will combine a hip, urban eatery with classic Southern charm, offering Southern-inspired cuisine and cocktails in a welcoming, relaxed atmosphere.\n“I am very excited to bring Southern Art to the Atlanta dining scene, which has become one of the most progressive culinary cities in the country,” said Smith. “Southern Art will embrace my heritage and utilize the freshest ingredients from local farms to celebrate the South.”\nReceiving the culinary profession’s highest awards and cooking for some of the world’s most famous celebrities, Art Smith brings his culinary passion and prowess to Atlanta with Southern Art. In addition to his role as executive chef and co-owner of Table fifty-two in Chicago, Ill., Art and Soul in Washington, D.C., and LYFE Kitchen in Palo Alto, Calif., Smith served as the personal chef to Oprah Winfrey for 10 years and now coordinates and cooks for the headline-grabbing special events that she hosts worldwide. Smith’s several television appearances include Top Chef, Top Chef Masters, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Iron Chef America, The Today Show, Nightline, Fox News, Extra, BBQ Pitmasters, Dr. Oz and Oprah. A contributing editor to O, the Oprah Magazine, Smith is also the author of three award-winning cookbooks: Back to the Table, Kitchen Life: Real Food for Real Families and Back to the Family. In 2003, he founded Common Threads, a non-profit organization that teaches children about diversity and tolerance through the world's great cultures. Smith was honored by Chicago magazine as a “Chicagoan of the Year” in 2007, and later that year received the prestigious “Humanitarian of the Year” award by the James Beard Foundation.\nThe menu at Southern Art is a blend of Smith’s Southern cooking heritage, true love for Southern comfort food and strong commitment to serving traditional classics prepared with his light, modern approach. Embracing farm-to-table and regional cooking, Smith encourages diners to celebrate comfort and health. The menu will also be reflective of Smith’s own family traditions with roots deep in the South, featuring a few select custom-aged steaks from the Smith family’s 100-year-old cattle ranch located in Hamilton County on the border of south Georgia and north Florida. Read More>>>\nSample appetizers include baked oysters with crispy pork belly, Smith’s mother Addie Mae’s chicken-and-dumpling soup, Tybee Island pickled shrimp with tomato, watermelon and lime-basil dressing and a Lowcountry seafood platter. Entrée selections range from roasted whole yellowtail snapper with smashed roasted potatoes, spit-roasted half chicken with braised greens, braised Berkshire hog pork shoulder with green tomato chow-chow, fried chicken and sour cream waffles and Smith Family Ranch grilled aged ribeye steak with red eye gravy. For a complete Southern dining experience, guests can savor classic side dishes such as corn and okra pudding and sweet potato soufflé.\nArtisan Ham Bar\nFurther embracing Southern culinary traditions, Southern Art will feature an artisan ham-and-charcuterie bar to showcase the strong craft and long-standing traditions of regional country hams. Carved to order and served with piping hot biscuits or crackling skillet corn bread and house-made butter and pickles, the artisan ham bar will be a unique focal point for the dining room and a distinctive beginning to any meal.\nPies and Cakes\nIn addition, guests can peruse delectable house-made desserts from a vintage pie table from which classics such as blueberry cobbler, buttermilk chocolate cake, 12-layer red velvet cake, mockingbird cake with crushed peaches and Georgia pecans and summer peach pie will be served. Guests can order a house-made pie, baked to order, to enjoy in house or to take home for friends and family to share.\nWith seating for 74 guests, Bourbon Bar will serve as both a meeting place for after-work and post-dinner gathering in a convivial, friendly atmosphere. The Southern-inspired bar will feature a well-cultivated selection of American bourbon distillers, focusing on small-batch producers and featuring select bourbons only available at Bourbon Bar through exclusive agreements. In addition to more than 70 bourbon offerings, guests can sip on an array of cocktails which showcase distinctive twists on American classics from the pre-Prohibition era that are available only in the bar.\nIn keeping with the hallmark of Smith’s acclaimed restaurants, Southern Art will strike the balance between comfortable and sophisticated, combining a hip, urban eatery with classic Southern charm. Guests will be greeted by a vintage pie table resplendent with antique cake stands and white daisies. Opposite the main dining room, Bourbon Bar features large communal tables, a rich tobacco-colored wall covering and a bronze and linen pendant fixture. The impressive artisan ham-and-charcuterie bar lures visitors to the 92-seat main dining room which is complete with a large private dining room that seats up to 40 people. Guests are also invited to dine al fresco on the 48-seat outdoor terrace along bustling Peachtree Road in the heart of Buckhead’s business district.\nA unique collage of artwork is suspended from the ceiling and floats over guests like a cultural cloud. Each piece reflects the diverse imagery of the city itself. The juxtaposition of chair styles and patterned textiles adds personality and character to the restaurant, encouraging guests to relax and linger over Southern-inspired cuisine. Beautiful glass chandeliers are hung between the artwork, adding vibrancy to the aesthetic, while a custom damask wall paper hung above a painted wainscot creates a charming library feel.\nSouthern Art is located at 3315 Peachtree Road in Atlanta. Southern Art will serve breakfast from 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Monday through Friday and from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Saturday and Sunday.

{"text": "Cubs looking to upgrade offense\nGM Hendry seeking lefty slugger to balance out lineup\nCHICAGO -- Cubs general manager Jim Hendry heads to the Winter Meetings with a much shorter wish list than a year ago, but that doesn't mean he'll have more time to visit the Grand Ole Opry Resort in Nashville, Tenn.\nIn 2006, the Cubs were one of the most active teams in the offseason, spending $300 million in signing free agents Alfonso Soriano, Ted Lilly, Jason Marquis, Mark DeRosa and Daryle Ward. The overhaul was necessary after a 96-loss '06 season. The meetings also showed how hard Hendry works. He completed the Lilly deal while undergoing an EKG at an Orlando, Fla., hospital, and then underwent an angioplasty that night.\nHendry, who changed his eating habits and upped his exercise routine since then, is hoping the team makes headlines, not him.\nThe Cubs won the National League Central title in the first season under manager Lou Piniella, and head to Nashville for the Winter Meetings, which begin Monday, with far fewer holes to fill.\nAt the top of the list is finding a left-handed power hitter to complement the very right-handed lineup, which includes Soriano, Aramis Ramirez and Derrek Lee. There's an opening in right field following the trade of Jacque Jones to the Detroit Tigers for infielder Omar Infante.\n\"Our initial moves, as we cleared our deck a little after the season, clearly show we'll go after a quality left-handed-hitting outfielder, either in the free-agent world or through a trade,\" Hendry said. \"We'd also like to add some left-handed hitting on the bench or in a versatile role.\n\"We don't have a lot of moves, but we feel the moves we need to make are just as important as the moves we made last year,\" he added. \"We have some inventory on the 40-man roster and we'll be prepared to make a significant trade if it comes our way with the inventory. We'll grind it out every offseason like we usually do and go to camp with a better club than last season.\"\nThe Cubs took care of one of the offseason priorities on Monday, when they signed Kerry Wood to a one-year, $4.2 million contract. Wood will compete with Bob Howry and Carlos Marmol for the closer's role, vacated by Ryan Dempster's move to the rotation. Wood compiled a 3.33 ERA in 20 relief appearances in 2007 and received several multiyear offers from other teams.\n\"Chicago's home, and that's where I want to be, and that's where I call home,\" Wood said about his decision to stay. \"It was a pretty easy decision. Chicago's been great to me, and I think it's the place I want to stay and win.\"\nThe Cubs do have depth on the pitching staff with Carlos Zambrano, Lilly, Rich Hill, Marquis, Dempster, Sean Marshall, Kevin Hart and Sean Gallagher in the mix for the rotation. Hendry said he wasn't actively looking for another starter.\n\"To say how it will look for sure on the 14th of February when they hit the field [for the start of Spring Training], it might not be the same and it might be that group,\" Hendry said.\nThe Cubs finally head into a season with depth in the 'pen and some candidates for the long-relief role.\nHendry did meet with free-agent infielder Kaz Matsui before Thanksgiving, but Matsui has reportedly opted to sign with Houston. The Astros are in need of a regular second baseman with the retirement of Craig Biggio, while Matsui would've shared second with Mark DeRosa in Chicago.\n\"We've had dialogue with free agents and we've had dialogue with clubs about trading,\" Hendry said. \"Besides having interest in Matsui, we've talked to other clubs about potentially trading for some left-handed help that play other positions besides right field. We have some ideas. But to my knowledge, nothing is imminent, and we'll try to get something done before Nashville.\"\nAnother player on the Cubs' radar is Japanese outfielder Kosuke Fukudome, who has declared free agency in Japan and may move to the Major Leagues. However, he is being courted by several Japanese teams.\nBecause of the pending sale of the Tribune Co., the Cubs may not have ownership in place until mid-2008. That isn't holding Hendry back.\n\"Like last offseason, Jim and Lou and Randy [Bush, assistant general manager] have put together a good plan,\" said Tribune Co. executive Crane Kenney, who has been the liaison between the ballclub and the Tribune for five-plus seasons. \"We're going to get better quick, just like we did last year.\n\"We look forward to taking the next step from this previous season for our fans,\" Kenney said.\nWard will be back with the Cubs after the team exercised a mutual option, and Scott Eyre chose to stay, exercising his player option for 2008. The Cubs did decline club options on outfielder Cliff Floyd and pitcher Steve Trachsel.\nAmong the players who are arbitration-eligible are Neal Cotts, Mark Prior and Michael Wuertz. Prior is coming off arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. The Cubs would like to keep him, but what complicates matters is that the right-hander will be a free agent after the 2008 season.\nIf the Cubs sign him to a one-year deal for 2008, and he isn't able to pitch until August, and then he choses free agency and leaves for another team, that means the Cubs would've paid him for two months. He received $3.575 million in 2007 and didn't make one start. The Cubs have invested a lot of money in Prior, and in a perfect world, a two-year deal with incentives through 2009 would make more sense. The deadline to tender arbitration-eligible players contracts is Dec. 12.\nCarrie Muskat is a reporter for MLB.com.

{"text": "BOSTON -- The original \"dirt dog\" was back at Fenway Park on Monday, as the Red Sox honored Trot Nixon prior to their game against the Tigers as part of the organization's \"Memorable Moments Month.\"\nWhile the former right fielder had more than one unforgettable moment with the Sox, the club recognized his walk-off homer in Game 3 of the 2003 American League Division Series against Oakland to stave off elimination in a series Boston came back to win.\nNixon threw out the ceremonial first pitch as the crowd gave him a standing ovation. Nixon played 12 Major League seasons, including his first 10 in Boston.\n\"There's a lot of emotions, a lot of great things that I was able to be a part of in this ballpark,\" he said. \"The biggest one was I was spoiled by a tremendous fan base, and each time I come back up here it seems like I get more spoiled by them. A lot of memories.\"\nOf course, nothing can top the memories from the 2004 World Series, when Nixon hit .357 in a four-game sweep of the Cardinals.\n\"I think the biggest thing in winning that world championship in 2004, I had plenty of time to be around fans in this area that felt like the organization was cursed, [saying], 'We're never going to win a championship,'\" Nixon said. \"And to be able to come out of those ashes and win something was awesome.\"\nFormer Red Sox great Johnny Pesky joined Nixon on the field in a pregame ceremony.\n\"It was great to see Pesky,\" Nixon said. \"When you think of Fenway you think of Pesky's Pole and Ted Williams and all these guys.

{"text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Brazil lost all three games it played during Pool A competition in the World Baseball Classic, including the game against Cuba started by Andre Rienzo. But the White Sox Minor League prospect enjoyed the time in Japan playing for his country.\n\"It was great to be there,\" said Rienzo, who returned to White Sox camp Friday. \"I was hoping to stay more time, but it was a great experience, great teammates. I played with my friends and I'm glad to be part of it.\"\nRienzo no-hit Cuba for four innings before giving up two runs in the fifth. He allowed two runs on one hit and four walks over 4 2/3 innings, striking out two, and taking the loss. Pitching coach Don Cooper has talked about getting Rienzo back on the mound as soon as possible.\n\"Cuba and Japan are great teams,\" Rienzo said. \"I just wanted to help Brazil to win.\"\nSimulated game gets Peavy's adrenaline flowing\nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- With inclement weather blanketing the Phoenix area on Friday, the primary White Sox worry was getting Jake Peavy his scheduled work.\nRelievers could be bumped back a day, but the White Sox wanted their right-hander to throw his four innings and 60 pitches as he was scheduled to do. They chose a simulated game on the back fields at Camelback Ranch, which turned out to be a good move since the Cactus League contest against the Padres was rained out after three innings.\nPeavy got up and down as if he were starting new innings, facing Adam Dunn, Dayan Viciedo, Tyler Flowers and Carlos Sanchez, who were trying to get their work in as well. He was satisfied with what he got out of the morning workout.\n\"Today was actually a little bit better than getting out in the game because you were able to be under a controlled environment,\" Peavy said. \"So I was able to use a little more pitches than I probably would have.\n\"But I still was going about the same speed as I would have in the game. I was going pretty hard. I'm just glad we were able to get it in, get on a field, simulate a game.\"\nA little humorous by-play took place between good friends Dunn and Peavy during the simulated game, with Dunn even faking a bunt on the first pitch of his last at-bat. Dunn, who has two homers, six RBIs and 10 strikeouts lifetime against Peavy, thought he connected on one during one of his at-bats. The strong wind knocked it down in short center.\n\"No, that was not a homer today. Without the wind, that ball would have landed at deep short,\" said Peavy with a laugh. \"Obviously, you guys know how we are as friends. I wanted him out there simply because that competitive drive is in us both.\n\"We love each other, but at the same time, I wanted to get him out and he wanted to get a hit and hit a homer off me. So that competitiveness is what you need in those situations like that. That was a good way to create that.\"\nPeavy's next start comes March 13 but it will be on the Minor League side, as Peavy won't be throwing 75 pitches against American League Central rival Cleveland in the scheduled Cactus League contest. Through two trips to the mound, Peavy feels as if he's making progress.\n\"I feel good, I feel healthy. I think my stuff is coming,\" Peavy said. \"It's still not anywhere close to where it should be or is going to be, but it's coming.\n\"That was my second time on a mound. My fastball command was good. I was able to move the ball around a little bit. Yeah, I think I'm right on track to where I want to be. I hope my stuff keeps getting better.\"\nCrain feeling better, but not yet 100 percent\nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- Jesse Crain doesn't know how many pitches he threw during Thursday's bullpen session, but it covered the time frame of a normal side session.\nThe strained right adductor, which has limited Crain to one Cactus League appearance, has improved. It's just not good enough yet to get him back into game action.\n\"I just wasn't letting myself get to that point yet because I'm still not 100 percent. I'll slowly get there,\" Crain said. \"Hopefully, I'll have my next bullpen session Sunday or Monday and it will be where I don't even think about it. When I can do it without thinking about it, that's when I know I'm ready.\n\"I'm not worried. I've been able to keep my arm in shape, too. I've been able to long toss. It hasn't affected that. It's just getting off the mound. I have plenty of time.\"\nCrain's hope is to get into a Cactus League game sometime next week.\nReed getting comfortable with slider, changeup\nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- A torrential downpour canceled Friday's Padres-White Sox contest after three innings and prevented Addison Reed from working the fourth.\nIf Reed did get to make his fourth Cactus League appearance, it's a safe bet the closer would have been focused on fastball command and offspeed pitches. Those are the pitching basics Reed will work on until the last days of his baseball career.\nReed also realizes that in order to make him as effective as possible in the ninth inning during 2013, he has to have full trust in his slider and changeup. Although his fastball averaged 94.6 mph last year according to FanGraphs.com, he can't rely on that pitch to blow away the opposition like his friend and teammate Nate Jones.\n\"I mean, Nate throws 108 mph on every pitch,\" said a smiling Reed of Jones, who averaged 97.6 mph on his fastball. \"But yeah, it's good to have that second pitch, no matter how hard you throw. The more pitches I have, the better off I'm going to be and more comfortable I am and being able to throw them for strikes, it will be beneficial for me.\n\"I'm throwing my slider a bunch and feeling more and more comfortable every time I throw it. Same with the changeup. I threw it a handful of times the first few outings. Just going out there is the only thing to get me more comfortable with it.\"\nAfter converting 29 of 33 save opportunities and setting a single-season rookie franchise record with those 29 saves, Reed feels more at ease as the closer in 2013.\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" Reed said. \"I think that first year under my belt is huge. Now I'm comfortable and I kind of know what to expect. I know what it takes to stay healthy for a full season.\"\nThird to first\n• Reliever Leyson Septimo will be out of action until Monday because of arm soreness. Pitching coach Don Cooper said the plan is for the southpaw to play catch at that point.\n• Reliever Jeff Gray made the Cactus League start in place of Peavy on Friday. Gray fanned two in two innings, but the game was postponed after three frames.\n• Dewayne Wise is 5-for-9 with a double, home run and three RBIs over his last three games.", "id": "<urn:uuid:67724c12-56f3-4c27-b904-684198ccf39c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130308&content_id=42466558&notebook_id=42466690&vkey=notebook_t776&c_id=t776", "date": "2013-05-18T08:10:30Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9893633127212524, "token_count": 1550, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "As reported in Tuesday’s Maroon, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) has issued another volume of its annual report, \"The State of Free Speech on Our Nation’s Campuses.\" Of course, a new report means another grade of “red stoplight” (the lowest rung on FIRE’s idiosyncratic grading system) for the U of C and hundreds of other schools that somehow ran afoul of FIRE’s standards for protecting free speech.\nThis is the fifth such report issued by FIRE since 2006, and while it is remarkable in a number of ways—its dogged documentation of speech codes from almost 400 institutions, its willingness to cherry-pick language from those codes and present it in the least flattering context—what’s most striking is that FIRE has managed to prepare five lengthy reports on free speech in higher education while having only the flimsiest understanding of what “free speech in higher education” actually entails.\nUniversities aren’t simply another venue for people to get together and chat politely. They are meant to encourage discussion that is honest and uninhibited, and which would be impossible in many other settings. The very notion of a university presumes that some types of conversations are, if not “better” than others, then at least more productive. To have a university, you have to first accept that not all words and ideas are of equal use.\nConsistent with that idea, the U of C and many other private universities choose to regulate speech that overwhelmingly tends to stifle productive discussion. Slurs, abusive words, and other forms of intimidating speech can be distinctly counterproductive in a university setting, and so merit varying levels of intervention by administrators.\nIn FIRE’s grade book, schools get dinged for having policies which “clearly and substantially [restrict] freedom of speech” or “could be interpreted to suppress” speech protected by the First Amendment. But universities don’t exist to encourage just any of the myriad forms of speech guaranteed by the Constitution; their mission is more narrow, and oftentimes their speech codes are, accordingly, more pointed.\nThat’s not to say we feel restricted in what we say. U of C guidelines specifically say the administration will neither “attempt to shield people from ideas they may find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even offensive,” nor always “intervene to enforce social standards of civility.” And administrators have encouraged free and productive speech in ways that wouldn’t register on FIRE’s survey of university policies. In the fall of 2009, President Robert Zimmer and Provost Thomas Rosenbaum went so far as to send a campus-wide e-mail discussing the importance of an unencumbered exchange of ideas, and reminding us that open debate requires both freedom and restraint.\nThat’s the kind of balanced, nuanced thought that abounds on this campus and is largely missing in FIRE’s report. Realistically, there’s little chance that FIRE adopts a set of free-speech standards that actually pertain to the work of universities—that would be the reasonable thing to do, and being reasonable rarely gets you the attention of pundits and donors—but as far as we’re concerned, the U of C is doing what it should to protect free speech on campus, and the administrators have the green light to run all the red stoplights FIRE cares to prop up.\n—The Maroon Editorial Board consists of the Editor-in-Chief and the Viewpoints Editors.", "id": "<urn:uuid:57438ea4-3141-436c-8431-2fb5b926b3c9>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://chicagomaroon.com/2011/01/14/let-it-burn/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:18:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9429990649223328, "token_count": 738, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Young Kids May Be Able to Unbuckle Car Seats\nSurvey of Parents Finds Some Kids May Be Unbuckling While Car Is in Motion\nMay 2, 2011 -- Children as young as 1 year old can unbuckle themselves from car safety seats, a new survey of parents finds.\n\"We found that children can unbuckle from their child car safety seats by their fourth birthday, and there is an alarming 43% who do so when the car is in motion,\" says researcher Lilia Reyes, MD, a clinical fellow in pediatric emergency medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven. \"It was reported as early as 12 months.\"\nThe findings are being presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting in Denver.\nChild Car Seats: How Secure?\nWhile working in the pediatric emergency room at Yale, Reyes encountered two different mothers who had minor car accidents. They told her it happened when they turned their heads around after discovering their kids had unbuckled themselves.\nTrying to determine how frequently it happened, she and her colleagues from Yale surveyed 378 parents of young children. Among the other findings:\n- 51% or about 191 families reported that at least one of their children had unbuckled their car seats. Of these, 75% were age 3 or younger. The youngest was 12 months old.\n- Boys unbuckled more than girls; 59% of the kids who unbuckled were boys.\nParents were not asked if they were sure they had buckled correctly, Reyes tells WebMD. So there is a possibility the children weren't buckled in correctly. But parents do typically hear a click, like a seat safety belt, when the buckle latches, she says.\nThe problem, she says, is that while children may be able to physically unbuckle the seat, they are just beginning, at around age 3, to develop reasoning skills to appreciate the consequences of unbuckling.\nParents used seats of various types. They included the five-point harness, convertible seats, and booster seats, depending on their child's age and weight.\nAre Car Seats Really Buckled?\n''This study raises questions about how the child restraint was used,\" says Lorrie Walker, training manager and technical advisor for Safe Kids USA, an advocacy group.\n\"Federal motor vehicle safety standard 213 requires the buckle to release using between 9 and 14 pounds of pressure,\" she says. \"It is often challenging for an adult to unbuckle the harness.\"\nShe wonders if the buckle was not adequately locked in some cases.\n\"A buckle may give the appearance of being buckled when it has not completely latched,\" she tells WebMD.\nAmong the mistakes many parents make when placing a child in a car seat she says, is to loosely attach the harness straps or place the straps in the wrong harness slots.\nIf these mistakes occur, she says, it makes it easy for a child to climb out.\nThe finding that a child as young as age 1 could unbuckle the seat is a surprise to Jennifer Stockburger, program manager of vehicle and child safety for Consumer Reports. She reviewed the findings for WebMD but was not involved in the study.", "id": "<urn:uuid:bf010e52-2673-4816-a6a6-269d9a7121ee>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://children.webmd.com/news/20110429/young-kids-may-be-able-to-unbuckle-car-seats", "date": "2013-05-18T06:29:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9828870892524719, "token_count": 653, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Corticosteroids decrease inflammation in the lining of the intestine by suppressing the activity of the immune system. These medications are effective in treating about 80% of patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and patients will typically experience a reduction of symptoms within 1-2 weeks. Because of the potential for long term side effects, corticosteroids are usually given at full dose for a short period of time, and then the dose is gradually reduced.\nWhat are the side effects?\nMost side effects of corticosteroid use are temporary and resolve once you/your child stops taking this medication. The effects are variable from patient to patient. The most common side effects include:\n- Weight gain\n- Puffy cheeks\n- Mood disturbances\n- Sleep disturbances\nLess common side effects include acne, stretch marks, or hair growth. Rare side effects of corticosteroids include stomach ulcers, headaches, or cataracts. Because corticosteroids suppress the activity of the immune system, they can also increase the risk that patients will have complications of certain infections, especially viral infections like chicken pox or mononucleosis (mono)*. However, most patients taking corticosteroids have no problem managing routine illnesses, including colds, earache, or strep throat.\nLong-term use of corticosteroids can lead to decreased growth and bone thinning, which can cause an increased fracture risk and/or hip pain. For this reason, physicians typically prescribe them on a short term basis to get the inflammation under control quickly during times of disease flare.\nYou should never stop taking corticosteroids abruptly! Your doctor will discuss how to gradually taper your dose over many days. This gradual reduction will prevent a serious side effect known as adrenal insufficiency. Taking steroids affects the adrenal gland’s ability to produce a hormone known as cortisol which helps your body deal with physical stress. Therefore, you should tell your doctor or emergency personnel if you/your child needs surgery or is involved in an accident because you may need a stress dose of steroids.\n*You should report fever or any signs of infection to your doctor immediately.\nHow to take your medication and miscellaneous facts:\n- Corticosteroids can be given by mouth or through the vein (IV).\n- You should take this medication at the same time everyday, preferably in the morning if taken once a day.\n- You should take this medication with food to reduce GI upset. • While taking this medication, you may also need to take an antacid medication to help prevent stomach ulcers.\n- If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.\n- Check with your doctor or nurse practitioner before starting any new medications, herbs, or vitamins while taking this medication.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e87cfff0-e63d-4806-aa70-e52e5eb3ac49>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site1966/mainpageS1966P68.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:07:08Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9089412093162537, "token_count": 678, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "While Chicago competes to show the world it is worthy of hosting the 2016 Olympics, it’s also poised to show it’s a leader in sustainable health care.\nThe Chicago Green Healthcare Initiative, a new collaboration among more than a dozen area hospitals, the city’s Department of Environment, the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council and a foundation run by former President Bill Clinton, will push local hospitals to reduce their carbon footprints, embrace sustainable practices and purchase green technology.\nWhile discussions between the hospitals are preliminary, the program is expected to be the first of its kind when finalized in the fall.\nNick DeDominicis, a steering committee member of Health Care Without Harm, another organization involved in the talks, says there are “very solid commitments” among a number hospitals, including the University of Chicago Medical Center, Children’s Memorial Hospital, Rush University Medical Center, Swedish Covenant Hospital, University of Illinois Medical Center, Advocate Healthcare and Resurrection Healthcare.\nDeDominicis says the city approached his organization to put the collaboration in motion.\n“What we’re seeing is that there’s definitely an uptick in the interest hospitals have in greening their operations,” he says. Area hospitals will have the chance to share information and best practices.\n“We’re going to have a program to help them improve their green energy efficiency with how much energy they use and what type of energy they use,” DeDominicis says. “More green energy, whether it’s off the grid, or if they do analysis to build an on-site renewable generator.”\nThe city’s involvement stems from Mayor Richard M. Daley’s desire to make Chicago the country’s greenest city. DeDominicis says the city approached Health Care Without Harm to engage area hospitals.\nAs one of the largest energy consumers, the health care industry is ripe to enter into the age of sustainability. But many area hospitals already have taken steps to go green.\nJoe DeVoss, assistant vice president for transformation at Rush University Medical Center, says the hospital intends to make all its new buildings LEED certified. Rush has instituted more recycling programs, added green building materials and looks to implement energy-saving measures in its new buildings.\nAccording the U.S. Department of Energy, American hospitals spend about $5 billion a year on energy, and produce more than 30 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per square foot.\nHospitals, he says, are “energy hogs,” but the collaborative is “a great opportunity for us to share information with other institutions in the Chicago area.”\nDeVoss says Rush is hoping to get grant funding to add a “light harvesting” program in one of its new buildings. Rooms would feature sensors that gauge how much natural light is present, automatically adjust blinds and reduce the need for constant use of artificial light.\n“I think we’re at a point now that if we don’t reduce our emissions, we’re going to be in trouble,” DeVoss says.\nSeveral meetings between stakeholders already have taken place, and more are planned between now and the fall.\n“I think all the hospitals are very committed. There’s no arm-twisting,” says Jonathan Lind, vice president of operations for Swedish Covenant Hospitals, which in recent years has stepped up its recycling efforts and provides organic foods to patients.\nLind says the debate on health care reform has overtaken other important efforts by hospitals, including attempts to green their operations.\n“There are so many moving parts in health care,” he says. “But we’re here now, and I think that’s important.”\nMark Lestina, sustainability manager for the University of Chicago Medical Center, says the early discussions within the collaborative coincide with a university project to measure its greenhouse gas emissions. While patient care comes first, he says, it’s imperative to look at how hospitals impact the environment.\n“As a leader in health care, we also think it’s important to be a leader in environmental responsibility,” he says. “My thought here is this is a great idea to take a much harder look at our impact on the environment.”\nDaily News Staff Writer Alex Parker covers public health.

{"text": "Audubon Circle last night\nStopped in last night with a friend for dinner. We had two beers each, shared the excellent-as-always white bean paste with olives and toast app, and I had a bacon-cheddar burger (medium rare) for my main while my friend had the tomato bisque/grilled cheese combo. My friend, as usual, ate every bite of the soup/sandwich combo. There was tons of bacon on the burger which made me very happy but it did come out a more like medium and tasted almost medium well due to the char on the outside. They were decently busy, it still had some bit of pink to it, and this was about my first off-cooking temp experience there so I didn't send it back. Also, while still a good burger but it seemed flat/pre-formed whereas in the past I had the opinion that they used hand-formed patties. Am I wrong?\nService was excellent as always.\nTotal was like $40 pre-tip.\nPatio was hopping.\nI really like this place.\nThey definitely make the burgers by hand, but they are prepared beforehand and stored in a large plastic storage bin. The burgers are thrown on the grill and made to order. I think the burgers have been that way pretty much since it opened, but my memory not so good.\nI agree with your overall assesment. AUdobon never disapoints and is an excellent value. One think I do not like is the home made ketchup. I always ask them to bring a bottle with the burger.\nThe home made ketchup is hit or miss but I like the bit of spice to it. I like theirs much better than the anise-laden ketchup at Matt Murphy's.\nThis time, the patties just looked too thin and perfectly shaped to be hand-formed.

{"text": "Home Sous Vide equipment\nHome Sous Vide-ing received a huge write up in our local paper the other day. Apparently, there is a marketing move to get home Sous Vide equipment into the kitchen.\nI don't know about this -- I really lack counter space for not only the sous vide machine and a vacuum sealer, I also lack the motivation to cook my boiled eggs for 12 hours.\nSO...do you want one? Have one? See the need for one? Going to get one? (All for home use, of course) Are the results THAT spectacular to make this worth the effort?\nI became interested in sous vide a couple of years ago, and therefore experimented with cheaper ways of low temperature long term cooking and.... Yeah. I could do it. Sort of. The primary draw backs were that I live in an all electric house, and even though using a HUGE stock pot on a low setting on my ceramic electric cook top would hold a fairly low (but not exact) temperature, it kicked my electric bill up a notch or two I did not appreicate. So I bought an electricity sipping induction hot plate. It will cook low and slow BUT it takes about two years of experimentation to figure out the difference between 120F and 140F, and by then I'd be happier with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for dinner!\nMore thought. What about one of those thermostat thingies and a crock pot for exact temperature? Give me a break! Who needs all of that jerry-rigged clutter for two or three days while you're waiting for something to turn into dinner? Okay. If I wanted to sous vide, at this juncture in time there is only one compact, leave it on the counter top or put it on a shelf option, and that's the Souse Vide Supreme. I went for the full size model simply because I don't trust aluminum not to discolor over time. The full size is all stainless.\nWhat do I think of sous vide cooking? Well, all of the interest and recipes floating around remind me of the early days of microwaves. In many quarters, insanity reigns! Sous vide is NOT an \"only method\" way of cooking. It is a TOOL! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE sous vide eggs! Mushroom and truffle rissotto topped with a couple of sous vide eggs is my new go to comfort food. Steaks sous vide, then charred by sizzling frying pan, blow torch or charcoal are fantastic! Sous vide pot roast or brisket? Been there, done that, gave away the tee shirt. I can do MUCH better and MUCH faster with my pressure cooker or even in the oven if I want to wait a long time. I've read recipes by people who swear that sous vide custards are fantastic. hmmm... Sous vide creme anglaise maybe, but custard or flan? I doubt it. But maybe I'll give it a shot sometime. LOL! If that works, maybe I'll work my way up to sous vide Quiche Lorraine. Suuuuure I will!\nBottom line is, if you're well versed in the majority of cooking techniques, they will continue to serve you well and you can keep four hundred bucks safely tucked in your savings account. On the other hand, if you LOOOOOOOOVE a great medium rare steak... Have fun! '-)\nWell at this point I'm just trying to figure out if the overall \"sous vide thing\" should have a place in my kitchen at all ... ergo the experimentation. I \"blew the $11\" today at home depot and got the lamp dimmer switch. As you are reading this, I've got the crockpot set to WARM (@ 100% = 180/181) and the switch set to \"about 1/3 or so\". I poured water in at about 140 and will wait about an hour to see what it stabilizes at and mark it accordingly. This will cost me about 8.5 cents. We shall see ...\nWhat I'm more interested in for later tonight is waiting for my beef to finish it's marinade so that I can put the strips into the dehydrator for my very first homemade beef jerky . ..\nCool. I just picked up a crock pot (marked down by $5 at Target, so bully for me). I then rationalized getting a PID controller from Auber. Mainly b/c I can also use it for my home-built cold smoker, which generates smoke with a hot plate and pan of wood chips. I have other controllers that I could modify or program to run it, but I don't really need another project right now to build that.\nThe eggs are the thing that has vexed me. I finally looked at Lucky Peach again and told myself I had to do it.\ni have a stainless steel bowl that i use on the smallest burner (reserved for sauces) on the stove. if i fill it up 90% of the way, and set the heat to the lowest setting, it keeps the water somewhere between 130-135, precisely the temperature i want it at. no additional equipment needed at all.\nperhaps you should invest in a thermometer and give it a whirl.\nI have a Sous Vide Demi. Bought it was their site around Xmas when it was on sale for $199..\nBeen having a lot of fun with it. Use it along with my FoodSaver for vacuuming. Over at EGullet there is a wealth of information about Sous Viding. I see others have posted about using crockpots etc.., but my sous vide machine keeps the temp with .5 degrees. Cooking at lower temperatures for long periods of time can be a safety hazard. Do a lot of reading on this.\nWhat I like is that you can buy the cheaper cuts of meats and they come out extremely tender and you don't lose the flavor of the meat. Last night I cooked Turkey Drumsticks. Very flavorful.\nYou do have to brown your meats afterwards to make them look appealing.\nWe have always bought the loin pork chops from Costco and always found them tough. Sous Vide they are very tender, moist and flavorful.\nYou can cook your meat, then cool it down quickly in ice water, until completely cool ,then freeze it. When reheating you just bring your sous vide machine to the temp that you cooked it at and it will not cook further but just heat througfh. It is so nice be able to have cocktails and not have to be in the kitchen waiting to remove the meat from an oven or it will overcook.\nIt is great to be able to cook things way ahead and just reheat and they taste like that have just been cooked...not like leftovers.\nIt takes practice. I cooked a piece of lamb too long and it came out with a mushy texture that we didn't like. I write down everything I cook and that way next time a do a cook I can look to see how it came out previously and adjust, if necessary.\nIf you like to experiment I am sure you will love Sous Videing.\nHi Slanted. Interesting but not currently an option. My electric range is terrible - it will boil water on warm. And my portable butane stoves won't have quite the fine control for the extended timeframes that will be needed. I bought a 36 thermador cooktop that will be able to pull this off, but that won't get installed until we redo the kitchen this year.\nSV produces some really nice results, as well as some techniques that aren't possible with other methods. It's not exactly necessary for a home cook who's just trying to get delicious food on the table - there are always other ways. But it's nice if you're into it. I cook SV often - at least once a week for the last few years. I find it especially useful for dinner parties that are larger than my kitchen can easily manage because it allows me to shift workload towards prep. I also use it in cooking competitions, where it has some major advantages.\nThink of it as something like buying a dedicated smoker: it can get expensive; it's not strictly necessary; but it's for hobbyists and if you're into it, SV can produce some damn good eating.\nETA: eggs take an hour and 20 minutes. Unless they're ostrich eggs.\nI'm just starting to experiment a bit with sous vide. I honestly don't see a point to buying a dedicated piece of gear to do it, since I already own a 6 quart \"cook n carry' crockpot. And I also own four large 48 quart coolers.\nTo start with, I'll be playing around with the crockpot, since it already has a heating element. I can always later on get one of those sous vide kits, pre-made or self-constructed, if I really need or want to do a BIG batch of stuff using a cooler.\nSo test #1. Pork shoulder. Why? Well I have made a LOT of pulled pork, so I know what my traditional results are, using a crock pot and using an oven. This way, I have a pretty good gauge of good normal low and slow end results against my \"sous vide\" experiments.\nSeems easy enough, right? Just put boneless pieces into a ziplock bag, 3/4 fill the crockpot with warm water, toss into the crockpot on low and wait. Did it work? No - not really. My first experiment was \"edible but a failure\" vs. . The end results would have been better if the pork was simply done normally. The pork was perfectly edible and fell apart but lacked the normally interesting results that I get when I simply use the crockpot without my adaptations.\nThe problem? Even on low, the crock pot gets WAY too hot for sous vide. The water reached about 205-208. Even on WARM, it stabilized at 180-181. Again too darn hot. Ok - lesson learned.\nSo, being an engineer by trade, I've been reading ... and reading ... and there are lots of ways to adapt a crockpot to be a low-cost sous-vide platform.\nMy next step, for under $10, will be to get a dimmer switch - to limit the inbound current. Since the crockpot has very little draw - about 1.5 amps, so a dimmer that can handle 2.5 or more amps should be perfectly safe. This way, I can do some experimenting with my digital thermometer, and put some marks on the dimmer so that I can reliably set to water to 130, 140, 145, or whatever I want.\nThis is what I'll try next, and we'll see how it goes. If I get get a few really successfulsuccessful, then I can always figure out if I'll leave well enough alone or grow things using digital temperature controller or PID or immersion heater or whatever. There are a lot of ways that it can be done. And pretty much all of them are a lot less than $300 or so for a dedicated small appliance.\nWish me luck!\nBoy that sure sounds like a pretty good deal. Is that still available or was it some sort of special promotion/sale? Do you have a link to share?\nAnd thanks for the compliment but it's really not a big deal. It's really just hooking up a lamp dimmer switch to a small appliance. There isn't any splicing, cutting or tape involved at all. You're giving me way too much credit. :-)\nTo me, doing some experimentation just isn't a big deal. For a mere $10, I'll get to have a 6 quart \"starter\" system, and can figure out how cool this sous vide stuff might really be - and how it might fit into our lives. I would just rather not have one more dedicated appliance around unless it is a \"need to have\" or gets regular use.\nIf the results are really spectacular and I need to have a \"larger machine\" then a sous vide kit for my cooler would be a great way to go.\n\"My next step, for under $10, will be to get a dimmer switch - to limit the inbound current. Since the crockpot has very little draw - about 1.5 amps, so a dimmer that can handle 2.5 or more amps should be perfectly safe.\"\nFrankly, JK, you'll have an easier time just using a very large stockpot full of water on the stove and frequently spotchecking with a thermometer. I've done this for sous vide preparations of up to 24 hours. It can be surprisingly accurate. Of course, it requires a big stockpot.\nUsing a dimmer switch on a crockpot, it will take the bath forever and a day to stabilize, and you'll have to keep on checking it until it has acheived a basic form of stabilization (reliably gaining or losing x degrees in y hours). With a large stockpot, you can get a bath reasonably well stabilized in under an hour and a half, and close enough to cook with in under 20 minutes.\n>> Using a dimmer switch on a crockpot, it will take the bath forever and a day to stabilize, and you'll have to keep on checking it until it has acheived a basic form of stabilization (reliably gaining or losing x degrees in y hours).\nYou could well be right but for $10, what the heck ... :-) I got the idea from stuff like this: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-hack-a-Crockpot/step3/Yes-youre-actually-done/.\nBut instead of doing the wire cutting / splicing thing (I can do stuff like this readily enough but I'd rather not have a Frankenstein thing in my kitchen. So, these things look ok: http://www.amazon.com/Leviton-TBI03-1...\nI figure that if I start with say 4 quarts of hot tap water (it's about 120-125), that it won't be all that tough for the crockpot to get it up to 140 or whatever and then maintain it accordingly.\nAnyway, it's only $10 and will help keep me out of trouble and away from the crack house ... :-)\nI recently purchased the Sous Vide Demi (cutleryandmore had the best price, by far, free shipping) - and have been slowly easing our way into the world of sous vide.\nSo far, we have made duck breasts which came fantastic. Then we made sous vide coq au vin, which truly was as good if not better than any coq au vin I have ever had!\nThere are several features of cooking sous vide that make it worthwhile. 1. No moisture escape - the food is vacuum sealed, so it aint going anywhere...your poultry/lamb/etc is left ridiculously juicy and tender. 2. the temperature you set is what the meat is throughout. Not like on the grill or pan, where the center is perfect surrounded by rings of more \"done\" - one temperature/color throughout the piece, end to end. 3. although very possible, it is difficult to overcook...set the temp, throw your packages in the water and get to it when you are ready.\nOverall, we love it...and we are just getting started with it! Chicken breast cooked sous vide will help seal the deal. There is a reason why sous vide is an integral part of Thomas Keller's cuisine.\nAlso, I recommend the Rival vacuum sealer....works just as well as the more expensive ones. And I like the bag rolls, where I can cut to what size I prefer.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1eeb972f-f965-4882-819f-862c620dbe69>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/830562", "date": "2013-05-18T05:52:19Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9554259777069092, "token_count": 3316, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Dinner at Bar Tartine - Report [SF]\nA few weeks ago, I went to a dinner at Bar Tartine for a friend's birthday. We were a large group, so the menu was pre-planned for us, and it included a lot of the regular menu (I'm pretty sure everything we got was something that any diner could have ordered that night). I wasn't a part of the planning process, so I am not sure how much things cost for our meal (served in multiple courses, family style), but I can report on the meal itself.\nOverall, I thought the food was excellent, but some things were better than others.\nFirst course in included homemade pickles, spinach and goat cheese dip, and langos (fried potato bread). The highlight here was definitely the langos - it was like a cross between poori and fried dough, with sour cream, garlic, and scallions on top. I could have eaten an entire one of these myself.\nNext course was chicories with preserved lemon, horseradish, coriander and radish; chopped salad w/ salami, haloumi, and other ingredient; warm beet soup with smoked brisket. I remember that the chicory dish was refreshing, but the big standout in this course was the beet soup. Holy cow, this was really good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like beets that much. The smoky brisket was fall-apart tender (it was hard to distinguish the pieces of meet from pieces of meat), and the deep purple soup was creamy and rich. It seems like some beef stock was involved in the soup itself. As of right now, it's on the regular menu for $14 and it is definitely worth that price!\nThird course was chicken paprikas, nokedli, roasted cauliflower w/ seven spice and seaweed, and asparagus w/ cardoon sauce. Everything was very good, although nothing in particular stood out as much as the salads and appetizers had. The cauliflower and seaweed combo was different, and the experiment paid off. Meanwhile, for me, the chicken paprikas was a little too refined and rich. I would have preferred a more homestyle version; this was very fancy.\nDessert course was next, and for me, this was the weakest part of the meal. Cheesecake was fine, but a bit pedestrian, and chocolate dobos torte was a bit dry and plain. I liked the salted caramel that came on the plate with the chocolate torte - very salty. I would have honestly preferred to eat another order of langos for dessert. It would be cool if they could make a sweet version of the langos, maybe with some cinnamon and light dusting of sugar.\nOverall, Bar Tartine was enjoyable (this was my first time dining there for dinner, so I never tried the previous chef's dinner menu), and I'd definitely return, particularly for the langos and the beet soup!\nA few of us went over to Bar Tartine last week, one of my fave restos. And I was stunned to see how it has used the stepping stone of the Hungarian motif to create what I think is an entirely new cuisine. And it's amazing.\nTo be honest, when I sat down and took a look at the menu and failed to find my fave dishes, I was crestfallen. No buckwheat noodles. No pate with housemade pickles and dark bread. And no chicken paprika. Sheeeeesh. I was almost poised to get up and go somewhere else. Even tho I knew that whatever would come out of the kitchen would be excellent, I was having a hard time making the transition.\nBut simply put: each dish was dazzling. Just as inventive and successful as my recent dining experience at AQ, but earthier favors. And less formal an environment.\nHere's what we had (some overlap with Cynsa's meal):\n- The house-smoked goat cheese was dusted with powdered kale, and had crispy shallots, and yummy rye bread on the side.\n- Lentil croquettes with coriander yoghurt and cherry molasses: It was the plainer of the dishes, but it was most appreciated by the pescartarian in the group, aand spruced up by the delicious cherry molasses. And of course, the yoghurt was yummy.\n- I was completely overwhelmed with joy over the grilled tripe served in a paprika broth. The tripe was slightly charred, and totally flavorful. Thanks to the nice folks at the table next to ours for the commendation. Spot on.\n- Stuffed chicken with sauerkraut & king trumpet mushrooms was an excellent dish of the classic Hungarian style.\n- desserts: a lemon kamut pound cake with kefir creme, honey and bee pollen was light and delicious. and a most exotic and fabulously enjoyable Chocolate & fir tip ice cream sandwich, with black walnuts & burnt sugar.\nTho much of it sounded wierd, all of our choices, at least, were amazingly successful. While I still miss the buckwheat noodles, I am already looking forward to the next opportunity to go back and enjoy this new and dynamic exploration food combinations.\nBirthday celebration here last night:\nElderflower Cordial. Refreshing.\nSmoked onion goat cheese (dusted with powdered kale), kale chips, crispy shallots, sprouted rye bread, sliced radishes - delightful blast of smoky richness\nChicories with creamy anchovy dressing, rye crumbs and kohlrabi - wonderfully perky balance of flavors\nNokedli: farmers cheese dumplings, chard, and sweet corn kernels - jump in your mouth hot and cheesy goodness\nFisherman's Stew; collard greens, paprika broth, hen of the woods mushrooms with chunks of sturgeon - excellent spiced broth and perfectly cooked sturgeon soulfully satisfying\nCandied beet and sunflower tart with bay leaf ice cream - loved this perfectly playful not-sweet ending\n(if I had read your post earlier, I would have ordered the Langos. Now, I'll have to go back soon)\nService is well-paced, attentive, and friendly.

{"text": "CHICAGO -- Taking in their first game as owners, Mark Walter and partners watched the Dodgers get edged by the Cubs on Friday, 5-4, the team's third loss in the last four games.\nThe Chicago-based Walter, CEO Stan Kasten and partner Todd Boehly, sitting in Walter's Wrigley Field season seats near the Cubs' dugout, saw Dodgers starter Chad Billingsley fall behind early and the offense battle back late but fall short. Super-sub Jerry Hairston had his first homer, a triple and a single, half of the Dodgers' hits.\nThe game was played on a typical sunny, cloudy, foggy, humid, hot, cold and misty Chicago day, and ended with a little ninth-inning drama.\nA.J. Ellis was awarded first base with two outs and a 2-2 count when plate umpire Marty Foster ruled he was hit by a Rafael Dolis pitch. Cubs manager Dale Sveum was ejected for arguing that the pitch missed Ellis entirely. Then newest Dodger Bobby Abreu's screaming liner into the right-center-field gap was gloved by right fielder David DeJesus, who with Alfonso Soriano led the Cubs' offensive attack with three hits apiece.\n\"I hit it good, but there's nothing you can do about that,\" said Abreu. \"I thought the ball would go through the gap and we'd tie the game.\"\nAbreu's indoctrination was quick and representative of how manager Don Mattingly will use him. He took a called third strike pinch-hitting for Billingsley in the seventh, took over in left field on a double-switch and was around long enough to get a swing with the game on the line.\n\"That's tough, he shows up and all of a sudden he's in there with the game on the line,\" said Mattingly. \"He smoked the ball. At first I thought it was hit through the gap, but they must have been playing him over there.\"\nFor good reason, Sveum said.\n\"When you watch enough video, you put spray charts together for people, and the pitcher on the mound, they have their own spray charts, and they put a plan together and you play the 90 percent rule,\" he said. \"The guy's going to hit the ball there 90 percent of the time, we'll play there. And sometimes you might get beat by the 10 percent rule, but in the long run, you're going to save a lot of outs, save a lot of pitches. It's a luxury you have now because of video and spray charts and everything like that.\"\nBillingsley was in a first-inning hole after DeJesus led off with a double and was singled home from third by Starlin Castro. Bryan LaHair's groundout moved Castro to second, and he scored on a single by Soriano.\nHairston, who has done everything else this year, slugged his first home run of the season in the third inning. Hairston started at third base in place of the injured Juan Uribe and made a slick backhand play on Ian Stewart to end the third inning.\nHairston had the big game offensively even though Sveum, who coached Hairston last year in Milwaukee, deployed a defensive shift that Hairston had never seen used against him.\n\"He knows I hit the ball up the middle -- we talked about it last year,\" Hairston said. \"I started laughing the first time I saw it.\"\nDeJesus hurt Billingsley again in the fourth inning. Darwin Barney opened the inning by stealing a base on Gold Glove center fielder Matt Kemp, who didn't charge his base hit, and Barney stretched it into a double. Two outs later, with first base open, Billingsley pitched to DeJesus, and he lofted his third hit, a long triple to right-center to score Barney.\nMattingly said he considered walking DeJesus there and pitching to Tony Campana (hitting .344 coming in), but he thought the percentages were better with DeJesus (hitting .235 coming in). DeJesus got his drive into the jet stream and it just carried.\n\"We didn't make pitches to those two guys [DeJesus and Soriano], and they weren't missing them today,\" said catcher Ellis. \"Sometimes you get away with it, today we didn't.\"\nDee Gordon effectively knocked Cubs starter Paul Maholm out of the game with a lined single off the lefty's right leg with one out in the sixth inning. Maholm finished the inning and was lifted for pinch-hitter Joe Mather, who homered.\nThe Dodgers scored in the seventh when Andre Ethier led off with a bloop double, and two outs later, Hairston tripled him home. But after Ellis walked to put runners on the corners, Abreu took a called third strike from Shawn Camp.\nThe Cubs added a run in the seventh, with Soriano doubling off Todd Coffey to score a run charged to Scott Elbert. That proved to be the decisive run, as Mark Ellis walked with one out in the top of the eighth, stole second and was tripled home by Kemp, who scored on Ethier's sacrifice fly.\n\"It's been kind of that way all year,\" Mattingly said of Elbert, who had 0-2 counts twice only to allow hits both at-bats. \"Today, [LaHair] hit a good pitch. He's getting two strikes and can't put them away. For me, he's not quite as sharp with the breaking ball.\"\nAll three batters that Elbert faced reached base, one outing after he served up a walk-off home run to Jason Giambi in Colorado. Elbert has a 6.75 ERA, allowing 12 hits in 6 2/3 innings. Last year, he had a 2.43 ERA with 27 hits allowed in 33 1/3 innings.\nKen Gurnick is a reporter for MLB.com.

{"text": "Reds nearing deal with top draftee\nCincinnati closes in on inking No. 8 pick Leake\nCINCINNATI -- Talks have been ongoing with Reds first-round Draft pick Mike Leake but appear to be nearing the home stretch.Leake, a pitcher, was the eighth overall selection by Cincinnati in the 2009 First-Year Player Draft. \"We've had several discussions lately,\" Reds general manager Walt Jocketty said. \"I think we're getting closer. Hopefully, we'll get something resolved this week. We've only got 10 days.\" Last year, the Reds didn't sign their top pick, first baseman Yonder Alonso, until about 15 minutes before the deadline. \"I hope it doesn't take that long,\" Jocketty said. If Leake is signed this week, he would get almost a month of exposure in the Minor Leagues, most likely with Class A Sarasota. Any unsigned player after the deadline will automatically go back into the Draft pool, which means the Reds would receive a compensatory pick the following year in the same slot where Leake was picked. Leake, a right-handed starter from Arizona State, was 16-1 with a 1.71 ERA, 24 walks and 162 strikeouts in 19 games this season. A key member of the Sun Devils' run in the College World Series, he pitched 142 innings.\nThe deadline to sign Draft picks is 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 18.\nMark Sheldon is a reporter for MLB.com.

{"text": "Astros load up on pitchers on Draft's second day\nSecond-rounder is OU recruit; third-rounder has MLB bloodlines\nHOUSTON -- The Astros took full advantage of a Draft touted for its pitching depth on Day 2, selecting hurlers with their first four picks and 14 of their 29 picks on Tuesday.\n\"The power arms, a lot of them went off yesterday between 11 and 69,\" said assistant general manager and director of scouting Bobby Heck. \"But, luckily for us, there were some left over, and we think we got a couple of those in the first few picks.\"\nHeadlining the group of pitchers was second-round pick Adrian Houser, a right-hander from Locust Grove High School in Oklahoma, who will have to decide between signing with the Astros or playing for the University of Oklahoma.\n\"I've always been an OU fan and always wanted to play for OU,\" Houser said. \"But, then again, baseball is my life, and I want to go play pro ball, and I want to get in the Minor League system so I can learn everything as fast as I can, so I can work my way up to the Majors as fast as I can. It's just going to be a process that's going to take some time, probably. I've got a lot of thinking to do.\"\nHouser's father, Mike, who coached his son as a preteen and later in high school, said his son will be happy with either decision but thinks he is leaning a certain direction.\n\"I think if things work out the way we think they're going to, I think he'll probably be an Astro,\" Mike Houser said. \"But I don't know that for sure.\"\nAdrian Houser, who helped guide his high school team to the first 4A State Championship in school history, is in a family surrounded by baseball. His brother played college baseball. His uncle, James Knott, was drafted by the Mets in 1992 as a pitcher, and he is also distantly related to catcher Robert Davis, who played eight seasons in the Major Leagues.\nHouser said he got the impression from a few teams he could have been selected late in the first round, but the disappointment didn't last long as he was selected early in the second round with the 69th pick.\n\"Back when I was 5, I said I wanted to go pro in baseball, and everybody looked at me like I was stupid,\" Houser said. \"I just stuck with it, and here I am.\"\nThe pick continued two trends for the Astros under Heck. It marked the third straight year the Astros selected a high school pitcher in the second round after taking Tanner Bushue in 2009 and Vincent Velasquez in 2010.\nThe selection also sustained a trend of valuing athleticism. First-round pick George Springer, an outfielder from the University of Connecticut, stole 31 bases this season. Houser played football and basketball before choosing baseball.\n\"We have gotten more athletic, both in our position players, as well as the pitchers,\" Heck said Friday regarding past drafts. \"With Jordan [Lyles], a lot of the reason for his success is because of his multi-sport athleticism.\"\nHouser was one of just seven of the Astros' first 30 picks that wasn't from college or junior college. General manager Ed Wade said that trend was not by design.\n\"At the end of the day, if the ratios are skewed one way or the other, it's just a product of the talent that's in the Draft,\" Wade said.\nHouston selected 6-foot-7, 230-pound Vanderbilt right-hander Jack Armstrong with its third selection. His father, who carries the same name, pitched seven seasons in the Major Leagues.\nThe Astros used their fourth-round pick on southpaw Christopher Lee from Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla., and their fifth-round pick on right-hander Nick Tropeano from Stony Brook University in New York.\nWade said he thinks the club will be well positioned when it comes to signing players.\n\"There are some guys that, because of the fact that they don't sign early enough, they run out of time, they run out of season, and their first professional experience is in the instructional league, and that can cost them as much as a year of big league time,\" Wade said. \"Any time they can have a wood bat in their hands and play in a professional environment, it's probably going to accelerate their path to the big leagues.\"\nThe Astros selected just three players from the Lone Star State, none of whom played college ball in Texas. Wade said the club still expected to find value during Day 3 of the Draft, which begins with the 31st round.\n\"We're still going the way they're ranked on the board,\" Wade said. As we've proven with guys like Danny Meszaros, who's pitching in Triple-A right now, there are opportunities to get good prospects even in the 40s in this Draft.\"\nLive coverage of the 2011 First-Year Player Draft resumes at 11 a.m. CT Wednesday on MLB.com, where fans will receive exclusive coverage of Day 3, featuring a live pick-by-pick stream, expert commentary and Draft Tracker, a live interactive application that includes a searchable database of every Draft-eligible player.

{"text": "Q. How important was it for your pitcher to get off to a good start after he had struggled and strike out the first two guys and find his rhythm?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, I thought the first inning would be a critical inning for him, for his confidence, also just to see where he was at. Really, I mean, what a job he did. He's worked on some things, and Rags, Dave Righetti, our pitching coach, did a great job getting him back on track, and he had great poise out there with great delivery, and he stayed right on for seven innings.\nHe's done such a great job for us. I really thought he needed a break, and I thought he benefitted from it, getting some rest, both mentally and physically, and he went out there and pitched like we know he can.\nQ. How much has it helped this team to get the kind of freak plays, the ball hits the bag, you get the freak double play yesterday and then the bunt tonight? How much does that help what you're trying to do?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, I mean, that always helps, but you have to give Blanco credit. What a bunt he laid down. He couldn't put down a better bunt than what he did. He's a good bunter and we executed well with the bunt. The relay was huge. Blanco recovered, and even though he overthrew Crawford, Scutaro was right there and made a perfect throw; and Buster made a great tag there, and that does a lot for the pitcher, too, when you make a play like that. Defense can help you win games, and it's done that for us. It's all about executing, and tonight we did a great job of it.\nQ. About that play, were you surprised they sent Prince there in the second and what was your view on that play at the plate?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, it hit off the wall, so I thought he would score, to be honest, the way it carried off the wall. It took two perfect throws to get him. It was a bang‑bang play, and great call by Dan. That's not an easy call there. He was out, and good quick tag by Buster, like I said. It took a perfect relay to get it done.\nQ. The fans are obviously very pleased with the situation. How would you describe the situation your team is in right now being up 2‑0?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, that's what it is. It's the best of seven, we're up 2‑0. That's the way we have to look at it. It's the best of seven; it's great to get off to a good start. We're heading to Detroit and playing in their ballpark, and you keep pushing. That's what you do at this point.\nWe don't, believe me, take anything for granted. You go out there and you play hard every game, and tomorrow is our ‑‑ two days from now is our biggest game, and that's how we approach it.\nQ. Would you have played the situation the same way that Jim did in the seventh inning with the infield back there?\nBRUCE BOCHY: I don't go into what their strategy is or mine. I don't think about that. They're in a tough situation and don't want to give up a big inning. With that offense, we do what we think we have to do, just like Jim does. I don't even think about that.\nQ. Hunter Pence last night had some rough at‑bats; tonight he had some really good at‑bats. How important is he individually to what you guys are trying to do offensively?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, he's in the 5 hole, and those guys you're counting on to help drive in runs and do some damage, and that at‑bat to add on to the score was really, I thought, huge for us. It's a little different when you have a one or two‑run lead. He battled and barely got a piece of one pitch there, and he finally found a way to get the run in.\nPence, he's full throttle, gives you all he has out there, and that's all you can ask. You know when he's up there he's going to fight as hard as he can to do something.\nQ. After winning by five runs last night, was it back to torture tonight, back to the torture way of winning again?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, it's our style, really, and it's been like that for a few years here. You know, we play a lot of close games, and these guys are used to it. We faced a good pitcher tonight that was on top of his game. He threw the ball very well. And this game could have gone either way, with the way both guys were throwing.\nBut the torture thing is something we've had fun with, but at the same time, we wish we could do things a little bit easier. But that's not our way.\nQ. For you what's the fundamental difference in Madison's performance tonight versus the last two outings?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, I think more than anything, it was his delivery. It was a little simpler, more compact, and I think he was able to get the ball where he wanted tonight because of that. Sometimes you get out of sync, whether you're a hitter or a pitcher, and tonight he was right on with his delivery, his rhythm, and just had a good tempo out there and kept it going; great poise the whole game and just did a tremendous job. He hadn't pitched in a while, but he was right on tonight.\nQ. Can you talk about how Romo has embraced his role as the closer on this team?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, if you know him, he loves it. He loves being out there with the game on the line. That's what you love about him. He's not afraid, and he controls the baseball very well on both sides, a good slider, and he's got the ability to keep his composure out there in that ninth inning. That's always a tough inning. But he's got the makeup to be out there, and he's done a great job of whatever role I put him in, whether it's setup or closing, and he wants to do whatever he can to help. But I do think he really enjoys closing.\nQ. You mentioned Bumgarner's delivery was simpler, more compact. Could you get a little more detailed exactly what was happening?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, not really. It would take a long time. But these are things that hitters and pitchers work on. I talked about he was making too big a turn there and going side to side. He just wanted to get back to where he was when he was throwing the ball, and he just got out of sync.\nHe had, I think, three pens or whatever to work on some things, and tonight he was much more compact and kept his hand on top of the ball a little bit better.\nQ. Given how much Pence struggled last night, did you consider dropping him at all? And what was different about ‑‑ he had several good at‑bats tonight. What was he doing differently tonight than last night?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, every night is different. They made some great pitches last night. No, I didn't think about dropping him in the order. I did the one time in St. Louis, but when you're in postseason, you pretty much want to go with the guys that got you there and the order that brought you to the dance, so to speak.\nThis guy is a good hitter, and I like his presence in the lineup, where he's at, and I think it's important we stay behind our guys, and they need to know it.\nQ. You talked before about your team not taking anything for granted. Do you think the fact that you guys went through what you went through the first two rounds on the other side will help your guys sort of keep perspective of you still need two more wins in the series here?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, you have to. You have no choice. It's the best of seven. So you go out there and you play hard and you see what happens. You don't really look at where you're at. You go out there to win every game. And if you do that and do it in the right way, you'll see where you're at when it's all over. Don't get caught up in you're 2 and 0 or 0 and 2. You go out there and play hard for nine innings. These guys did a great job of it in Cincinnati and St. Louis, and that's the way we have to keep doing it here.\nQ. What impressed you about Fister's performance tonight?\nBRUCE BOCHY: Well, he gets good movement on his fastball. He's got a good breaking ball, changeup, was pitching in and out, and he was making his pitches. He was throwing the ball well coming into this game. We knew that. And he carried that into tonight's game. We had our work cut out. We couldn't do much against him, and we finally scratched and clawed and found a way to get a run off him.\nQ. That play at the plate considering last year what happened with Buster, how concerned were you about safety? Is that something that immediately passed into your mind or do things happen so fast that you don't worry about it?\nBRUCE BOCHY: You really don't think about it in the game, to be honest. We've worked on plays at the plate, and it's part of the game, and he's going to have plays at the plate. I don't try to think about it, to be honest, but he was in a good position, made a great tag. And sometimes for a catcher, though, you're caught in an awkward position depending on the throw. And you have to give Marco credit with the perfect throw to help him to be where he was and apply the tag.\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.", "id": "<urn:uuid:ac6db7ab-8615-4401-929e-f36ce08f5de5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121026&content_id=40057308&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb", "date": "2013-05-18T05:24:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9925507307052612, "token_count": 2185, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "It's all over the Internet and being forwarded by e-mail...one of those videos that you just have to see to believe. But can you really believe it?\nOn YouTube and elsewhere, the video is being called The Megawoosh. The video clip is of a man--engineer Bruno Kammerl--in a neoprene suit, zooming down a slide, soaring off a ramp and traveling an incredibly long distance before ending up splashing into a small wading pool. Is it for real?\nThe answer is NO. Actually, the video wasn't meant to be real...it was developed as a viral ad for Microsoft Germany's Office Project 2007.\nSo how was the video really done? Here's what the website newteevee.com tells us, and I quote:\nAs some bloggers guessed, it’s a case of creative compositing, meaning that the clip we get to see is based on multiple elements that were combined together to create a final video. A stuntman slides down the slide, secured by a rope. Then there’s a body flying through the air, which is animated. And finally, the big splash. \"He actually jumped from a wooden ramp into the pool,\" explains Koenigs. Of course, you don’t get to see any of this in the final clip, thanks to careful editing that makes it look like a single take.\nJudging by the fact that over a million people viewed the Megawoosh video in just the first week it was on the Internet, it looks like Microsoft accomplished their goal of getting people to watch it!\nClearing up another internet rumor, this is Cindy Swanson, CyberSnoop...reminding you to check it out BEFORE you hit that \"send\" button!\nHere's the video:", "id": "<urn:uuid:71c9e9d5-f15c-4a6f-952d-23c2eecf6214>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cindyswanslife.blogspot.com/2009/09/cindy-swanson-cybersnoop-case-of.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:59:30Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9650909304618835, "token_count": 372, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "No 498 Posted by fw, June 8, 2012\nBack on January 31, 2012 I posted a copy of my letter to the editor of the Windsor Star challenging the factual accuracy of an article by Star reporter Chris Vander Doelen. (Windsor Star misleads public over global warming).\nToday the Star published another misleading report, this one by Michael Den Tandt of Postmedia News. My letter to the editor appears next followed by Den Tandt’s story. My letter is necessarily abbreviated to comply with the Star’s 250- to 300-word limit.\nIn response to Blind faith won’t make climate science gaps go away by Michael Den Tandt, Windsor Star, page A8, June 8, 2012 –\nThe gap Michael Den Tandt speaks of is not in climate science, it is in his misunderstanding of the scientific method and in his choice of biased sources to support his flawed arguments.\n“The science isn’t settled” is a popular claim of climate change skeptics. To the extent that this statement is true it is trivial, and to the extent that it is important it is false. No science is ever “settled”; science deals in probabilities, not certainties. When the probability of something approaches 100%, then we can regard the science, colloquially, as “settled”.\nOutside of logic and mathematics, we do not live in a world of certainties. Science comes to tentative conclusions based on the balance of evidence. Just because some details are still not well understood should not cast into doubt our understanding of the big picture: humans are causing global warming.\nTurning to Den Tandt’s choice of Professors McKitrick of Guelph and Curry of Georgia, SourceWatch, a resource for citizens looking for authoritative documented sources, offers this assessment of their credibility:\n“While most of McKitrick’s work in the late 1990′s concentrated on modelling pollution abatement costs and environmental taxes, from 2000 onwards he engaged in efforts to delay action on climate change. His background is as an economist shows no apparent expertise in climate science that would equip him to hold an informed view on global warming.” (Source: http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Ross_McKitrick)\n“Curry’s contrarian-leaning ‘public outreach’ public communication is criticized by prominent climate scientists and other science-aligned climate bloggers for a propensity toward ‘inflammatory language and over-the-top accusations …with the…absence of any concrete evidence and [with] errors in matters of simple fact.’” (Source: http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Judith_Curry)\nClimate change is a serious matter. Windsorites deserve better than Den Tandt’s misinformed opinions.\nHere’s a copy of Den Tandt’s article, Blind faith won’t make climate science gaps go away, Windsor Star, page A8, June 8, 2012\nHere’s the irony about Canada’s two-decade, shambolic, inept, half-hearted and contradictory response to the incontrovertible fact that the planet’s surface climate has, over the past 150 years, warmed: It mirrors uncertainty about the predictive ability of climate science. In a way, the chaos of our response epitomizes the gaps in what we know. Our failure is, in fact, a direct consequence of those gaps.\nMore than that, the uncertain response reflects genuine confusion, among ordinary people but also among policymakers, about what Canadians can or should do about climate change. That extends into the federal Conservative caucus: Environment Minister Peter Kent has fielded questions from his colleagues, including the prime minister, about the reliability of climate science. Derided by environmentalists as an apologist for inaction, Kent within his party has played the role of activist. But he faces an uphill fight, one increasingly reflected in public opinion.\nAbacus Data late last month released a poll showing that 55 per cent of Canadians are quite worried about pollution of drinking water, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and contamination of soil by toxic waste. But only a third of those surveyed said they worry a lot about climate change. This reflects a similar trend in the United States, measured by Gallup this past April. It seems we’re really not all that concerned about climate change, after all.\nFor a politician to utter such heresy in Canada now, as former Alberta premier Ed Stelmach noted following the Alberta provincial election, is fraught with peril. Wildrose leader Danielle Smith lost to Conservative Alison Redford, Stelmach said, because she dared say the scientific debate around climate change is still active. In other words, it’s not entirely settled. In other words, reasonable people can disagree. Unthinkable.\nThis is now the most fraught economic debate we have. It underlies Ontario’s controversial Green Energy Act. It underlies NDP Leader Tom Mulcair’s strategic decision to hurl thunderbolts at the oilpatch. But what if much of what we generally assume about the discussion were off the mark or incomplete?\nThere are credible scientists who belong in neither ideological camp. They agree that global warming, certainly over the past century, is incontrovertible. But they disagree on the level of certainty we can have about its causes. And they raise troubling questions about the wisdom of policy remedies based primarily on faith.\nFor example: Dr. Ross McKitrick, a University of Guelph professor who has delved into the economics of climate change for more than a decade, says the planet’s surface temperature is indeed gradually heating up — though the rate of warming has slowed in the past 10 years. And he allows the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may eventually be proven right, in its finding that carbon dioxide emitted due to fossil fuel consumption is the cause. He also says other human activities may be a factor.\nMcKitrick disagrees profoundly with the notion that the science is settled. More to the point, even if the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is right, he is convinced that all major policy remedies proposed so far would have been ineffective, even if implemented precisely as designed.\n“There’s no way of fixing it by tinkering around the edges,” he says. “Windmills are irrelevant. We’re talking about shutting down industry and taking cars off the road.”\nThe human toll of rolling back development has yet to be carefully considered, McItrick [sic] says.\n“Think of the alleviation of suffering that comes when people get electricity, access to motor vehicles, ordinary development. To stop all that from happening, it just seems to me that would be a much heavier human toll than just learning to adapt to climate change as it comes along.”\nDr. Judith Curry, chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, agrees.\nShe posits human causes, but also other possible causes. One of her concerns is regional climate variability. “In some parts of the world, warming would be good,” she says.\nLike McKitrick, Curry contends that the cost- benefit analysis — a clear-headed comparison of the benefits of development and better infrastructure, against the benefits of lowering sea levels by perhaps two or three feet, over a century — has yet to be done. And she argues that, rather than developing big global carbon treaties that go nowhere, Western governments ought to put more resources into advancing the science of weather forecasting, to better mitigate the damage caused by hurricanes, floods, droughts and other weatherrelated [sic] disasters, especially in the Third World.\nThere’s more, but you get the point: Why is it, given that so much of the policy debate in our country now concerns what to do about climate change, that speaking about gaps in the science, which clearly do exist, is taboo?", "id": "<urn:uuid:f4dd63bf-0557-40e9-abc6-2c9a18f66d15>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://citizenactionmonitor.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/once-again-windsor-star-article-misleads-public-about-climate-change/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:55Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9454681873321533, "token_count": 1679, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean;Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Censoring Muhammad pics hurt freedom, Levant says\nTORONTO — Ezra Levant contends that an almost unanimous decision by North American media not to publish controversial Danish cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in 2006 “did more to harm our culture and liberty than 9/11 itself.”\nThe author and Sun Media newspaper columnist and TV host was speaking Dec. 4 at City Playhouse Theatre in Thornhill, at an event sponsored by Canadian Hadassah-WIZO’s Hatikvah chapter. His topic for the evening was “Political Correctness and the Rise of Islamism.”\nLevant recalled his decision as publisher of the now-defunct Western Standard, a bi-weekly publication, to publish the cartoons. “They’re news, and I’m a newspaper,” he said.\nAlthough he said he got a lot of support from Muslims and Arabs for his decision, he was the subject of an investigation by the Alberta Human Rights Commission, one of 14 such commissions in Canada.\n“Of course I was guilty,” Levant said. “I did something to cause someone else to feel some way.”\nMore recently, Levant’s Sept. 5 on-air rant on Sun News against Canada’s Roma community prompted the Toronto Roma Community Centre to launch a hate speech complaint with Toronto police that is currently under investigation.\nHe likened the reaction to his publication of the Muhammad cartoons to the movie Minority Report, which featured a department of “pre-crime.” Hatred and contempt are feelings, he said. “You are not normal if in your life you do not feel feelings… That’s part of being a grown-up, to take those feelings and transform them into something positive.\n“It’s no longer acceptable to criticize Islam,” he said. “We must tolerate offensive ideas.”\nLevant said that, rather, “the No. 1 way to fight back against radical Islam is by speaking the truth about it, by criticizing it.\n“I want to know who the antisemites are – don’t you?” he asked. “That way, you know who to like, who to vote for, and who to oppose.”\nHe believes that Holocaust denial, too, provides “what the left would call a teachable moment.\n“A hateful comment shouldn’t be something to fear… It’s a lot easier to call in the hate crime cops than to mobilize the truth about Israel, than to build a coalition with other students – Christian and Arab students. At the end of the day, not only will the country be stronger, but you will, too.”\nThe right not to be offended is not a real right. It’s a counterfeit right. It’s another way of saying ‘the power to shut someone else up.’ And that is my deepest grievance with these so-called human right commissions. They undermine our real human rights,” he said, emphasizing the word “real.”\nLevant said that “liberal human rights” can be traced to post-Holocaust Jews who pushed for “censorship” laws to prosecute John Ross Taylor, a pro-Hitler “eccentric” who “made it his life’s hobby to try to convince Canadians to be fascists.”\nLevant noted that Canada’s Jewish population, numbering less than 400,000, is now outnumbered by a Muslim population of just under one million.\n“You cannot pass a law just for your team,” Levant said. “I think it was a disaster that we eroded freedom of speech as much as we did, but it was harmless then.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:2522681c-d646-4f06-9d9f-8c70da247244>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cjnews.com/health/weizmann-institute-open-new-research-centre?q=node/98963", "date": "2013-05-18T07:23:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9632361531257629, "token_count": 801, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: December 29, 2010\nCONTACT: Paul Karr, 917-208-5155, email@example.com\nLooming Deadline to Force Hundreds of Port Truck Drivers Deeper Into Debt or Out on the Streets in the New Year\nTruck Drivers, Environmentalists, Labor Advocates United in Opposition to Ineffective, Misguided Port Authority Truck Ban\nNEW YORK – For more than a decade Kirby Reyes’ livelihood as a port truck driver has depended on his 1991 Peterbuilt truck. But under an important but deeply flawed environmental Port Authority rule, drivers like Kirby, who studies show average $28,700 a year, face unemployment or massive debt starting January 1. The new rule banning big rigs built before 1994 from port property requires these low-income truck drivers to purchase expensive low-emissions vehicles, subsidized by taxpayers, in order to keep their jobs.\n“We all want to drive clean trucks, but the Port Authority should make the shipping and trucking companies foot the bill, not individual workers like me,” said Kirby Reyes, a single-father living in the Bronx who is considered an independent driver, just as the vast majority of the nation’s 110,000 truck drivers are. “This ends my career as a port truck driver because I can’t afford a new loan for a $120,000 truck and still put food on the table for my 11-year-old daughter. What truck driver can?”\nThe truck ban is meant to reduce toxic diesel emissions from old trucks that move containers in and out of the largest port complex on the East coast. But leading environmentalists like Rev. Fletcher Harper from GreenFaith say that the Port Authority’s truck ban will fail to clean the air.\n“The only thing aggressive about this environmental measure is that it places a severe economic burden on individuals who earn $10 an hour, rather than the giant shipping companies like Target and Wal-Mart and the trucking outfits that profit from goods movement. The Port Authority program is a disaster of a policy because it ignores the pernicious business model that wrongly forces a low-wage contract workforce to own and operate the fleet. These sophisticated technology trucks don’t maintain themselves. It’s as immoral as it is unsustainable.”\nLabor advocates who have long asserted port drivers are “independent” in name only agree.\n“U.S. ports have earned the notorious reputation as ‘the place where old trucks go to die,’” says Fred Potter, head of the Port Division at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. “Not because truck drivers in this critical American industry want to drive dirty trucks, but because lax regulation, little oversight, and lousy enforcement force them to drive dirty trucks.”\nGreenFaith has joined with the New Jersey Environmental Federation and the Teamsters, and an unprecedented nationwide alliance of 150 public health, civil rights, labor, community, business and faith-based organizations are actively advocating for clean truck programs that require trucking companies to directly employ their drivers as the logical means to shift financial and legal accountability for clean truck replacement and maintenance onto companies with the capital to afford it, a model advanced by the nation’s largest port. The Los Angeles Clean Truck Program put more than 8,500 clean trucks into service, reduced diesel emissions by more than 80 percent, and cleared the way for job-creating infrastructure projects that had been blocked for years, despite numerous industry efforts to gut the green-growth policy in court. A Federal judge has upheld the Port of Los Angeles program in its entirety.\nThe Port Authority has another reason to emulate Los Angeles’ EPA-award winning program: A recent report by National Employment Law Project and Change to Win found that the vast majority of truck drivers at the largest ports are illegally misclassified as independent contractors, which saves employers up to 30 percent in payroll costs, undercuts businesses who pay taxes, and puts workers in precarious circumstances where they don’t qualify for unemployment protection, workers’ compensation or even social security.\nThe Obama Administration has made it a priority to crack down on this growing illegal employer tactic across industries, but there are even greater consequences in port trucking.\n“Coast to coast, the industry forces the cost of truck operation and maintenance onto the workers behind the wheel, and as a result, old, diesel-spewing rigs fill U.S. transportation corridors because that’s all these low-wage earners can afford,” said Carl Pope, Chairman of the Sierra Club in a recent report on misclassification in the port trucking industry. “Dire economic conditions led to the environmental crisis in the first place – we strongly suspect the culprit is not misbehavior by a few companies, but rampant misclassification in port trucking on the whole.”\n“If the trucking company I work for gave me a W-2 like other workers then I wouldn’t be in the position I’m in now,” said Kirby Reyes, who after ten years on the job will be ineligible for unemployment benefits because he is treated as a contractor. “I can’t understand why the Port Authority is punishing drivers like me, when they should be going after the industry that is polluting the air and breaking the law.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:fe3d3d7c-29ea-449b-95d0-6950ed6b5b0e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cleanandsafeports.org/resources-for-the-media/press-releases/looming-deadline-to-force-hundreds-of-port-truck-drivers-deeper-into-debt-or-out-on-the-streets-in-the-new-year/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:30:01Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9417223930358887, "token_count": 1112, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

But in their first day of practice, the freshmen did what was expected - make mistakes.\n\"It looked like opening day.

{"text": "Miller et al (GRL 2012) url has attracted much recent attention for its argument that volcanism can account for the MWP-LIA transition. In my opinion, it is important for another reason, a reason not mentioned and apparently not noticed by the authors themselves. It offers a highly plausible re-interpretation of Arctic varve series, an interpretation that, in effect, stands the temperature interpretation of the important Big Round Lake, Baffin Island varve series on its head. Arctic varve series, including Big Round Lake, have become a mainstay of temperature reconstructions used in AR5 (FOD) and likely to be used in AR5 (e.g. Kaufman et al 2009) and Miller’s interpretation of varve data impacts multiple “new” AR5 studies. CA readers are familiar with climate scientists having trouble with the orientation of varve data e.g. the use of Tiljander’s varve data in Mann et al 2008-2009 (the latter frequently cited in AR5).\nOver the past few years, Miller and associates have radiocarbon dated mosses at 90 sites revealed by receding Baffin Island glaciers, observing a concentration of kill dates in the late 13th century and again in the early 15th century. This is interesting and useful new data that is helpful to disentangling the climate history of the area. They interpret the lack of kill dates in the MWP (from ~950-1250) as due to relative warmth, resulting in recession and/or absence of the small Baffin Island glaciers:\nHere we present precisely dated records of ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland showing that LIA summer cold and ice growth began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a substantial intensification 1430–1455 AD.\nThey interpreted the lack of kill dates from 1450 to the late 20th century as due to continuous ice cover until recent glacier recession. See their Figure 2C, excerpted in the top panel below:\nFrom Miller et al 2012 Figure 2C-D. (c) Ice cap expansion dates based on a composite of 94 Arctic Canada calibrated 14C PDFs. (d) 30-year running mean varve thickness in Hvítárvatn sediment core HVT03-2 [Larsen et al., 2011].\nTheir Figure 2D (the bottom panel of the above graphic) is a smoothed version of varve thicknesses from Hvítárvatn, a proglacial lake in Iceland. Juxtaposing the information from kill dates with varve information, Miller et al concluded that the narrow varves from 950-1250 corresponded to glacier absence (or recession), indicating relative warmth, while the wider varves in the Little Ice Age showed the existence of active glaciers, indicating relative cold. Miller et al:\nBaffin Island kill dates define abrupt and sustained summer cooling in the late 13th Century, which is matched by the start of a centennial trend of increasing Hvítárvatn varve thickness (Figure 2d), consistent with our predictions. A second abrupt increase in varve thickness in the 15th Century, and continuously thick varves through the following century, is consistent with persistent ice-cap expansion in the Canadian record at the same time. Hvítárvatn varves attain their maximum LIA thickness in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, decreasing again in the late 20th Century as Langjökull receded.\nThe picture, thus far, is consistent with the “traditional” perspective on the MWP and LIA – unsurprising since Baffin Island and Iceland are within the heart of the region conceded even by opponents. Miller et al argue (passim) that modern warmth is greater than medieval warmth. However, while the authors undoubtedly believe this, this point is made more as a genuflection than as a central focus of the article.\nVarves of Baffin Island\nHowever, this picture differs sharply from recent temperature reconstructions using Baffin Island varve data. For example, Thomas and Briner 2009, writing about the Big Round Lake (Baffin Island) varve series, reported that the period 1400-1575, rather than being a period of intensified cold with a “final pulse of ice-cap growth (as Miller et al concluded), had stated that it was relatively warm:\nThe warmest pre-twentieth century period in this 1000 year record, 1375–1575 AD,\nTheir temperature reconstruction, rather than interpreting narrow 11th century varves as evidence of warmth (as Miller et al 2012 did), concluded that the 11th century was exceptionally cold (despite the historical traditions.) This temperature reconstruction has been widely used in recent multiproxy reconstructions.\nIn the figure below, I’ve plotted the Big Round varve series on the same scale as the Hvitarvatn varve series, showing some important similarities.\nFor example, both the Big Round varve series and Hvitarvatn varve series show relatively thick varves in the 1400s and 1500s, with a local minimum in the late 1600s, then strong increases through the 18th, 19th and 20th century, perhaps tailing off a little towards the end. Despite this seeming similarity, opposite conclusions about the temperature implications were drawn by authors of the two series.\nThomas and Briner 2009 had interpreted the varve thickness increase at Big Round Lake in the 15th century as evidence of warmth, whereas Miller et al 2012 had interpreted a seemingly similar increase at Hvitarvatn as evidence of increasing cold.\nIn the 11th century (critical for medieval-modern comparisons), Miller et al 2012 interpreted narrow Hvitarvatn varves as evidence of glacier recession and/or absence i.e. local warmth, whereas the Thomas and Briner reconstruction (applying a postulated linear relationship between varve thickness and temperature) deduced that the MWP was very cold in Baffin Island. (This conclusion was not articulated or discussed in Thomas and Briner but is inherent in their reconstruction.)\nVarve series from Baffin Island (Big Round, Donard, Soper) have been used in recent temperature reconstructions (Mann et al 2008, Kaufman et al 2009, Kinnard et al 2011, Ljungqvist 2009, 2010, Ljungqvist et al 2011 (CPD), Christensen and Ljungqvist 2011 (J Clim; CPD).\nPolissar et al 2006\nAnother example of using proglacial sediments to interpret glacier recession/advance is Polissar (Bradley) et al 2006, which studied sediments in a proglacial lake in the Venezuelan Andes (prior CA discussion here). Polissar et al Figure 2A,B shows increased magnetic susceptibility (more iron minerals) during periods of glacier activity (see below):\nFigure 2. Excerpt from Polissar et al 2006 Figure 2: Glacial advances, indicated by increases of sediment MS in L. Mucubajı´ (A) (vertical gray shading), coincide with an increase in precipitation, shown by higher MS in L. Blanca (B).\nPolissar concluded that local glaciers in the Venezuelan Andes had been absent in the MWP, but had reformed in the Little Ice Age (hence the different character of the sediments) prior to receding with increased warmth in the 20th century.\nIn this example, there was increased glacier activity in the Little Ice Age, resulting in more iron minerals in the sediments, a phenomenon seemingly analgous to Miller et al’s attribution of increased varve thickness in the LIA to increased glacier activity.\nThe recent articles on varves underpinning the AR5 citations (e.g. Kaufman et al 2009 and its underlying studies such as Thomas and Briner 2009) attempt to interpret varves solely in terms of temperature. Most of the articles show positive correlations between late 20th century and varve thickness. Narrow varves (of MWP type) are not observed in the calibration period. This requires extrapolation of a relationship established over thick varves to the perhaps different circumstances of thin varves – a rather adventurous extrapolation of the sort that is typically discouraged in statistical literature.\nThere is considerable older literature on varves, principally in connection with LGM deglaciation. There is a prominent varve outcrop (see Tufts varve webpage here) about half a mile from my house. (The varves were re-exposed last year during straightening of Pottery Road). In the older literature on the LGM e.g. Agterberg and Banerjee 1969, varve thickness was held to depend on proximity to the ice front:\nBoth the silt (summer) and the clay (winter) layers in a varve couplet show an approximately exponential decrease in thickness away from the icefront. This trend is more conspicuous in the sill\nWhen the Laurentide ice sheet had sufficiently receded, so did the varve series. When Miller et al 2012 attribute the narrow 11th century varves to glacier recession/absence, it seems to me that they are observing more or less the same phenomenon, though on a much diminished scale.\nThus, as Miller et al 2012 imply, thin varves could result from either glacier recession/absence (cumulative warmth in the 11th century) or relative cold (in the late 17th century) – confounding efforts to reconstruct past temperatures using a linear relationship to varve thickness.\nEfforts to reconstruct past temperature using simplistic linear relationships to varve thicknesses (as in the studies applied in Kaufman et al 2009) had already struck me as problematic though, prior to Miller et al 2012, the precise problem had not been diagnosed. In my opinion, Miller et al 2012 provides substantial support for rejecting the interpretation of narrow 11th century varves as evidence of medieval cold (the Big Round temperature reconstruction) and requires analysis of the effect of this (and similar data) on downstream multiproxy reconstructions.\nPostscript: I’ve managed to write this post without referring to Kortajarvi sediments other than once in passing. Mia Tiljander had interpreted narrow varves as evidence of medieval warmth and wide varves as evidence of the LIA. The data was used in opposite orientations in the corrigendum to Kaufman et al 2009 and in Mann et al 2008-2009, with Raymond Bradley ironically being a coauthor of both studies. In Mann’s recent book, he argued, in effect, that it doesn’t matter whether the Tiljander data is used upside down or not in Mann et al 2008 and 2009. I disagree, but, regardless of its orientation “matters” in the Mann et al articles, it seems reasonable to expect scientists in the field to develop consistent scientific interpretations of narrow 11th century varves.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0adf4edb-eb25-4e51-9621-f33a9467a666>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://climateaudit.org/2012/02/11/gifford-miller-vs-ar5-reconstructions/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=fe7f791e1e", "date": "2013-05-18T06:53:42Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.922455906867981, "token_count": 2278, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

American Media: Nothing to see here, move along.\nMay 12, 2011\nYou know that water you were told was covering up and cooling fuel in the damaged reactors? Turns out, not so much.\nThe first team of human observers entered Fukushima Unit 1, to find that company reassurances that fuel rods were covered with water were erroneous. In fact, water levels have been up to 16 feet lower than needed to cover the fuel, water has been draining out of the vessel, the fuel has been uncovered, and may have melted through the containment structures.\nCoolant is escaping through a newly discovered opening in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant’s No. 1 reactor pressure vessel, a development that could slow efforts to prevent potential further radiation releases from the Japanese facility, Reuters reported on Thursday (see GSN, May 11).\nPlant operator Tokyo Electric Power learned the container held less water than previously believed following repairs to monitoring equipment this week; the tank’s fluid quantity was roughly 16 feet short of the depth required to fully submerge atomic fuel if the material had remained in its intended position. The six-reactor site was severely damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that left more than 20,000 people dead or missing in Japan.\n“There must be a large leak,” Tokyo Electric Power official Junichi Matsumoto said to reporters on Thursday. “The fuel pellets likely melted and fell, and in the process may have damaged … the pressure vessel itself and created a hole,” he said.\nThousands of tons of water, now highly radioactive, has unexpectedly rushed out to parts unknown, according to the company – and the same thing may have been happening in units 2 and 3.\nThe reactor has received just under 10,400 metric tons of water to date, and the destination of the escaping fluid was uncertain, he said, adding powerful radioactivity complicated a possible direct inspection of the area by plant personnel (Yuto Kubota, Reuters, May 12). Much of the fluid could have moved to the reactor’s outer containment vessel, Kyodo News reported (Kyodo News I/Mainichi Daily News, May 12).\nSimilar ruptures might have developed in the plant’s No. 2 and No. 3 reactors if their nuclear material had heated to the point of losing its structure, Reuters quoted Matsumoto as saying.

{"text": "Tornadoes are the most intense storms on the planet, and they’re never discussed without at least some mention of the term wind shear. Many of us sitting at home, though, have no idea what wind shear is, or if we do, how it affects tornado production.\nWhat is Wind Shear\nWind shear, although it might sound complex, is a simple concept. Wind shear is merely the change in wind with height, in terms of wind direction and speed. I think that we all understand that the wind is generally stronger in the atmosphere over our heads than it is here on the ground, and if we think of the atmosphere in terms of the three dimensions that it has, it should not be surprising that the wind above us might also be blowing from a different direction than the wind at the ground. When that happens–the wind speed and direction vary with height–wind shear is occurring.\nWind Shear and Supercell Thunderstorms\nThis wind shear is an important part of the process in the development of a supercell thunderstorm, from which the vast majority of strong tornadoes form.\nAll thunderstorms are produced by a powerful updraft–a surge of air that rises from the ground into the upper levels of the atmosphere, and when this updraft forms in an area where wind shear is present, the updraft is influence by this speed and different direction of the wind above, pushing the column of air in the updraft into a more vertical alignment.\nRain’s Influence on Tornado Production\nNeedless to say, thunderstorms typically produce very heavy rain, and rain-cooled air is much heavier than the warm air of the updraft, so the rain-cooled air, produces a compensating downdraft (what comes up, must come down). This downdraft pushes the part of the rotating air that was forced in its direction by the stronger wind aloft downward, and the result is a horizontal column of rotating air.\nThat’s Not a Tornado!\nI know what you’re thinking that you’ve seen enough TLC or Discovery Channel shows to know that a horizontal column of air is NOT a tornado; you need a vertical column of air.\nThis Can Be a Tornado\nYou’re right, but remember the updraft that is driving the thunderstorm is still working, and it’s able to pull the horizontal, spinning column of air into the thunderstorm, resulting in a vertical column of spinning air.\n(NOAA image showing vertical column of air in a supercell thunderstorm)\nThe result is a rotating thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado, and it would not be possible without wind shear.\n(NOAA image showing tornado formation in supercell thunderstorm)", "id": "<urn:uuid:7400301c-e625-46d5-be90-1020cf8d52f8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cloudyandcool.com/2009/05/05/wind-shear-and-tornadoes/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9167638421058655, "token_count": 573, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Noise"]}

{"text": "Reversal of fortune\nTo unlock the vast, untapped potential of the world’s drylands, we must learn from the people who live in them, says Dr Jonathan Davies.\nDrylands are a major global biome, home to a great diversity of species and some of our most treasured natural heritage. They are also home to over 2 billion people and in the developing world in particular they are associated with poverty and social inequity. Global development and environment goals are not being met in the drylands: by 2015 many dryland regions are set to fail to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, whilst progress towards the goals and objectives of the UN environmental conventions (the Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on Biological Diversity in particular) is generally poor.\nRecent experiences in the drylands of emerging countries, such as China and India, illustrate that economic development in drylands can outpace that in areas that are usually considered “high potential”. Although development is often associated with degradation, experiences in Sub Saharan Africa illustrate that economic development can be greatly enhanced through protection of biodiversity as a source of income. By taking an even broader, global view of drylands and examining industrialised dryland countries, it becomes clear that for every seemingly-insurmountable challenge we are able to find evidence of a viable solution somewhere in the world.\nTo address the challenges of the drylands, we need to understand their unique features and how these have to be managed. Perhaps the most important of these is climate unpredictability: the amount of precipitation varies enormously between areas, between seasons and between years. The sheer magnitude of this uncertainty is hard to grasp, but in many drylands the normal range of rainfall, drought-years aside, can be plus or minus 50% of the average. Yet development in many water-deficit areas continues to favour agricultural practices that expose farmers to huge risks whilst simultaneously degrading the natural resource base on which they depend.\nClimate change is a cause for concern in dryland areas, but also an opportunity for new approaches and new learning that illustrate the value of dryland areas. Dryland ecosystems and people are highly adaptable and can survive in their uncertain climate.. Whether drylands become wetter or drier as a result of climate change, they will almost invariably become more unpredictable and their adaptive capacity will be vital to their future. Drylands more than any other ecosystem have the capacity to deal with that unpredictability and we have a great deal to learn from them.\nContrary to popular perception, drylands are not necessarily poverty traps. Dryland ecosystems and their goods and services already contribute significantly to national and international economies. The vibrant tourism sector in Eastern and Southern Africa relies heavily on the biodiversity of drylands. Globally-important dryland commodities include grain, meat and milk and dryland goods like Gum Arabic, Henna, Aloe, and Frankincense. Recent years have seen the commercial development of natural medicines from drylands, and untold numbers of medicinal plants remain un-researched, known only to the dryland inhabitants who have used and conserved them for centuries.\nLocal knowledge of the drylands is rich and is a powerful resource to be harnessed. There has been a tendency to dismiss this knowledge, because local dryland practices have been portrayed as backward or inappropriate and in need of replacing. The current emergency in the Horn of Africa graphically illustrates the outcome of this attitude: populations are exposed to insupportable risk as a result of losing their traditional strategies and being pushed into new ways of life that simply don’t work. Where people are driven towards catastrophe it is almost guaranteed that the environment will face similar consequences. Customs and cultures that are intimately connected to biodiversity become contorted into a system of pure survival where respect for the environment becomes an unaffordable luxury.\nThe scientific explanation of the rationale behind traditional strategies has been known for long enough to develop innovative new approaches to sustainable drylands management. Development support has to enable management of the extreme climatic uncertainty of drylands and needs to be built on understanding of the drivers of continuous change in dryland ecosystems. These are dynamic ecosystems in which adaptation and flexibility are pre-requisites for survival. We need to learn from past failures and successes and ensure that development and humanitarian interventions recognize dryland characteristics and build on local knowledge and capacity to turn the existing opportunities into equitable and sustainable wealth creation. In particular we need to generate greater awareness of the tremendous opportunities for strengthening biodiversity-based livelihoods to diversify dryland economies and strengthen resilience.\nIUCN’s vision 2020 emphasizes the need to strengthen the Union’s work on conserving the diversity of life while also connecting nature conservation to wider societal objectives such as security and poverty reduction. This vision cannot be reached if we fail to understand and address the unique challenges of the drylands. IUCN, with its great diversity of members and commission members, has a vital role to play in securing effective global action to address dryland issues and in enabling dryland communities to develop their nature-based solutions to risk management and sustainable development.\nDr Jonathan Davies is Coordinator of IUCN’s Global Drylands Initiative.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f420729b-433d-4fa6-8cfe-c81ae093a2da>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cms.iucn.org/knowledge/focus/previous_focus_topics/saving_our_drylands/opinion/?8350/Reversal-of-fortune&add_comment", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:57Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9456223845481873, "token_count": 1052, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "IUCN, NGOs, fishery managers and tuna industry groups plot way forward for sustainable tuna\n20 May 2008 | News story\nThe report from the Tuna Roundtable co-hosted by IUCN in Brussels in April 2008 calls for greater collaboration between different interest groups and industry players to move towards adoption of legally-binding measures to fish tuna sustainably, a common set of standard to assess industry performance and harmonised certification programmes for marine capture fisheries.\nThe Sustainable Tuna Roundtable brought key industry interests together to reach agreement on how to employ market-driven incentives to contribute to producing sustainable tuna fisheries. Participants were from the tuna fishing industry, retail/foodservice industries, buyers, distributors, processors, and intergovernmental organizations, including regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) and other regional fishery bodies.\nEnvironmental non-governmental organizations, and to a degree, consumers, are increasingly demanding that seafood (both from marine capture fisheries and aquaculture) sold by retailers and restaurants be produced and processed in an environmentally sustainable and socially responsible manner. Approaches by major grocery retailers to demonstrate that their seafood comes from sustainable fisheries have been diverse, with each individual chain employing different measures. There has been a recent proliferation of programmes assessing the sustainability of individual fisheries or seafood species available to retailers. These include in-house retailer programmes, ranging from the assessment of fisheries against retailer-established sustainability criteria; individual retailer partnerships with environmental non-governmental organizations who conduct assessments and make recommendations for sustainable seafood sourcing; and use of a retailer eco-label. There are also numerous third-party programmes for marine capture fisheries, including eco-labelling programmes, and consumer guides, which assess the sustainability of individual fisheries, rank the relative sustainability of individual seafood species, or rank retailers based on the sustainability of their seafood sourcing practices.\nRoundtable participants agreed that international management of commercial tuna fisheries’ sustainability through regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) requires improvements. Tuna fishing companies want RFMOs to be successful, recognizing that the long-term viability of their businesses rely on the availability of tuna resources at sustainable and optimal levels. In some areas, RFMO management improvements are required to address the overcapacity of tuna fleets, allow rebuilding needed for some tuna stocks and avoid and minimize adverse ecosystem effects of tuna fisheries, including bycatch of sensitive species groups and the catch and discarded bycatch of juvenile and undersized tunas. Furthermore, international management has generally not been successful in addressing problems created by substantial illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which hampers the effective management of tuna fisheries.\nRFMO management ineffectiveness has occurred, in part, due to low compliance by member states with RFMO measures and because consensus-based decision-making has often prevented the adoption of appropriate measures. The tuna industry recognizes it can play a significant role towards preventing overexploitation of tuna stocks and reversing it when it occurs, addressing bycatch issues, enhancing data collection and communication, and improving management. To address these problems, participants agreed to increase retail, processor, buyer, distributor and tuna fishing industry participation in RFMO activities to push for adoption of and compliance with legally binding measures to achieve sustainable tuna fisheries. Participants discussed benefits from the establishment of national competent authorities for fishery sustainability certification and labelling.\nEco-labelling and other certification programmes were seen as having the potential to provide an important, complementary, market-driven incentive to improve tuna fisheries’ sustainability. There was discussion, but a lack of consensus, regarding the utility of certification programmes in providing independent, third-party (in some cases, peer-reviewed) verification of the success of fishery management. Participants discussed how third party assessments rely largely on government-collected fishery data, including fishery data held by RFMOs. There was, however, general consensus that certification programmes provide the fishing industry with incentives to push their national governments and RFMOs to engage in better management. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries was agreed to be an appropriate starting point as a global, single set of standards against which to assess the sustainability of individual marine capture fisheries. These minimum standards address the: (i) adequacy of the fisheries management systems, (ii) the health of stocks under consideration, and (iii) ecosystem effects (e.g., bycatch of sensitive species groups, habitat effects from fishing gear, status of stocks of non-target catch, impacts on dependent predators).\nRoundtable participants recognized that several programmes which assess the sustainability of marine capture fisheries already exist, and that some have room for improvement, including in their accuracy and scientific rigor, and in how they convey results to consumers. Participants identified examples of programmes that make recommendations on seafood procurement, including some seafood certification programmes, which have been overly simplistic, relied on incorrect or incomplete information, made broad generalizations, and disseminated misleading or incorrect information. These concerns could be addressed through augmented scientific vigour in assessment methods, and improvements in how information is conveyed to the consumer. To this end, participants agreed to improve communication of how to improve tuna fisheries’ sustainability and the basis for tuna sourcing decisions.\nFurthermore, participants expressed interest in a single set of global minimum sustainability standards as a means to address confusion and diminished confidence by consumers, environmental groups, and the fishing and seafood industries in assessment results created by there being numerous and a rapidly growing number of competing programmes. Examples of competing certification programmes with conflicting opinions on the sustainability of individual fisheries were noted to highlight this issue. Participants agreed that, while the development of assessment methods and certification programmes for marine capture fisheries are in an initial stage, sustainability issues and certification in fisheries are likely to remain key issues in seafood markets for the foreseeable future. Participants agreed to continue communication between the retailer, buyer, distributor, processor and fishing industry sectors to address their demand for global, harmonized standards against which the sustainability of tuna fisheries can be assessed, and involvement in the evolving use of market-based tools for sustainable sourcing of tuna products.\nThe meeting was co-hosted by IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) (www.iucn.org) and the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (www.wpcouncil.org) with sponsorship provided by the Sea Fish Industry Authority, UK (www.seafish.org), Royal Caribbean International (www.royalcaribbean.com) and the Hawaii Longline Association (hawaiilongline.org).

{"text": "|Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) Detachment\nSigns and Symptoms\nIn most instances, serous detachment of the RPE occurs asymptomatically.\nOnly in those cases in which the macula is affected will patients report blurred vision,\nmetamorphopsia, micropsia, or positive scotomas. Other associated clinical findings may\ninclude induced hyperopia and delayed retinal recovery time on the photostress test. Most\nindividuals with RPE detachment are male, between the ages of 20 and 60 years. The history\noften reveals predisposing or concurrent ocular conditions such as macular degeneration,\nidiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy (ICSC), angioid streaks, presumed ocular\nhistoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), or hereditary choroidal degeneration. In other cases, the\ncondition occurs idiopathically.\nRPE detachment appears ophthalmoscopically as single or multiple,\nwell-circumscribed round or oval lesions within the posterior fundus. The lesions are\ntypically dome-shaped with slight elevation and appear yellow to orange in color. A\nreddish \"halo\" is often seen around the base of the detachment, and overlying\npigment defects such as clumping or mottling are commonplace. Lesions may vary in size\nfrom one-fifth to over 5 disc diameters (DD), but most are less than 1 DD. Fluorescein and\nindocyanine green (ICG) angiography show early hyperfluorescence of the entire RPE\ndetachment, which persists throughout the angiogram demonstrating late pooling. Leakage\ninto the sensory retina occurs only in cases of concurrent serous retinal detachment.\nRPE detachment is a non-specific anatomical alteration that may result from\nany number of choroidal disorders that disrupt the normal junction between the basement\nmembrane of the RPE and the inner collagenous layer of Bruchs membrane. This\ndisruption permits serous fluid from the underlying choriocapillaris to gain access into\nthe sub-RPE space. Age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascular membranes, high\nmyopia, angioid streaks, hereditary choroidal degeneration, POHS, and tumors of the\nchoroid have all been identified as precipitating conditions in the development of RPE\ndetachment. Idiopathic cases are sometimes associated with ICSC; some believe these two\nconditions to represent a continuum of a similar underlying pathology. Uncomplicated\nidiopathic serous detachments of the RPE often resolve spontaneously, however, those\nassociated with more generalized damage to the choriocapillaris may be complicated by\nhemorrhage, choroidal neovascular membrane formation, and disciform scarring.\nMost patients under the age of 55 who present with small serous RPE\ndetachments without evidence of other retinal or choroidal disease enjoy an excellent\nprognosis without intervention. This is particularly true if the lesion is outside of the\nfovea and there is no associated subretinal fluid.\nOlder patients who manifest RPE detachment without angiographic evidence\nof a choroidal neovascular membrane have a 25-30 percent chance of developing such\nmembranes during their lifetime, and therefore warrant careful observation as well as\nweekly home monitoring with an Amsler grid.\nThose patients over the age of 55 who present with associated choroidal\nneovascular membranes and/or hemorrhagic RPE detachments have an exceedingly poor visual\nprognosis. Focal laser photocoagulation is indicated for these patients.\nApproximately 90 percent of cases of RPE detachment have\nor will manifest concurrent serous retinal detachment over the natural history of the\ndisorder. In cases of idiopathic RPE detachment, a striking similarity with ICSC is seen\nin the predisposed patient population; i.e. male, average age of 44 years, and a moderate\nto severe emotional stress level.\nThe presentation of RPE detachment is quite\ncharacteristic. Nonetheless, one must be sure to rule out other conditions that may appear\nsimilar from an ophthalmoscopic perspective.

{"text": "Bastoy, Norway (CNN) -- Jan Petter Vala, who is serving a prison sentence for murder, has hands the size of dinner plates and shoulders like those of an ox. In an alcoholic rage, he used his brutish strength to strangle his girlfriend to death a few years ago.\nOn a recent Thursday, however, at this summer-camp-like island prison in southern Norway, where convicts hold keys to their rooms and there are no armed guards or fences, Vala used those same enormous hands to help bring life into the world.\nThe 42-year-old murderer stood watch while an oversize cow gave birth to a wobbly, long-legged, brown-and-white calf. He cried as the baby was born, he said, and wiped slime off of the newborn's face so she could gulp her first breath.\nAfterward, Vala called his own mother to share the good news.\n\"I told my family that I'm going to be a dad,\" he said, beaming with pride.\nThis is exactly the type of dramatic turnabout -- enraged killer to gentle-giant midwife -- that corrections officials in Norway hope to create with this controversial, one-of-a-kind prison, arguably the cushiest the world has to offer.\nFounded in 1982, Bastoy Prison is located on a lush, 1-square-mile island of pine trees and rocky coasts, with views of the ocean that are postcard-worthy. It feels more like a resort than jail, and prisoners here enjoy freedoms that would be unthinkable elsewhere.\nIt's the holiday version of Alcatraz.\nThere's a beach where prisoners sunbathe in the summer, plenty of good fishing spots, a sauna and tennis courts. Horses roam gravel roads. Some of the 115 prisoners here -- all men and serving time for murder, rape and trafficking heroin, among other crimes -- stay in wooden cottages, painted cheery red. They come and go as they please. Others live in \"The Big House,\" a white mansion on a hill that, on the inside, looks like a college dorm. A chicken lives in the basement, a guard said, and provides eggs for the inmates.\nWhen you ask the cook what's for dinner, he offers up menu choices like \"fish balls with white sauce, with shrimps\" and \"everything from chicken con carne to salmon.\"\nPlenty of people would pay to vacation in a place like this.\nOn first read, all of that probably sounds infuriating. Shouldn't these men be punished? Why do they get access to all these comforts while others live in poverty?\nBut if the goal of prison is to change people, Bastoy seems to work.\n\"If we have created a holiday camp for criminals here, so what?\" asked Arne Kvernvik Nilsen, the prison's governor and a former minister and psychologist. He added, \"We should reduce the risk of reoffending, because if we don't, what's the point of punishment, except for leaning toward the primitive side of humanity?\"\nTake a quick look at the numbers: Only 20% of prisoners who come through Norway's prisons reoffend within two years of being released, according to a 2010 report commissioned by the governments of several Nordic countries.\nAt Bastoy, that figure is even lower, officials say: about 16%.\nCompare that with the three-year re-offense rate for state prisons in the U.S.: 43%, according to a 2011 report from the Pew Center on the States, a nonpartisan research group. Older government reports put that number even higher, at more than five in 10.\nRyan King, a research director at Pew and an author of the group's recent report, said it's difficult to compare recidivism rates from state to state, much less from country to country. Instead of focusing on the numbers, he said, one should focus on what a country is or isn't doing to tackle re-offense rates.\nStill, Bastoy remains controversial even in academia. Irvin Waller, president of the International Organization for Victim Assistance and a professor at the University of Ottawa, said in an e-mail that the relative niceness of a prison has no effect on whether people commit crimes when they're released. \"The key is not that much what happens in prison but what happens when the men are released,\" he said.\nBut officials here maintain that their methods do make a difference, and they follow it up with post-release programs. The aim of Bastoy is not to punish or seek revenge, Nilsen said. The only punishment is to take away the prisoner's right to be a free member of society.\nEven at a time when Anders Behring Breivik is on trial in Norway for killing 77 people in a terror attack last year -- and the remote possibility he could end up at Bastoy or a similar prison some day -- Nilsen and others stand up for this brand of justice.\nLife at Bastoy\nTo understand Norway's pleasant-prison philosophy, first you have to get a sense of how life at a cushy, low-security prison like Bastoy actually plays out.\nThere are few rules here. Prisoners can have TVs in their rooms, provided they bring them from \"outside\" when they're sentenced. They wear whatever clothes they want: jeans, T-shirts. One man had a sweater with pink-and-gray horizontal stripes, but that's as close as it got to the jailbird look. Even guards aren't dressed in uniform, which makes conducting interviews tricky. It's impossible to tell an officer from a drug trafficker.\nA common opening question: \"So, do you live here?\"\nEveryone at Bastoy has a job, and prisoners must report to work from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. weekdays. Some people garden; others farm. Some chop down trees and slice them into firewood (It's hard not to think about the wood chipper scene in \"Fargo\" when you see inmates filleting tree trunks with an enormous circular saw). Others tend to a team of horses, which are used to cart wood and supplies from one part of the island to another. Everyone moves about freely during these tasks. Guards are sometimes present, sometimes not. No one wears shackles or electronic monitoring bracelets.\nThe idea is for prison to function like a small, self-sustaining village.\nFor their work, inmates are paid. They get a stipend of 59 Norwegian kroner per day, about $10. They can save that money or spend it on odds and ends in a local shop. Additionally, they get a monthly stipend of about $125 for their food. Kitchen workers -- that's another inmate job -- serve Bastoy residents dinner each day. For breakfast and lunch, inmates use their stipend to make purchases in the local shop and then cook for themselves at home. Many live in small houses that have full kitchens. Others have access to shared cooking space.\nThe goal, Nilsen said, is to create an environment where people can build self-esteem and reform their lives. \"They look at themselves in the mirror, and they think, 'I am s***. I don't care. I am nothing,' \" he said. This prison, he says, gives them a chance to see they have worth, \"to discover, 'I'm not such a bad guy.' \"\nIn locked-down prisons, inmates are treated \"like animals or robots,\" he said, moving from one planned station to the next, with no choice in the matter. Here, inmates are forced to make choices -- to learn how to be better people.\nPrisoners, of course, appreciate this approach.\nKjell Amundsen, a 70-year-old who said he is in jail for a white-collar financial crime, was terrified when he rode the 15-minute ferry from the mainland out to Bastoy.\nOn a recent afternoon, he was sweeping up in a plant nursery while John Lennon's \"Imagine\" played on the radio. \"I think it's marvelous to be in a prison this way,\" he said.\nHe plans to keep up the task after his sentence ends. \"I'm living in a flat (when I get out), but I am convinced I should have a little garden,\" he said.\nSome prisoners get schooling in a yellow Bavarian-style building near the center of the island. On a recent afternoon, three young men were learning to use computer programs to create 3-D models of cars. All expressed interest in doing this sort of work after their prison terms end.\nTom Remi Berg, a 22-year-old who said he is in prison for the third time after getting into a bar fight and beating a man nearly to death, said he is finally learning his lesson at Bastoy.\nHe works in the kitchen and is seeking training to become a chef when he's released. He also plays in the prison blues band -- Guilty as Hell -- and lives with his bandmates.\n\"It's good to have a prison like this,\" he said. \"You can learn to start a new page again.\"\nIf escaped, please call\nThe prisoners are required to check in several times a day so guards can make sure they're still on the island. Nothing but 1½ miles of seawater stops them from leaving; they'd only have to steal one of the prison's boats to cross it, several inmates said.\nAn escape would be relatively easy.\nPrisoners have tried to escape in the past. One swam halfway across the channel and became stranded on a buoy and screamed for rescuers to help, prison officials said. Another made it across the channel by stealing a boat but was caught on the other side.\nMany, however, don't want to leave. If they tried and failed, they would be forced to go to a higher-security prison and could have their sentences extended.\nWhen inmates come to his island jail, Nilsen, the governor, gives them a little talk.\nAmong the wisdom he imparts is this: If you should escape and make it across the water to the free shore, find a phone and call so I know you're OK and \"so we don't have to send the coast guard looking for you.\"\nThis kind of trust may seem shocking or naïve from the outside, but it's the entire basis for Bastoy's existence. Overnight, only three or four guards (the prison employs 71 administrative staff, including the guards) stay on the island with this group of people who have been convicted of serious crimes. If guards carried weapons (which they don't) it might encourage inmates to take up arms, too, he said.\nFurther complicating the security situation, some inmates, toward the end of their terms, are allowed to leave the island on a daily ferry to work or attend classes on the mainland.\nThey're expected to come back on their own free will.\nInmates are screened to make sure they're mentally stable and unlikely to plot an escape before they come to Bastoy. The vast majority -- 97%, according to Nilsen -- have served part of their sentences at higher-security jails in Norway. In the four years Nilsen has been heading up the prison, there have been no \"serious\" incidents of violence, he said.\nBy the time they get to Bastoy, inmates view the island as a relief.\n'It's still prison'\nThere's a question inmates here get asked frequently: When your sentence is up, will you want to leave?\nThe answer, despite the nice conditions, is always an emphatic yes.\n\"It's still prison,\" said Luke, 23. He didn't want his full name used for fear future employers would see it. \"In your mind, you are locked (up).\"\nThe simple fact of being taken away from family members is enough to stop Benny, 40, from wanting to offend again. The refugee from Kosovo said he was convicted on drug charges after he was found with 13 pounds of heroin. He didn't want his full name used because he doesn't want to embarrass his family or jeopardize his chance of finding a job after he's released.\nBefore coming to Bastoy, he sat in a higher-security prison while one of his children was born.\n\"It doesn't matter how long the sentences get. The sentence doesn't matter,\" Benny said. \"When you take freedom from people, that's what's scary.\"\nThere are only 3,600 people in prison in this country, compared with 2.3 million in the United States, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Relative to population, the U.S. has about 10 times as many inmates as Norway.\nMore than 89% of Norway's jail sentences are less than a year, officials said. In U.S. federal prisons, longer sentences are much more common, with fewer than 2% serving a year or less, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\nSome researchers support Norway's efforts to lighten sentences.\nThink of prison like parenting and it starts to make sense, said Mark A.R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at UCLA and author of \"When Brute Force Fails.\"\n\"Every parent knows this. What if you tried to discipline your kid by saying, 'If you don't clean your room, there's a 10% chance I'll kick you out of the house and never see you again'?\" he said, referencing the fact that many crimes in America go unpunished, but the justice system issues harsh sentences when offenders are caught. Grounding the child immediately, a softer sentence, would work better, even though the punishment is less severe, he said.\n\"We have a criminal justice system (in the United States) that, if it were a parent, we would say it's abusive and neglectful.\"\nKleiman said victims do have a right to see offenders punished. But in Norway, a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, staying on a resort-like island with horses might feel like punishment to many people, he said.\nResearch also suggests that programs like Bastoy that train inmates for their transition back into the free world -- with education, counseling and such -- do help prisoners adjust.\n\"There is overwhelming evidence that rehabilitation works much better than deterrence as a means of reducing re-offending,\" said Gerhard Ploeg, a senior adviser at the Ministry of Justice, which oversees Norway's corrections system.\n\"It's all in the name of reintegration,\" he added. \"You won't be suddenly one day standing on the street with a plastic bag of things you had when you came in.\"\nMass shooting challenges system\nNorway's unusual prison policies have been pushed into the international spotlight after a bombing and shooting spree last year in which 77 people were killed, including children.\nThere's a chance -- although minimal -- that Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to those crimes, could end up in Bastoy, one of Norway's \"open prisons,\" Nilsen said.\nIt's more likely Breivik will be sent to one of Norway's many high-security \"closed\" prisons, which look much more like their U.S. counterparts.\nHe also could be set free some day. Norway has a maximum jail sentence of 21 years, which can be extended only when an inmate is deemed to be a real and imminent threat to society. The country expects nearly every prisoner to be returned to society, which influences its efforts to create jail environments that reduce re-offense rates.\n\"The question we must ask is, 'What kind of person do I want as my neighbor?' \" Ploeg said. \"How do we want people to come out of prison? If your neighbor were to come out of prison, what would you want him to be like?\"\nStill, it's likely Breivik's sentence will be extended to the point that he will spend his life in a high-security prison, he said. Or he could go into life-long psychiatric care.\nBreivik's case challenges a system that hopes to fix everyone.\nThe case has unearthed levels of anger that are uncharacteristic of Norway, which prides itself as a home for conflict mediation and human rights, a place that hosts the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony and has one of the best standards of living in the world.\nLast week, a man lit himself on fire outside the Oslo courthouse where Breivik's trial is taking place. His motives were unclear, police said.\n\"(Breivik) doesn't deserve to go to prison,\" said Camilla Bjerke, 27, who tends bar in Horten, the town on the other side of the water from Bastoy. \"He deserves to be hanged outside the courthouse. ... He's just going to go into prison and watch TV and download movies.\"\nThen there's this sentiment: If Breivik were ever released into the public, someone would kill him, several Norwegians said. Inmates at Bastoy echoed those sentiments, saying he would have to be quarantined or he wouldn't be safe on the island.\nOthers are trying to fight that anger.\nBjorn Ihler, a 20-year-old who narrowly escaped Breivik's shooting spree by diving into the ocean with two children while bullets flew at them, said, \"it's very important that we don't let this terrorist change the way we are and the way things work.\"\n\"The prison system in Norway is based around the principle of getting criminals back into society, really, and away from their criminal life -- and to get them normal jobs and stuff like that,\" he said.\nHe doesn't know how he would feel if Breivik were to be released, but he would like the system to function as usual. \"So prisons must be very much focused on getting people to a place where they are able to live normal, non-criminal lives. And that's the best way of preserving society from crime, I think.\"\nLooking to the future\nAll of these efforts aim to help a person like Vala, the gentle giant who strangled his girlfriend, to get ready for release back into society at the end of his 10-year sentence.\nAfter he helped a toddling calf come into the world, Vala said, he leaned on a rail next to the cow's pen and thought about his life and the murder that landed him here. The symbolism that he had used his hands to end one life and help begin another was not lost on him. \"I stayed for six hours,\" he said. \"It was very beautiful.\"\nThe night he killed his girlfriend, Vala says, he blacked out and then came to with his hands around her neck, after she was dead.\n\"We never fight,\" he said. \"We never do. So I don't know what happened.\"\nHe felt helpless and out of control when he came to.\nBut now he's trying to pull it together. He decided to quit drinking for good. And when he's working with animals, he said, feels a new calm wash over him.\nIt's a change the prison guards have noted, too. Sigurd Vedvik said he met Vala while he was serving out the earlier part of his sentence in a high-security prison. Vedvik was screening him for entry into Bastoy. Vala barely could communicate. He seemed broken.\n\"When he first came here, he was very afraid of many people,\" said Vedvik, who sees himself as more of a teacher or social worker than a person who enforces security.\nNow, Vala is making friends. Talking more. Taking responsibility for the cattle he's tasked with caring for. He strokes the cows' necks so gently, it seems as if he's worried they will shatter.\nWhen Vala leaves Bastoy, he plans to go into the construction business and hopes to find some way to spend time on a farm.\n\"I'm trying to think to my future.\"\nThat's something he couldn't do after the murder.\nAnd it took a posh prison -- one with cattle and horses -- to get him into that state of mind.", "id": "<urn:uuid:818ddabc-8305-4673-a133-d71e3d96e404>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cnn.org/2012/05/24/world/europe/norway-prison-bastoy-nicest/index.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:33:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9801374673843384, "token_count": 4216, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "WASHINGTON — As Marylanders join millions of others nationwide in the computer shopping blitz that’s become known as Cyber Monday, they should think about this: If they paid the sales tax they owe to the state for such purchases, Maryland would be $200 million richer.\nThe problem is, virtually no one pays, and the state’s top tax enforcement officer doesn’t believe they should.\nOnline buyers are supposed to pay sales taxes for their purchases by Jan. 21, 2013, one of the four deadlines a year for Maryland residents to file their “use tax.” This use tax is imposed on any purchase that is not taxed by the seller, whether it be out of a catalog, from an Internet retailer or even from a store in Delaware, which does not impose sales taxes. If the good is being used in Maryland by a state resident and has not been taxed, that person is required to pay the 6 percent tax.\nState Comptroller Peter Franchot said between consumers’ lack of knowledge of this tax and an inability to enforce it, over 95 percent of the Maryland public is breaking the law. However, the comptroller said he would not enforce it.\n“I am not comfortable in enforcing that and will not,” said Franchot, who said it is not the citizen’s fault there is not a “sensible” compliance program for online sales tax. “The collection of sales tax is a responsibility of government and industry, not the consumer.”\nThis use tax is almost impossible to enforce, Franchot said, and is costing the state around $200 million a year in tax revenue, with that number only increasing as e-commerce grows. The comptroller’s office estimates that by 2020 the lost tax revenue will be more than $310 million.\nEven if this lost tax revenue was collected, Franchot said it’s unlikely that other tax increases, like the recent tax hike on those making $100,000 or more, would go away.\n“Maryland has an insatiable appetite to raise taxes, so I would doubt that the Internet tax revenues would substitute for some other tax increase,” said Franchot. “They’d just do both.”\nDee Hodges, president of the Maryland Taxpayers Association, said her organization opposes the use tax, saying it is “more regulation of the Internet,” and “a way of shutting down commerce.”\nIf the tax replaced another tax in the state, Hodges said she would consider supporting it. Maryland already grossly overtaxes its residents, she said.\n“Pretty soon they’ll have a bill to tax oxygen,” said Hodges.\nFranchot said this problem is better solved by the U.S. government than the state, as it involves interstate commerce and companies outside Maryland’s jurisdiction.\nFor many bricks-and-mortar retailers, the issue is one of equality. They say they can’t fairly compete against online retailers who don’t charge sales tax, while the state’s physical retailers must.\nMultiple bills in the House and Senate tackle this problem, including the Main Street Fairness Act, the Marketplace Equity Act and the Marketplace Fairness Act.\nIn the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, the court found that a business does not have to collect taxes on customer purchases unless it has a physical location in the state. However, Associate Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court “that the underlying issue is not only one that Congress may be better qualified to resolve, but also one that Congress has the ultimate power to resolve.”\nU.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Baltimore, is a cosponsor of the Marketplace Fairness Act, which was introduced over a year ago and is yet to come out of committee.\n“Maryland retailers aren’t looking for special treatment but simply a fair way to compete against large Internet sellers who charge similar prices but get away without collecting sales tax,” Cardin said in an April hearing on the bill.\nMaryland Retailers Association President Patrick Donoho agreed, saying this “give(s) an added incentive to use one retailer over another.” Donoho says while 6 percent may not sound like a lot, the success of the state’s summer, tax-free week underscores the fact that consumers do care.\nDonoho cited the example of a jeweler who had a customer come in with a $10,000 ring purchased online. When the jeweler said it would cost $100 to resize, the customer was upset. Meanwhile, by purchasing the ring from an online retailer without a state location, the customer avoided paying the $600 in sales tax.\n“I think what has happened is that technology and the market has so radically changed that our laws don’t, have not kept up with them,” said Donoho. “It has to get fixed because you can’t pick winners and losers.”\nJoseph Bailey, a research associate professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, said he sees why this tax is so impossible to collect.\n“The burden of collecting the tax moves from the seller to the buyer,” said Bailey. While he agrees the federal government needs to solve the problem, he said it might be the rough economy, and not partisan gridlock, that is stopping bills like the Marketplace Fairness Act from moving through.\n“I think it’s a very difficult thing to do regardless of politics,” said Bailey, who added he believes the economic landscape has to change before customers will accept another tax.\nAmy Gruner, 20, said she often shops online at places like Nordstrom, Forever 21 and Amazon, but had not noticed that some places charge sales tax while others do not. The Annapolis native said she was slightly alarmed to find out she should be paying sales tax on all purchases online.\n“It will hurt (Maryland businesses) if Amazon is not charging. Then people would go to Amazon more often than going to other places that do have that sales tax,” said Gruner.\nRobert Craynon, an 18-year-old Bowie resident, said he understands the problem for businesses in the state.\n“It gives the online (retailers) a kind of unfair advantage in some ways,” said Craynon.\nFranchot agreed not enforcing the tax hurts Maryland businesses, but because he can’t fix the problem, he won’t be collecting the tax anytime soon.\n“I have zero interest in making the overtaxed citizens of the state of Maryland guilty of some kind of felony for non-payment of a remote sales tax.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:5ad781e8-cb13-418e-ae22-ac1aaf4bd5b5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://cnsmaryland.org/2012/11/21/maryland-online-sales-tax-ignored-by-enforcers-customers/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:29:52Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9667935371398926, "token_count": 1431, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

I do not know why, but in mid-June I became obsessed with the idea of wide leg pants with big polka dots. Had to have them! I had the perfect pattern on order, Vogue 8584 - it was targeted for my brown and black linen pants this fall. And good old JoAnns had the perfect fabric - chocolate calico with big white dots. Off and running!\nThe pattern has lots of options. Belt carriers (5 loops - yes, there is a carrier at center back), three hem looks, 2 pockets styles, drawstring waist, and a belt pattern! I chose the long pants, plain waist and hem, belt carriers, and gathered pockets.\n|Blouse, Simplicity 1806|\nSandals, Chinese Laundry\nBraided Belt, Dillards\nI sewed a 14 and got a really nice fit. Vogue 14 is for 38\" hips and this pattern is spot-on for me. I shortened the rise by taking 1/2\" off the top edge (which is folded to form the waistline casing).\nThe pocket style I chose is self-faced at the top to form a casing and gathered with a drawstring. Not! Here's what I did instead:\n- Ease-stitched 1/4\" from the upper edge and at the top fold line, using a long stitch. This helps with the next step.\n- Folded the casing and turned under the raw edge. I used the ease stitching to draw up the curve on the turned edge. Then I topstitched 1/4\" from the fold and close to the turned edge.\n- And inserted 3/8\" elastic.\n- I checked the pattern markings for the distance between the top pocket corners - 8\". And drew up the elastic so that the pocket would be 8 1/2\" wide when finished and sewn on the pants leg. I wanted a little softness in the look, not a flat pocket, so the extra 1/2\".\n- My last step was to use the drawstring pattern provided, but make it much shorter. I did one overhand knot at the center of the tie and attached it to the middle of the gathered casing. (I would show this in a pic as well, but you can't really see it on this fabric).

{"text": "First - you might want to redefine you search. Are you looking for happiness or rather positive affect? Happiness is fairly ambigious term, and it's much more associated with positive psychology studies on well-being. If you are interested in more global definition of happiness, check the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.\nOn the other hand, there is a large number of studies on physiological measurements of positive affect.\nOne such physiological measurement is Electromyography (EMG) - recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG will detect very brief smiles or higher activity in cheek muscles (zygomaticus major) which are correlated with positive affect. There is quite classic (but very quoted) paper on that:\nCacioppo JT, Petty RE, Losch ME, Kim HS. (1986) Electromyographic\nActivity Over Facial Muscle Regions Can Differentiate the Valence and\nIntensity of Affective Reactions. J Pers Soc Psychol., 50(2):260-8. download\nAnother simple physiological assesment is heart rate measured by the interbeat interval (IBI). For example, study by Brosschot & Thayer (2003) shows that heart rate response is longer after negative emotions than after positive emotions.\nBrosschot JF, Thayer JF. (2003) Heart rate response is longer after\nnegative emotions than after positive emotions. Int J Psychophysiol.,\nIn fact, the full spectrum of somatic measurements have been used along heart rate including pulse transmission time to the finger, skin conductance level or pupil dilation (Partala, 2003).

{"text": "Is this bone a Neanderthal flute?\nCave Bear femur fragment from Slovenia, 43+kya\nDOUBTS AIRED OVER NEANDERTHAL BONE 'FLUTE'\n(AND REPLY BY MUSICOLOGIST BOB FINK)\nScience News 153 (April 4, 1998): 215.\nBy B. Bower\nAmid much media fanfare, a research team in 1996 trumpeted an ancient, hollowed out bear bone pierced on one side with four complete or partial holes as the earliest known musical instrument. The perforated bone, found in an Eastern European cave, represents a flute made and played by Neandertals at least 43,000 ye us ago, the scientists contended.\nNow it's time to stop the music, say two archaeologists who examined the purported flute last spring. On closer inspection, the bone appears to have been punctured and gnawed by the teeth of an animal -- perhaps a wolf -- as it stripped the limb of meat and marrow report, April Nowell and Philip G. Chase, both of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \"The bone was heavily chewed by one or more carnivores, creating holes that became more rounded due to natural processes after burial,\" Nowell says. \"It provides very weak evidence for the origins of [Stone Age] music.\" Nowell presented the new analysis at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society in Seattle last week.\nNowell and Chase examined the bone with the permission of its discoverer, Ivan Turk of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana (S.N.: 11/23/96, p. 328). Turk knows of their conclusion but still views the specimen as a flute.\nBoth open ends of the thighbone contain clear signs of gnawing by carnivores, Nowell asserts. Wolves and other animals typically bite off nutrient-rich tissue at the ends of limb bones and extract available marrow. If Neandertals had hollowed out the bone and fashioned holes in it, animals would not have bothered to gnaw it, she says.\nComplete and partial holes on the bone's shaft were also made by carnivores, says Nowell. Carnivores typically break open bones with their scissor like cheek teeth. Uneven bone thickness and signs of wear along the borders of the holes, products of extended burial in the soil, indicate that openings made by cheek teeth were at first less rounded and slightly smaller, the researchers hold.\nMoreover, the simultaneous pressure of an upper and lower tooth produced a set of opposing holes, one partial and one complete, they maintain.\nPrehistoric, carnivore-chewed bear bones in two Spanish caves display circular punctures aligned in much the same way as those on the Slovenian find. In the March Antiquity, Francesco d'Errico of the Institute of Quaternary Prehistory and Geology in Talence, France, and his colleagues describe the Spanish bones.\nIn a different twist, Bob Fink, an independent musicologist in Canada, has reported\non the Internet\n(http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm) that the spacing of the two complete and two partial holes on the back of the Slovenian bone conforms to musical notes on the diatonic (do, re, mi. . .) scale.\nThe bone is too short to incorporate the diatonic scale's seven notes, counter Nowell and Chase. Working with Pennsylvania musicologist Robert Judd, they estimate that the find's 5.7-inch length is less than half that needed to cover the diatonic spectrum. The recent meeting presentation is \"a most convincing analysis,\" comments J. Desmond Clark of the University of California, Berkeley, although it's possible that Neandertals blew single notes through carnivore-chewed holes in the bone.\n\"We can't exclude that possibility,\" Nowell responds. \"But it's a big leap of faith to conclude that this was an intentionally constructed flute.\"\nTO THE EDITOR, SCIENCE NEWS (REPLY BY BOB FINK, May 1998)\n(See an update of this discussion on Bob Fink's web site, November 2000)\nThe doubts raised by Nowell and Chase (April 4th, DOUBTS AIRED OVER NEANDERTHAL BONE 'FLUTE') saying the Neanderthal Bone is not a flute have these weaknesses:\nThe alignment of the holes -- all in a row, and all of equivalent diameter, appear to be contrary to most teeth marks, unless some holes were made independently by several animals. The latter case boggles the odds for the holes ending up being in line. It also would be strange that animals homed in on this one bone in a cave full of bones, where no reports of similarly chewed bones have been made.\nThis claim is harder to believe when it is calculated that chances for holes to\nbe arranged, by chance, in a pattern that matches the spacings of 4 notes of a\ndiatonic flute, are only one in hundreds to occur .\nThe analysis I made on the Internet (http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm) regarding the bone being capable of matching 4 notes of the do, re, mi (diatonic) scale included the possibility that the bone was extended with another bone \"mouthpiece\" sufficiently long to make the notes sound fairly in tune. While Nowell says \"it's a big leap of faith to conclude that this was an intentionally constructed flute,\" it's a bigger leap of faith to accept the immense coincidence that animals blindly created a hole-spacing pattern with holes all in line (in what clearly looks like so many other known bone flutes which are made to play notes in a step-wise scale) and blindly create a pattern that also could play a known acoustic scale if the bone was extended. That's too much coincidence for me to accept. It is more likely that it is an intentionally made flute, although admittedly with only the barest of clues regarding its original condition.\nThe 5.7 inch figure your article quoted appears erroneous, as the centimeter scale provided by its discoverer, Ivan Turk, indicates the artifact is about 4.3 inches long. However, the unbroken femur would originally have been about 8.5 inches, and the possibility of an additional hole or two exists, to complete a full scale, perhaps aided by the possible thumbhole. However, the full diatonic spectrum is not required as indicated by Nowell and Chase: It could also have been a simpler (but still diatonic) 4 or 5 note scale. Such short-scale flutes are plentiful in homo sapiens history.\nFinally, a worn-out or broken flute bone can serve as a scoop for manipulation of food, explaining why animals might chew on its ends later. It is also well-known that dogs chase and maul even sticks, despite their non-nutritional nature. What appears \"weak\" is not the case for a flute, but the case against it by Nowell and Chase.\nLetter to the Editor: Antiquity Journal:\n\"A Bone to Pick\"\nBy Bob Fink\nI have a bone to pick with Francesco d'Errico's viewpoint in the March issue of Antiquity (article too long to reproduce here) regarding the Neanderthal flute found in Slovenia by Ivan Turk. D'Errico argues the bone artifact is not a flute.\nD'Errico omits dealing with the best evidence that this bone find is a flute.\nRegarding the most important evidence, that of the holes being lined up, neither d'Errico nor Turk make mention of this.\nThis line-up is remarkable especially if they were made by more than one carnivore, which apparently they'd have to be, based on Turk's analysis of the center-spans of the holes precluding their being made by a single carnivore or bite (Turk,* pp.171-175). To account for this possible difficulty, some doubters do mention \"one or more\" carnivores (Chase & Nowell, Science News 4/4/98).\nMy arguments over the past year pointed out the mathematical odds of the lining up of the holes occurring by chance-chewing are too difficult to believe.\nThe Appendix in my essay (\"Neanderthal Flute --A Musicological Analysis\") proves that the number of ways a set of 4 random holes could be differently spaced (to produce an audibly different set of tones) are 680 ways. The chances a random set would match the existing fragment's spacing [which also could produce a match to four diatonic notes of the scale] are therefore only one in hundreds. If, in calculating the odds, you also allowed the holes to be out of line, or to be less than 4 holes as well, then the chance of a line-up match is only one from many tens of thousands.\nAnd yet randomness and animal bites still are acceptable to account for holes being in line that could also play some notes of the scale? This is too much coincidence for me to believe occurred by chance.\nD'Errico mentions my essay in his article and what he thought it was about, but he overstates my case into being a less believable one. My case simply was that if the bone was long enough (or a shorter bone extended by a mouthpiece insert) then the 4 holes would be consistent and in tune with the sounds of Do, Re, Mi, Fa (or flat Mi, Fa, Sol, and flat La in a minor scale).\nIn the 5 points I list below, extracted from Turk's monograph in support of this being a flute, d'Errico omits dealing with much of the first, and all of the second, fourth and sixth points.\nTurk & Co's monograph shows the presence on site of boring tools, and includes experiments made by Turk's colleague Guiliano Bastiani who successfully produced similar holes in fresh bone using tools of the type found at the site (pp. 176-78 Turk).\nThey also wrote (pp. 171-75) that:\n1. The center-to-center distances of the holes in the artifact are smaller than that of the tooth spans of most carnivores. The smallest tooth spans they found were 45mm, and the holes on the bone are 35mm (or less) apart;\n2. Holes bitten are usually at the ends of bones rather than in the center of them;\n3. There is an absence of dents, scratches and other signs of gnawing and counter-bites on the artifact;\n4. The center-to-center distances do not correspond to the spans of carnivores which could pierce the bone;\n5. The diameters of the holes are greater than that producible by a wolf exerting the greatest jaw pressure it had available -- it's doubtful that a wolf's jaws would be strong enough (like a hyena's) to have made the holes, especially in the thickest part of the wall of the artifact.\n6. If you accept one or more carnivores, then why did they over-target one bone, when there were so many other bones in the cave site? Only about 4.5% of the juvenile bones were chewed or had holes, according to Turk (p. 117).\n* Turk, Ivan (ed.) (1997). Mousterian Bone Flute.

{"text": "Roadie #42 - Blog #141\nThe fact that I’m sitting amongst a pile of road cases looking over at Chris’s piano must mean that the summer holidays really are over.\nI had intended to go away somewhere nice for a week or two. To be honest though, getting on a plane wasn’t top of my list of things to do once we got home from our “round the world in 13 days” mission. By my reckoning, a complete lap of the planet in under two weeks gave us an average speed of over 80 miles an hour for the entire trip. No wonder I quite fancied sitting still for a bit…\nBeing back in the rehearsal room after a four week break though, definitely makes this feel like the first proper day back. In reality, I’ve been slowly easing back in over the last week or so. I’ve been prepping some new songs that’ll be getting a run through during these rehearsals. Paradise is mere days from breaking free from the studio into the big wide world, so learning how to play it live seems like a sensible plan for the band at this stage.\nI have a love hate relationship with rehearsals. I adore the idea of sitting around with all the gear out and no pressure of a gig at 9pm. It’s a chance to tidy up loose ends, go through your work box and generally get your house properly in order before the chaos of touring kicks in. That’s the theory at least. The reality is that it’s always about either getting new songs happening, or making major changes to existing tunes. Given that my corner of things is getting the keyboard rig programming in order, it tends to work out being the most hectic period of all for me.\nTrying to sit at a computer getting Dav Rossi’s string section and Will’s programmed beats all lined up and ready to go can be murder when the rest of crew giving it “One Two One Two”, or turning the amps up to stun. For this reason, I tend to stay late. An hour’s work in silence without interruption usually yields more results than half a day of not being able to hear yourself think. It never makes you popular with the fella that works here who’s sitting waiting to lock up, mind.\nI remember that this phase of things on X&Y is when I first heard Fix You. Dan Green and I had been up at a studio in west London pulling the multi-tracks apart and I was driving back to the rehearsal room to get to work. It only took a couple of listens for that song to burn itself forever into the brain. Even on a first listen, the degree to which people would take it to their hearts was completely obvious.\nUp In Flames feels the same to me right now. It’s immense. I first heard it when the guys were sound-checking at the iTunes show. Apparently, Chris had started the song the previous night, so it was less than 24 hours old at that point. It was hypnotic in its simplicity, but devastatingly, achingly gorgeous. The final version has lost none of this and is a masterwork of restraint. It hasn’t been crammed with a million ideas and embellishments. Every part is there simply to enhance the emotional impact. I can only predict floods of tears in every quarter.\nDLIBYH couldn’t possibly be heading in any more different a direction emotionally. It’s almost violently life affirming. I remember texting Phil during the Glastonbury rehearsals when they first played Charlie Brown in its live incarnation. I was amazed at how vast and invigorating it sounded. They’re going to blow the sodding walls out when they kick into this one tomorrow…\nAh yes, tomorrow - the band arrive at lunchtime for a full day of rehearsals. I guess I’d better make sure I’m ready…\nSo from a very quiet and empty rehearsal room, I shall bid you goodnight.", "id": "<urn:uuid:180bb1d1-e2e2-4e51-9daa-cfc1b97ca43d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://coldplay.com/archive_pop.php?id=775&iframe=true", "date": "2013-05-18T05:34:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.959816038608551, "token_count": 847, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Learned the Hard Way #1: Output Follow Through\nYou have spent days, even weeks, on your edit. You lived in the footage, heard it in your dreams, might even buy stock in the company you edited it for; its that close to you. The client session went amazing, you made the revisions, and now they want to get it out there. Finally, you are home free. Time to set the computer up for lay-off to tape or maybe to compress a file that’s going to get posted to their website. You hit enter and go do a little arm in arm celebratory swing dance with the single receptionist on your way to smoke a cigar by the dumpster out back. Hazahh! The tape gets shipped out on time or the file gets uploaded successfully to your FTP site, now for margaritas.\nOr this happens…\nRewind! (Cue fast tape rewind sound effect)\nWhat I described above is not how this photo came about, but in a weird delusional way it might be. This was early on in my career, maybe even within the first 2 months. I had to make a couple text changes to a spot that my senior editor had cut. Something in the realm of “Buy 2 cars and you can touch our pup tiger” being changed to “Buy 2 cars and you can touch our pet tiger”. Something important. So the changes were made and I had to make dubs for the stations. I won’t say I didn’t check the tapes in master control, but I certainly didn’t watch the actual layoff and turn the volume up on the speakers to hear at a proper level. On a quick playback everything looked good, changes were apparent, and the audiometers were bouncing. All good, tapes were taken up front to the receptionist and I returned to whatever compressions I was doing before the change request came in.\nThe tapes had 3 30-second spots on them. With bars, slates, and black between spots there was maybe 4 minutes of content on the tapes. Had I taken 4 minutes out of my day to stand in master control and focus, I would have noticed that the audio levels starting to fluctuate midway through the second spot. Had I spend those 4 minutes; I would have realized the audio of the third spot was almost entirely overdriven. It seems our Beta SP deck was deciding to do its own damn thing on one of the input channels and I would have noticed if I had the volume up and actually been listening to it. Needless to say the stations rejected the tapes and my boss got a very passionate call from the owner of the ad agency in charge of the commercials. After much discussion my boss asked what he could do to resolve the situation.I want you to put a stake through the head of the guy who did this.\nMy interpretation was that he wanted to feed me delicious meats, but my boss decided that it would be hilarious to take a photo of yours truly and send it to the ad agency. Those 4 minutes led to one of the most embarrassing things in my professional career, and it is embarrassing to retell it. But that embarrassment taught me one of the most important lessons as well.\nNo matter how good your project is, or how happy the clients are with it in the suite, if it is messed up on output, even a little thing, all the good aspects are negated. That could be an audio issue when laying to tape or it could be some stutters in the final file. If you are watching that final output, it is an opportunity to catch that little something that can embarrass you for the rest of your life.\nFast Forward! (Cue another speeding tape sound effect)\nA couple months ago I was in the final stages of a short film I had been working on for months. It was a labor of love project that I was doing after hours. I was in the process of making all the final deliverables and caught something while checking one of the BluRay discs. It was one shot that didn’t have a vignette were it was supposed to. For a second a little demon on my shoulder spoke up.Seriously, no one is going to notice that. Think of how much work you have to go back and do to fix this. You have to re-render it, you have to make all those files, and you have to re-burn all those discs. You will be the only one that will ever notice this.\nYes, I listened to the little guy for a bit while wanting to cry at the thought of it all. This was a case where no one would send out a photo with a stake through my head, but I would know that mistake was there. All the hard work late at night and on the weekends would be trashed due to something I now had the opportunity to change. Which is the second point. You have to be willing to watch that program you have seen a million times one more time, and you have to be willing to revisit the program if you find something that will leave egg all over your face. Or a picture of you with a stake through your head.\nYes, I did go back and lay that vignette on that shot. I did re-compress the 20-minute short, and make a huge amount of deliverables that took well over 5 hours. But now I can watch that short without feeling nauseous every time it comes to the scene, because I watched the output and caught it. It sucked to have to learn this lesson that way, but it is one of the most important lessons in this field. Ask any of the pros who have been doing it for decades, they all adhere to this because it’s what keeps them employed, and keeps this from happening.\nI’ll never forget, because I learned it the hard way.\n|Print article||This entry was posted by Glen on August 6, 2010 at 10:55 am, and is filed under Blog, Learned the Hard Way.

Glenstone Ave., Springfield, Mo., 65802).\nThe public is invited to this free event that will unite Christians in faith and business communities together in strategic conversation. RSVP for the lunch, dinner or both to Susan Meamber (email@example.com, (417) 268-1010).\nThe economic uncertainty, moral confusion and spiritual hunger of our day call for dialogue among thoughtful people across diverse domains. In the past two decades, there has been intense interest and significant progress in the integration of ethics and economics, business and mission, with clerical and lay leaders finding new places of partnership.\nThoughtful Christian leaders realize that evangelization and church planting/revitalization require fresh strategies as we confront challenges of cultural diversity, religious competition and skepticism and unprecedented social needs. The good news is that biblical faith and the empowerment of the Spirit provide the resources for local churches and communities to flourish as expressions of the kingdom of God. In order to realize this vision, church leaders, along with business, educational, social service and cultural leaders need to engage in serious conversations about issues so important to all of us as followers of Jesus.\nThe Assemblies of God Theological Seminary is dedicated to educating servant-leaders who are led by the Spirit for today's Church.\nThe Acton Institute is dedicated to the integration of Judeo-Christian truths with free market principles and supports efforts of Christians from all traditions that enable the advancement of the Mission of God and human flourishing.\nThe host for this event will be Dr. Charlie Self, the director of the Ph.D. in Bible and Theology and associate professor of church history at AGTS. He is also a senior advisor for the Acton Institute, tasked with mobilizing leaders to deep thought and decisive action. His new book (pictured above), published by Acton, represents a clarion call to Spirit-empowered discipleship that integrates faith, work and economics.\nSchedule (These sessions will be recorded and video posted to the AGTS website after the event.)\nNoon-1:30 p.m.: Lunch and Keynote Addresses\n2-3:30 p.m.: Panel Discussion, \"Toward Integration of Faith, Work and Economics\"\n5:30-7:30 p.m.: Dinner and Keynote Address\nFor more information contact Charlie Self (firstname.lastname@example.org, 417-268-1077).

{"text": "At least initially, most Master Gardener activities center around the Extension Service office. The first 20 volunteer service hours are spent there. This is in fact a continuation of the training so the new volunteers can become familiar with the office, its personnel and resources, and so the Extension Service faculty and staff can become familiar with their new volunteer assistants. The remaining service hours are spent in a wide variety of activities, which are related to some aspect of gardening and contribute to community education and service. Many Master Gardeners continue their association with the office by answering telephones during Plant Clinic hours, mailing out brochures in response to requests, developing demonstration gardens, or working with 4-H leaders and youth of Collier County. Master Gardeners can also participate in the Florida Yards and Neighborhoods program as Yard Advisors.\nOther activities include, but are not limited to, plant clinics in other areas of the county, manning information booths at fairs and shows, and preparing informational brochures. There is something for almost every skill at every level. Many Master Gardeners far surpass the mandatory 75 volunteer service hours, with some volunteering several hundred hours in a year.\nTraining never ceases for the certified and working Master Gardener. Programming and field visits are scheduled for Master Gardeners to boost their horticultural understanding. Specialized knowledge is gained to better enable the Master Gardener to give expert advice. Outings are also used for planning and exchanging information on various projects.\nOnce a year the University of Florida conducts \"post graduate\" Master Gardener training at the State Master Gardener Conference. This is a voluntary, two-three day conference that Master Gardeners attend to receive training and meet other Master Gardeners from throughout the state.\nPara la traduccíon al español, escoja la bandera española arriba.\nEl servicio tradutor utilizado aqui puede hacerle publicidad a una variedad de bienes o servicios.

{"text": "Colombia Hostage Rescue Endangers Lives of Journalists and Aid Workers\nAmidst all the joy and celebration resulting from the Colombian military’s successful rescue of 15 hostages last week, the fact that the tactics utilized in the mission will likely endanger the lives of journalists and aid workers in the future has been completely ignored. By having soldiers pose as journalists and aid workers in order to gain access to the hostages, the Colombian government has increased the already high risks faced by legitimate reporters and NGO workers. In a country that is already one of the most dangerous places in the world in which to work as a journalist or a defender of human rights, the armed actors will now be even more suspicious of anyone claiming to work in those fields.\nLast week’s rescue mission — assuming it did occur as the Colombian government claims and that a ransom was not paid to secure the release of the hostages — was not the first time that the Uribe administration has used the strategy of disguising state security forces as journalists to gain access to hostages. Only last month, a grenade-toting former soldier took 19 people hostage in the government’s pension office in the Colombian capital, Bogotá. The hostage-taker allowed reporters and camera crews to enter the building so he could publicly state his demands that he be paid a pension for his two decades of military service. Undercover police officers posed as journalists in order to gain access to the building and then successfully subdued the man and freed the hostages.\nThe tactics used last week to rescue the 15 hostages — including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt and three US military contractors — held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) mimicked that earlier operation. The rescue mission also replicated many aspects of a humanitarian operation conducted by the Venezuelan government three months ago that secured the release of four hostages held by the FARC. Participants in that operation included legitimate journalists and NGO workers who arrived at the remote rendezvous point in an unmarked helicopter to receive the released hostages.\nAccording to General Fredy Padilla de Leon, commander of the Colombian army, the soldiers who participated in last week’s rescue operation took acting classes for a week and a half to learn how to impersonate, not only guerrillas, but also journalists and aid workers. After convincing the guerrilla in charge of the hostages that his captives were to be transported to where the FARC’s supreme commander Alfonso Cano was located, the soldiers arrived at the rendezvous point in two white helicopters devoid of markings. Four of the soldiers on board were disguised as aid workers and two others impersonated a television journalist and cameraman in order to convince the rebels that a fictional NGO was helping to coordinate a prisoner exchange.\nThe tactics used by the Colombian government will undoubtedly increase the risks faced by journalists and NGO workers who operate in the country’s rural conflict zones. Colombia’s armed groups, particularly the FARC, will now be even more distrustful of anyone who claims to be a reporter or aid worker. This is likely of little concern to Colombia’s President Alvaro Uribe, who has repeatedly endangered the lives of human rights defenders critical of his security policies by accusing them of being spokespersons for the guerrillas. On one prime time national television broadcast in 2003, Uribe accused the country’s NGOs of “politicking at the service of terrorism.”\nHaving worked for years in Colombia’s rural conflict zones, I have been detained on several occasions by FARC guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries who have accused me of being an informer for the Colombian military. In a country that is among the world’s leaders in the number of journalists assassinated, such moments are tense and nerve-wracking. Sometimes, it wasn’t easy to convince the armed groups that I was indeed a legitimate journalist and not an informer.\nBecause of the tactics used in last week’s rescue operation, there is no telling how the FARC might respond to the next legitimate journalist who enters a region under the rebel group’s control. Or how the guerrillas will react in the future when a genuine medical boat belonging to the International Red Cross gets stopped at a rebel checkpoint on a remote jungle river. So while the world is awash in joy over the liberation of the 15 hostages, people should take a moment to reflect on the possibility that journalists and aid workers might be killed in the future because of the irresponsible tactics used by the Uribe administration.", "id": "<urn:uuid:63bbeccf-c655-4f9a-9f97-888978e77662>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://colombiajournal.org/colombia-hostage-rescue-endangers-lives-of-journalists-and-aid-workers.htm", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:41Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9622494578361511, "token_count": 923, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "decided to revisit Interstuhl, one of our favorite furniture design companies, touching on what we’ve considered to be the absolute pinnacle of industrial design perfection. Honestly though, what can I say that Christy hasn’t already covered previously?\nIn this particular post, I want to curate specifically, the White Silver Chair from Interstuhl. This mark of beauty and elegance. An absolute masterpiece. I’m almost afraid to mention the price tag (a hefty $5,000.00+ for just one of these chairs… easily). Now you’re probably asking yourself, “why would anyone EVER pay that much for a chair?” Well, beside the obvious fact that no other chair can hold a candle to this (except for maybe the Eames Lounge chair), take into consideration that these chairs are made to order, they’re ergonomic, and they’re made with the absolute best materials. The white one specifically, (my gem, goddess, temptress) is made with a white-silver coat over brushed aluminum. They’re also 98% recyclable, so in a moment of insanity, you decide you don’t want this chair anymore (and I’m not around to take it off your hands), you can rest assured knowing that it can be disassembled and kicked to the curb to be picked up for recycling. The orange seating also comes standard with this one particularly, but if you don’t fancy the orange seating, you can swap it for their other custom colored seating options.\nWell, I think it’s time to wrap this up, as I’m beginning to cry over the realization that I may never own one of these stunning beauties.

They first began their comedy career in high school by winning the state finals of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival’s Class Clowns competition. This brought them onto the main stage of the Melbourne Town Hall to perform for a sell-out crowd. Winning the state finals of the competition again the next year, and once again performing in Melbourne, spurred the brothers to become more serious about their comedy, and after spending a year honing their craft they re-emerged as The Stevenson Experience, becoming National Finalists in Triple J’s Raw Comedy competition, being featured on ABC television, and are now stalwarts of the Canberra Comedy Circuit. The Stevenson Experience were also cast in the Class Clowns Teenage Gala in 2009 at the Melbourne comedy festival, a show specifically targeted at school aged teenagers and a testament to their versatility with audiences. In early 2009 they performed their first solo show to a sellout crowd.\nIn 2010 The Stevenson Experience were a part of the sleeper hit of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Capital Punishment. Capital Punishment took 5 acts from the nations capital and put them right in the thick of one of the biggest comedy festivals in the world. The success of the show was overwhelming, with the show seeing and attendance rate of a staggering 85%!\nIn April 2011 The Stevenson Experience debuted their first solo show, Mission Twinpossible, at the the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. In the dimly lit, upstairs Love Lounge of Tony Starr’s Kitten Club they performed 24 hilarious shows. The Stevenson Experience also took part in Capital Punishment 2. Look out for them at next years festival, where they will be back with an all new show.\nIn October 2011 The Stevenson Experience will be recording their very first live CD at Civic Pub, to be released later in the year. Book your tickets online on the gigs page!\nThe Stevenson Experience has performed on the main stage at the Melbourne Comedy Festival, The Sydney Comedy Store, and the Canberra Street Theatre, and can be frequently found gigging at all Canberra’s comedy venues. The Stevenson Experience has performed with Charlie Pickering, Michael Chamberlain, Wil Anderson, Corrine Grant, Kitty Flanagan, Sammy J, Dave Jory, Bo Burnham, Hannah Gadsby, Sam Simmons, Austen Tayshus, and The Bedroom Philosopher. They have also played corporate gigs for Events Management Australia, The Australian Defence Force Academy and ACTEW AGL.\nJames plays the guitar.\nBenjamin attempts to play the piano.\nTogether they are The Stevenson Experience!", "id": "<urn:uuid:21557221-2ef2-46a3-96ec-2390273a27e0>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://comedyact.com.au/thestevensonexperience", "date": "2013-05-18T05:48:47Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9477137327194214, "token_count": 592, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "It also gives a little more detail regarding what, exactly, might be going on in the film, which has been fraught with rumors over the last week or so, from Famke Janssen’s rumored appearance as Jean Grey to the revelation yesterday that the film will take place following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand.\n“Where this film sits in the universe of the films is after them all,” director James Mangold told the magazine. “Jean Grey is gone, most of the X-Men are disbanded or gone, so there’s a tremendous sense of isolation for him.”\nHe added, ”That’s something that for me was very important, that I land in a very specific place in his timeline. I wanted to be able to tell the story without the burden of handing it off to a film that already exists and having to conform to it. The ideas of immortality reign very heavily in this story and the burden of immortality weighs heavily on Logan. For me that’s such an interesting part of Logan’s character that is nearly impossible to explore if you have a kind of league or team movie.”\nCertainly, that’s understandable–although it’s hard to guess whether the film has always been seen as taking place after everything else, or whether that’s just part of keeping it a “stand-alone movie,” which is what it sounds like Mangold wants and what he and Fox have been telling fans was coming all along. The film will romp through time a bit, taking place partly in World War II and almost entirely outside of any existing X-Men movie continuity, according to the piece…but that doesn’t mean it won’t tie into X-Men: Days of Future Past, the time-traveling, reality-bending sequel to X-Men: First Class.", "id": "<urn:uuid:129aa405-47d9-4fc2-9d8e-d8eb20e88a08>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://comicbook.com/blog/2012/10/26/the-wolverine-director-explains-the-film/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:18:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9571367502212524, "token_count": 395, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Shame Itself #1A comic review article by: Jamil Scalese\nI consider one of the most key traits of a likeable person to be their ability to be self-deprecating. Actually, I think this even more important for an aspiring comedian. People are more likely to laugh with you when they realize you aren't a pompous jerk. I learned that the hard way.\nFrom one type of comic to another, hilarious and humility mixed to success in Marvel's satiric one-shot Shame Itself, a collection of rising talents and their various lampoons of the major company. The most recognizable of the creators is probably Wyatt Cenac, writer and correspondent on the almost always genius The Daily Show, but the roster is stocked full of long time comedy writers from around the entertainment industry. I had no idea what to expect from this type of book. As a regular buyer of Deadpool, I have been a little worried on what Marvel considers funny, and overall, in this age of serious sequential storytelling humor in comics have dwindled off to the occasional one-liner or comically awkward scenario. I will honestly say I was surprised that Shame Itself had me chuckling to the point that I started to look like a bit of a loon at the office.\nThe issue features about different 11 stories, ranging from a straightforward narrative about Reed Richard and Ben Grimm's college reunion to a series of one-pagers questioning the nature of the Marvel Universe. I'm normally all for spoiling the fun for you with my reviews, but I will stay away from detailing too many of the short stories because the absurdity, and appropriateness, of the pieces are bound to make you smile, if not guffaw. The absolute gem of the comic is a flowchart on how to create a major crossover event by Elliot Kalan (also a writer on The Daily Show) and Jacob Chabot (X-Babies). It might be one of the savviest things I've read from the publisher, and it does not hold back in the slightest. As Kalan jokes in his bio on the last page, the two-page spread might seal his fate in working in comics again, but man, what a way to go out.\nThe read had a few notable misses, like a prose story about the X-Men by Michael Kupperman, and a bit of a downer piece in a knock-off of a woman's fashion magazine. However, with any anthology there will always be stars that shine harder than others, and nothing was remarkably bad.\nI'm not so much reviewing this as I am praising it, huh? Well, so be it! I loved this and it was well worth my $3.99. I want this type of thing to be an regular release for Marvel. You hear me Quesada? Huh? Huh? Yeah, that's what I thought.\nAnd get Elliot Kalan on a Deadpool comic!\nJamil Scalese is just like you -- an avid comics fan and lover of sequential art. Residing in Pittsburgh, PA, he is an unapologetic Deadpool fan, lover of the Food Network and proud member of Steelers Nation.", "id": "<urn:uuid:3f91383e-680f-47d2-9733-603d9e7c3c5a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://comicsbulletin.com/reviews/910/shame-itself-1/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:09:04Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9604324698448181, "token_count": 654, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Some of the projects funded include: a center that will train engineering students to assess the energy efficiency of manufacturing facilities; researching methods to recover uranium from seawater; a software tool to help developers identify preferred locations for solar energy farms; and developing sensors to monitor conditions inside a nuclear waste container.\n“It was a great year for the CAES partnership,” said CAES Director Bill Rogers. “The collaborations we have built between the CAES partner institutions and with industry are starting to flourish and result in new research grants and other funding.”\nCAES, which was created in 2005, is a partnership between Idaho National Laboratory and the State of Idaho through its three researcher universities – Boise State University, Idaho State University and University of Idaho.\nThe State of Idaho has contributed $4.8 million over the past three years – $1.6 million annually – to help support university researchers’ involvement in the CAES partnership.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy and Battelle Energy Alliance, the contractor that runs Idaho National Laboratory, also have contributed significantly to the partnership.\nBattelle Energy Alliance recently invested more than $6 million to equip the CAES Microscopy and Characterization Suite (MaCS) with an atom probe and other high-end instruments to advance materials research. The lab also provided CAES with $1.4 million in funding for exploratory research projects.\nFor more information about the CAES partnership, visitwww.caesenergy.org.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0c98509d-89ce-43e8-94fa-c12713e3b0f6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://commerce.idaho.gov/news/2011/10/caes-researchers-earn-18.2-million-provide-significant-return-on-investment-for-idaho.aspx", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9346562027931213, "token_count": 558, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}
