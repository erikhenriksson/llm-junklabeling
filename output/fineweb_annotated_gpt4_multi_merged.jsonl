{"text": "How AP reported in all formats from tornado-stricken regionsMarch 8, 2012\nWhen the first serious bout of tornadoes of 2012 blew through middle America in the middle of the night, they touched down in places hours from any AP bureau. Our closest video journalist was Chicago-based Robert Ray, who dropped his plans to travel to Georgia for Super Tuesday, booked several flights to the cities closest to the strikes and headed for the airport. He’d decide once there which flight to take.\nHe never got on board a plane. Instead, he ended up driving toward Harrisburg, Ill., where initial reports suggested a town was destroyed. That decision turned out to be a lucky break for the AP. Twice.\nRay was among the first journalists to arrive and he confirmed those reports -- in all formats. He shot powerful video, put victims on the phone with AP Radio and played back sound to an editor who transcribed the interviews and put the material on text wires. He then walked around the devastation with the Central Regional Desk on the line, talking to victims with the phone held so close that editors could transcribe his interviews in real time.\nRay also made a dramatic image of a young girl who found a man’s prosthetic leg in the rubble, propped it up next to her destroyed home and spray-painted an impromptu sign: “Found leg. Seriously.”\nThe following day, he was back on the road and headed for Georgia and a Super Tuesday date with Newt Gingrich’s campaign. The drive would take him through a stretch of the South that forecasters expected would suffer another wave of tornadoes.\nTo prevent running into THAT storm, Ray used his iPhone to monitor Doppler radar, zooming in on extreme cells and using Google maps to direct himself to safe routes. And then the journalist took over again.\n“When weather like that occurs, a reporter must seize the opportunity to get the news out and allow people to see, hear and read the power of nature so that they can take proper shelter,” Ray says.\nSo Ray now started to use his phone to follow the storms. He attached a small GoPro camera to his steering wheel in case a tornado dropped down in front of the car somewhere, and took video of heavy rain and hail with his iPhone. Soon, he spotted a tornado and the chase was on. He followed an unmarked emergency vehicle to Cleveland, Tenn., where he was first on the scene of the storm's aftermath.\nAgain, the tornadoes had struck in locations that were hours from the nearest AP bureau. Damage and debris, as well as a wickedly violent storm that made travel dangerous, slowed our efforts to get to the news. That wasn’t a problem in Tennessee, where our customers were well served by an all-formats report that included this text story.\n“CLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) _ Fierce wind, hail and rain lashed Tennessee for the second time in three days, and at least 15 people were hospitalized Friday in the Chattanooga area.”\nThe byline? Robert Ray.\nFor being adept with technology, chasing after news as it literally dropped from the sky and setting a standard for all-formats reporting that put the AP ahead on the most competitive news story of the day, Ray wins this week’s $300 Best of the States prize.\n© 2013 The Associated Press.

{"text": "Did you know you have two little yellow, nine-volt-battery-sized adrenal glands in your body, just chilling out, maxin’, relaxin’ all cool on top of your kidneys? Someone told me this and I checked it out. Turns out it’s true.\nIt seems as though your adrenal glands are kind of like those British Royal Guards with the big, black fuzzy hats who stand like statues in front of Buckingham Palace. They just stand there quietly, not doing much really, just enjoying the brown, slippery beach that is your kidneys.\nHowever, if anything startling should happen that requires your attention — like say you’re about to give a speech at a wedding or your hear a twig crack outside your tent or your doorbell rings in the middle of the night — then they leap into action, jumping out of their peaceful slumber to squeeze out a big dose of adrenaline right into your body, pumping you up, and turning you into a primal, warrior-like version of yourself.\nWhen tension runs high and adrenaline is secreted into your body some crazy things can happen — sometimes called the fight-or-flight response:\n- Your heart rate increases. And specifically, your body starts sending blood to all your big muscles and diverts it away from “non-critical” parts of your body, like your brain, immune system, and digestive system. I guess someone figured you could digest the sandwich after you killed the bear.\n- Your pupils dilate and you get tunnel vision. Quite literally, adrenaline also reduces your peripheral vision, which together with your big, wide pupils helps you focus on what lies ahead. You can’t quite see through walls, but if a crow is diving at your eyes you might be able to swat it away better.\n- Your body gets ready to boot it. In addition to the rising heart rate, your body starts turning lots more stuff into sugar, raising your blood sugar level and filling you with energy. You might not even feel pain as easily, so the raspberry bushes that shred your legs when you’re running out of the forest won’t slow you down.\nBut what’s also great about adrenalin is that, first of all, you don’t have to control it. It just sort of kicks it into high gear when it figures you could use a boost. I think it’s kind of cool knowing that your body will help you out when you need it most. Punch me in the face and suddenly my internal British Royal Guard tosses away his fuzzy, black cap, cracks his neck, and rolls up his sleeves.\nAnd really, isn’t it that little dose of adrenalin that helps you do a better job when you need it most? It’s a natural upper, helping you nail the big speech, ace the final exam, or perhaps flee both of those scenes.\nThere’s a reason some people become adrenaline junkies. The boost you get from your adrenal glands waking up and getting out of bed is intoxicating. Sure, it fuzzes up your thinking a bit and sends your intestines on sabbatical, but it sure does pump you up. And remember: when something important in your life is about to happen, you can count on your good pal adrenaline to be there, juicing you up, helping you fight the good fight.\nJian Ghomeshi is the host of my favorite radio show. It’s called Q and broadcasts across North America every morning. Jian is a big friend and fan of 1000 Awesome Things and The Book of Awesome and I’m really excited because he just released his first book. It’s called 1982 and is a beautifully written memoir about growing up in the suburbs of Toronto and trying to fit in. (My kind of book!) For those of you who love reading, I think he’s a fantastic writer and am really excited to recommend this book.", "id": "<urn:uuid:803e14c3-dc2e-43d6-b75d-6fb3981c4fe6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://1000awesomethings.com/2012/09/24/934-adrenaline/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:11:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9479914307594299, "token_count": 821, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Five Reasons I Love Boston\n1. The water.\nThe Atlantic Ocean, as deep and true as denim, so blue it melts into the sky, horizonless. And the Charles River. Years from now, I’ll remember riding the Red Line from Boston into Cambridge at night – the way the lights streak across the black water like crayons lined up in a box.\nAfter my childhood in Seattle to my college years in Boston, I don’t think I could live anywhere but a coast.\n2. The seasons.\nI always come back to school right at the tail end of summer. Heat sinks into the subway stations like poisonous gas, and whatever you wear, it’s too much fabric. With October right around the corner, though, fall settles in. I love the way golden light fans out from behind buildings and through alleyways. Yellow leaves get stuck in the rain currents along the sidewalk. It’s my favorite time of year.\nBoston has also taught me the true meaning of winter. Winter is wet hair freezing solid on the way to class, two pairs of socks, ears tucked into scarves. Torrential flurries of snowflakes that burn skin. Frankly, winter is miserable.\nBut then there’s that one morning – and it’s always a morning, and you’re never quite prepared for it – when you step outside and every tree in Boston has bloomed. Cherry blossoms opened like pale pink popcorn, blue skies, tender green leaves. It’s such a miracle that this can happen despite the sheets of ice and crazy wind tunnels, it makes everything worthwhile.\n3. The quirkiness.\nI love the farmer’s markets all over the city, the narrow brick alleys begging to be explored, the late night restaurants in Chinatown. Boston constantly surprises me. Today I discovered the food trucks – why didn’t I know that Boston has food trucks??\n4. The history.\nA handful of the founding fathers are buried mere blocks from campus. I walk through the oldest park in America to get to my boyfriend D-’s apartment in Beacon Hill, a neighborhood of gas lamps and weathered brick. Everywhere you look, historic churches stand between skyscrapers. The contrast is astonishing.\n5. These amazing people.\nSure, most of them aren’t from Boston. A-’s from Colorado, C-’s from LA, and S- is all the way from Guam. But nine months of the year, they’re all mine. They make Boston feel like home.\nWhy do you love _______?", "id": "<urn:uuid:64f968bf-14bc-48bd-a1bb-a43b3f4a3c3d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://17andbaking.com/2012/09/30/five-reasons-i-love-boston/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=fd9f0e7c6a", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9266799688339233, "token_count": 550, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "TRIBE CHIEF TRIS DAZZLES AT DISH, FLUBS IN FIELD IN SIXTH STRAIGHT TIGER WIN\nBy Calvin J. Butterworth\nJune 19, 1924\nTy Cobb can tell you. Personally causing your team's loss when you are managing said team can be a devastating turn of events. Players who look to you for leadership and support are left in a rudderless abyss and often need to find dry morning land on their own.\nSuch was the case at Navin Field today, as the suddenly resurgent Indians re-visited our neighborhood, fresh from taking three of four from the Yankees and before that, four straight from Boston. It was their misfortune, though, to run into the Earl of Whitehill, who has been spinning masterpieces of hurling lately. Skipper Speaker doubled off him with two outs in the 1st, but Riggs Stephenson, back from an ailment, left him there with a short fly. Joe Sewell and Speaker singled with two outs again two innings later, but this time Riggs grounded out.\nMeanwhile Harry Heilman, hero of yesterday, was stranding runners aplenty for our side, failing after three straight Fred Haney hits off Joe Shaute. The game remained scoreless through the first six frames, a remarkable achievement when one considers the power of these clubs' collective clout.\nWith one out in the Tiger 7th, though, Frank O'Rourke reached on his third single. Whitehill then lofted a fly straight out to Speaker. The sun had been playing peek-and-seek all afternoon behind thin clouds, and as the ball reached its pinnacle it was evident Tris was having trouble locating it. Sure enough, he threw up his mitt at the last moment and was as stunned as the thousands of witnesses were to have it nick off the top and bound insanely toward the deep fence. By the time he tracked down the sphere, O'Rourke had scampered home and Whitehill was standing on third base. Shaute was visibly unnerved, threw a muffin-ball to Rigney, and Topper rammed it into the corner for a double and 2-0 lead!\nEgg still dripping down his face, Speaker singled with one out in the 8th, Stephenson followed with one of his own, but the Earl induced a twin killing off the bat of George Burns to end the threat. Another minor disturbance went by the wayside in the 9th, Whitehill had his tidy 10-hit shutout, and Detroit had won six games in a row.\nCobb was thrilled later about the result. \"Home runs? Who needs 'em? We got more line hits in our bureau than a buccaneer's got dubloons in the sand.\" Someone mentioned the error by Speaker was a lucky break and Cobb froze the reporter with a baleful stare before ducking into the nearest shower stall.\nCLE 000 000 000 - 0 10 1\nDET 000 000 20x - 2 8 0\nOnly other American League game today:\nat BROWNS 10-14-0, WHITE SOX 8-10-2\nOne of the more thrilling spectacles of this or any year, and no one expected it. The Chicagos have had their way with St. Louis all season, and with Sloppy Thurston staked to a 6-2 after three on the horrific Ray Kolp, Brownie fans were already making their dinner plans. It was actually 8-2 in the last of the 6th when four Browns singles and a key flub from Bill Barrett gave St. Louis four runs and put them back in the contest. A Pat Collins single in the 8th pulled them to 8-7, as great relief twirling from George Grant and Hub Pruett kept matters close. But after Tobin and pinch-hitter Severeid both singled to begin the last of the 9th, up stepped famous batsman George Sisler. He picked out a Thurston curve, swung mightily and cracked it on a magnificent arc out to right. Hooper gave chase but ran out of room as the ball dropped into the Sportsman Park pavilion amidst a gaggle of celebrating fans.\nWashington will be in Shibe Park tomorrow, now with a 2-game advantage, while the Red Sox will take their losing streak into Yankee Stadium.\n|AMERICAN LEAGUE through Thursday, June 19|\n|Chicago White Sox||38||25||.603||2|\n|New York Yankees||31||31||.500||8.5|\n|St. Louis Browns||27||36||.429||13|\n|Boston Red Sox||24||37||.393||15|", "id": "<urn:uuid:2c08e1d4-9706-41d8-84dc-ee2939758c81>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://1924andyouarethere.blogspot.com/2009_07_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:54:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9647520184516907, "token_count": 979, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured"]}
{"text": "|Tommy Pi - Trance Experience|\n|Written by Paul|\nTommy Pi started DJing at small private parties at the age of 13. He was always into music, so it was no surprise when he went on and bought his first equipment, some Omnictronic Turntables and a small Gemini mixer. From that day on he always used any chance he got to play at parties, and it wasn't long before his day would come, for him play on a big stage in front of more than 50 people! There was a big party in his home town of Minden (North Germany) with DJ's like Monika Kruse, Alex Lück and others and Tommy thought that it would be great to play there. So he went straight to the promotor and said 'Hey man, I'm from here, I'm a DJ, too so can I play?'Not thinking that this would ever be possible, the promotor said, 'Ok, just come here tomorrow, and you can play for an hour'. That was the birth of DJ Tommy Pi.\nFrom then on, Tommy played in clubs like PW1 in Porta Westfalica, or Go!Parc in Herford. He also played the Go!Parc on Tour Events alongside Alex Lück and others. The biggest day was yet to come! On 21st of October 2000 Tommy and his mate Dee-B had the chance to play alongside Piet Blank at the Einslive Party in Minden, invited by Piet himself. It was a big party and Tommy was very nervous and shaking as he put the needle on the vinyl for the first record 'DJ Culture'. He played on that evening and the crowd were fantastic and it was a lot of fun for both, Tommy and Dennis.\nThe crowning Glory for Tommy was in 2002 when he was voted as 'Best DJ' by the local magazine 'Stadtgeflüster'. Tommy was the second DJ to win this trophy, after Timo Maas won it the year before.\nIn 2003 Tommy started his weekly Radio Show 'Trance Experience' on PureDJ. The show is streamed every Monday from 8-10 pm CET. Now, 1Mix is rebroadcasting the show from October 2008 Tuesdays from 4-6pm.\nIn February 2005 Tommy's second Radio Show 'Trance Experience ETN Edition' was started on ETN.fm as a monthly one-hour radio show.\nAll of Tommy's mixes and Radio Shows are now available as a Podcast on iTunes,podcast.de or mypodcast.com.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7e6216ca-0a01-498d-85f7-7d4aed299c98>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://1mix.co.uk/trance-shows/tommy-pi-trance-experience.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:54:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9856569170951843, "token_count": 527, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Iran’s Wild Card for Defense Stocks In 2012 … Dividends Hang in the Balance (ATK, GD, LLL, LMT, RTN)December 28, 2011 by Jon C. Ogg\nIt is no secret that Iran is a saber-rattling nation. The country wants to be relevant on the global stage so much that it keeps up with its nuclear ambitions regardless of global trading sanctions and regardless of efforts from the Western nations trying to stop it. And now the big news is not the nuclear front, but an Iranian minister claiming that Iran could effectively block the flow of traffic through the Gulf of Hormuz easier than drinking a glass of water.\nIn the age of austerity and military budgets being slashed to deal with deficits, Iran has a chance of turning 2012 accidentally into the year of defense stocks. Alliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK), General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD), L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) could all hang in the balance. With operations all but gone in Iraq and with the trend in Afghanistan being one of leaving, Iran is the obvious wild card.\nIf anything real ever comes out of Iran’s religious political leadership other than how neat it is to stone people over adultery, how it denies that alternative lifestyles exist in Iran, or about how it wants nuclear power for peace, this may end up making the sell-off seen in defense stocks a bargain of the century. If (or when) Iran ever announces that it has built a nuclear bomb, it likely is going to be difficult for Western nations to slash and burn too far on the defense spending. Before running out and loading up on warfare stocks, please remember … this is all “If, Then.”\nAlliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK) trades at $56.15 and the 52-week trading range is $51.26 to $78.17. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $71.70, implying upside of roughly 28%. Alliant Tech currently has a lower dividend yield against peers with only a payout rate of about 1.4% and shares are up about 4% since the Thanksgiving break. Alliant is highly dependent on the business of selling bullets and it no longer has the booster-rocket business from Space Shuttle launches.\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) trades at $66.15 and the 52-week trading range is $53.95 to $78.27. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $76.16, implying upside of about 15%. General Dynamics currently yields about 2.9%.\nL-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL) trades at $66.85 and the 52-week trading range is $58.30 to $88.55. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $71.64, implying upside of only about 7%. L-3 yields about 2.7% in its dividend and shares are up about 5% from the Thanksgiving break.\nLockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) trades at $81.25 and the 52-week trading range is $66.36 to $82.43. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $80.12, implying that the stock is above a full-value price. Its dividend yield is quite high at about 5% and shares are up almost 5% since its $1.00 dividend was reflected in the stock in late November.\nRaytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) trades at $48.50 and the 52-week trading range is $38.35 to $53.12. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $49.53, implying upside of only about 2%. Its dividend yield is currently about 3.7% and shares are up about 14% since the Thanksgiving break.\nUnless something new comes out of North Korea, or unless there is more unrest in the Middle East, Iran is the big worry for the country today. With such high payouts from some defense contractors, it is worth wondering just how high some of the payouts can rise during the proliferation of austerity.\nJON C.

{"text": "In Suzanne Collins’s wildly popular Hunger Games books, children are chosen by lottery to serve as gladiators who fight to the death. The Games are televised for the entertainment of the general population. Collins models her games on ancient Rome, where gladiators fought to the death and slaves were fed to the lions. She even names her dystopian world Panem, after the Latin word for bread, as in bread and circuses, panem et circenses. Bread and circuses refers to the cheap trick of persuading the masses to cheer for a lion or a slave, for one gladiator or another, rather than participating in or observing or acting to change the political arena. Keep the general population fed with the most basic of food and keep their minds off of rebellion with the distractions of entertainment.\nAs I read through Lenore Skenazy’s blog and watched her appearances on various chat shows, I kept thinking, “Bread and circuses.” There is so much air time to fill, so television producers and headline writers make news of the Mommy Wars. Free Range Parenting vs. Helicopter Parenting. Stay-at-home Mothers vs. Working Mothers. Breast vs. Bottle. Sleep Training vs. Attachment Parenting. Blah, blah, blah. In one blogger’s take on the issue, she asks, “Free range parenting versus helicopter parenting: which team are YOU on?” Really? We have to pick teams? These issues are so much more complex than x vs. y, but so much easier to digest if packaged in a familiar us vs. them format.\nIn one clip, Skenazy and another parent appear on Anderson Cooper to replay how Skenazy was able to help this woman who is so much of the helicopter persuasion that in public washrooms she feels it necessary to go right into the bathroom stall with her daughter. “Doesn’t everybody?” this mother quips, when the audience gasps. They feed this woman to the lions, then they rescue her, undo her public shame with a public reformation of her extreme and errant ways.\nUnless it’s extreme, it’s not entertainment, so we have thown up on the screen all kind of wild and wacky folk on reality shows who hoard or dumpster dive for coupons for hundreds of free sticks of deodorant, saving up against Armageddon.\nWhat good does any of this do? Silly distractions from the reality lived in the murky middle ground.\nI respect Skenazy and her husband’s decision to let their son ride the subway alone. I respect her desire to move away from a culture where kids are kept bubble wrapped. I respect her initiative to create a television show that capitalizes on the buzz that her son’s subway ride generated. But I resent the circus atmosphere of telling the stories of bubble wrapped or free range kids.\nWhy do mothers keep feeding each other to the lion of artificially polarized public opinion?", "id": "<urn:uuid:1ac6d51e-62f3-46ac-b505-0adc65876218>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://4mothers1blog.com/2012/04/24/a-big-silly-distraction/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:05Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9376577734947205, "token_count": 620, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "(Fort Worth, TX) On Sunday, March 4th, The 5Choir from Saint Andrew Catholic Church in Fort Worth appeared at the 2012 Spirit Games at Nolan Catholic High School. The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation brought together Fort Worth's Catholic kids of all ages for the fifth annual SPIRIT GAMES, a day of competition and fun. The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation is committed to offering financial aid to local children who seek the strength and values of a Catholic education and to those courageous children and their families whose lives are afflicted with cancer.\nThe 5Choir played and sang for the Mass with Bishop Kevin Vann, and played a short set of songs after Mass. The band covered songs featured on local Christian station KLTY, such as \"Your Grace is Enough\" and \"The Revelation Song\" as well as Catholic favorites like \"Here I Am, Lord\". For the Ordinary of the Mass, they played selections from the new Mass of St. Frances Cabrini by Kevin Keil, director of Liturgy and Music at Holy Cross Catholic Church in The Colony.\nThe members of the 5Choir are: Jed Chatterton, Mike Hyry & John Costlow, guitars; Gerard Bowsher, drums; Brian Benison, bass, keyboards and director; Athena Meyer, flute, keyboard & vocals and David Lyles, Victor Meyer, Honey Rae, Aimee Pietzsch, Peggy Spears, Mark Trance & Kimberly Ward, vocals. Sound at the Spirit Games by Opie Odom.\nAsked about the 2012 Spirit Games, 5Choir director Brian said, \"I was thrilled when Jim Breen, President of The [Stephen Breen Memorial] Foundation called and asked if the 5Choir could play at the Spirit Games. Jim heard us play at the 5PM Mass at Saint Andrew and thought we were a good fit.

I first heard about Bank of America doing this yesterday, but now I’m learning that other banks like Chase and Wells Fargo may be doing it as well. Not that I’m surprised. A lot of national chain banks are starting to have fees for just about everything else you do.\nHere’s what the New York Times said on this:\nBank of America joins banks including SunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells Fargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up to record levels, a recent survey found.\nThe added fees have come even though the limit on the merchant fees wasn’t as low as banks initially had feared.

Which is why it was so surprising when the Canadian man received a letter addressed “To the Estate of George Johannesen.” Even more surprising is that it came from his insurance company, who should really be on top of such things.\nNow this wouldn’t have been so terrible if Manitoba Public Insurance was giving Johannesen’s estate a fat check for his passing away. But that’s not what happened. Instead the letter was to inform the estate that, since George was dead, his driver license and auto insurance had been cancelled in October.\nThis poses a problem for Johannesen because, being alive, he continues to drive his car.\n“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” he told the Toronto Sun. “For me to be declared dead, someone would have to present a death certificate. For someone to get that, I guess I must have died sometime in October.”\nNow the 59-year-old worries that he will stop getting his pension and other government benefits.

Usually, domain experts cannot afford enough time and knowledge to effectively assess and combine both qualitative and quantitative information in these models.Existing approaches can solve only one of two tasks instead of both.We propose a four-step algorithm to integrate multiple probabilistic graphic models, which can effectively update existing models with newly acquired models. In this algorithm, the qualitative part of model integration is performed first, followed by the quantitative combination. We illustrate our method with an example of combining three models. We also identify the factors that may influence the complexity of the integrated model. Accordingly, we identify three factors that may influence the complexity of the integrated model. Accordingly, we present three heuristic methods of target variable ordering generation. Such methods show their feasibility through our experiments and are good in different situations.

A British couple who have spent the past 12 years working as Christian missionaries in the the Gambia have been jailed after being charged with sedition. (British missionaries jailed in Gambia )\nBanjul from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:000000f2.JPG\n3. Scary Tales of Tiny Gambia Being the Headquarters of the Mafia World\nBy Bubacarr Ceesay\nDecember 13, 2005\nThe Gambia is the international limelight again as the center of an international mafia ring.\nIn a masterpiece investigative report, The Wayne Madsen Report unraveled a network of weapons smugglers and mobsters operating in the heart of the Gambian Capital, working hand in hand with the Gambian leader, President Yahya Jammeh.\nIn reference to the Gambia, the report stated thus:\n\"There is also now interest in the activities of Richard T. Hines, the head of the powerful Republican lobbying firm RTH Consulting, Inc.\n\"Hines, a South Carolina native and a protege of the late GOP dirty trickmeister Lee Atwater, was one of the architects of the dirty tricks campaign by Bush against John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary.\n\"A confederate of Abramoff in the 1980s Reagan administration's covert support network for the Nicaraguan contras, Angolan UNITA guerrillas, and Afghan mujaheddin, Hines is active in various Confederacy resurgence organizations, many of which have clear racist agendas.\n\"However, that has not prevented Hines from becoming the lobbyist for Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh, a military officer who overthrew Gambia's democratically-elected President Sir Dawda K. Jawara in a 1994 military coup supported by the United States Navy.\n\"Hines inherited the lobbying contract for Gambia from the eclectic Washington lobbyist Edward von Kloberg III, an individual who represented Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Liberia's Samuel K. Doe, Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Congolese leader Laurent Kabila, the exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda, and Saddam Hussein.\n\"Last May, von Kloberg took a swan dive off of a castle in Rome, allegedly committing suicide after a spat with a gay partner.\n\"The connections between Hines and Gambia are important since the small narrow West African country is also a major base of operations for notorious Russian international arms smuggler Viktor Bout.\n\"The Gambia is the headquarters for one of many of Bout's front companies -- companies that are used to smuggle everything from weapons to diamonds and mercenaries to international relief supplies.\nBout, reportedly in a Bangkok jail since March 2008\n\"In fact, Bout was the character on whom fictional arms smuggler Yuri Orlov, played by Nicolas Cage in the movie Lord of War, was largely based.\n\"Bout's connections with the Christian Right do not end with Gambia.\n\"Bout was Liberian dictator Charles Taylor's primary arms and diamond smuggler.\n\"Bout and his associates were given Liberian diplomatic passports and, with Taylor's blessing and protection, they registered a number of their front companies in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.\n\"Taylor, who is now in exile in Nigeria, was a business partner with Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson.\n\"Robertson's organization mentored both Ralph Reed and Richard Hines.\n\"According to British and Israeli intelligence sources, Taylor also enabled Al Qaeda to launder blood diamonds for cash through Liberia.\n\"Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone were where Israeli mobsters engaged in business with Israeli gangsters who operated under the full protection of the Israeli Likud government.\n\"Before Likud began purging Mossad of experienced intelligence officers with ties to the Israeli Labor Party, the Israeli-Al Qaeda diamond financial connection in West Africa was being pointed out by those officers as suicidal for Israeli interests.\n\"However, Taylor and Bout had powerful interests in the United States: a combination of the Christian Right and pro-Likud organizations like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), both of which ignored and continue to ignore Israeli organized crime connections to Al Qaeda and terrorism.\n\"Robertson and Taylor were business partners in a Cayman Islands front company called Freedom Gold, Ltd.\n\"In fact, Freedom Gold bas headquartered at Robertson's CBN offices in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Robertson's African interests also crossed paths with Bout's in another country -- the former Zaire.\n\"Robertson's African Development Company used the cover of Robertson's tax-exempt \"Operation Blessing\" to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war-ravaged Zaire (now Congo).\n\"A UN Security Council report dated November 30, 2005, lists Bout's Gambia New Millennium Air Company as having its address at the residence of Hines' client Jammeh: State House, Banjul, Gambia.\n\"The UN report states, 'The Director of this firm is Baba Jobe, who is already listed on the Liberia Sanctions Committee's assets freeze list. According to a commercial aviation database, the firm acted as a cover for Victor Bout's operations. Its one aircraft, a Russian-made passenger jet, was acquired from Centrafrican Airlines.'\n\"It is noteworthy that Hines's client, President Jammeh, just took possession of the Russian-made VIP presidential passenger jet, an Ilyushin IL-62 (C5-GNM) [Gambia] (formerly CCCP-86511 [USSR], RA-86511 [Russia], 3D-RTI [Swaziland], TL-ACL [Central African Republic]).\n\"And also of interest is the owner of the presidential aircraft: it is none other than Gambia New Millennium Air, the Bout-owned company listed on the UN Security Council freeze list and which is headquartered at Jammeh's State House in Banjul, the Gambian capital.\n\"In fact, the plane had been previously registered to Bout front companies in Swaziland and the Central African Republic.\n\" Bout, who flew arms and passengers from Dubai and other locations to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan prior to 9-11, is now providing air services in post-Taliban Afghanistan as well as U.S.-occupied Iraq.\n\"Bout's transactions with the Taliban were handled by Vial, Inc., a firm based in Delaware.\n\"One of Bout's closest associates is the Russian-Israeli Odessa-born crime boss Leonid Minin, an Israeli national who, according to the UN Security Council, travels on forged German passports as well as legal Israeli, Russian, Greek, and Bolivian passports under at least ten aliases.\n\"It is also noteworthy that many of Bout's operations are based in Eastern European countries that have been mentioned in association with the rendition and transporting of CIA prisoners.\n\"Bout's numerous Russian-built cargo and passenger planes have been seen at the same airports used by CIA flights.\n\"For example, Bright Aviation, a suspected Bout front, is based at Sofia Airport in Bulgaria.\n\"Bulgaria is believed to be one of the countries used by the CIA to house secret prisoners.\n\"Another Bout front, Moldtransavia SRL, is based in Chisinau, Moldova, another suspected stopover point for CIA flights.\n\"One Chisinau, Moldova-based Bout front company, Aerocom, which also does business as Air Mero, is contracted to fly for Kellogg, Brown & Root in Iraq and elsewhere.\n\"Aerocom has also been cited in UN and DEA reports for being involved in drug smuggling in Belize.\n\"Some law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe believe that the covert flights being operated by CIA contractors and Bout's companies in support of secret prisoner movement are also involved in smuggling drugs.\n\"After being subjected to news reports, Aerocom quickly changed its name last year.\"\nHighly dependable sources in Banjul also informed AllGambian about recent arms purchase by the Jammeh regime from an undisclosed country, amounting to 4.3 million dalasis.\nThis comes at the heels of a hard-hitting border impasse between the Gambia and Senegal.\nThe stand-off almost paralyzed the Gambian economy and caused untold hardship on the average Gambian. Observers wondered how the Gambia gov can afford to spend on presidential jets and military hardware at this junction when the economy is in shambles.", "id": "<urn:uuid:052280ae-4e57-401f-95a0-23a58b01b11a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aangirfan.blogspot.ca/2008/12/gambia-and-organised-crime.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:19:30Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9478747844696045, "token_count": 1848, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Previous abstract Next abstract\nSession 40 - The Interstellar Medium.\nDisplay session, Tuesday, June 09\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) explosions can make kpc-size shells and holes in the interstellar media (ISM) of spiral galaxies if much of the energy heats the local gas to above 10^7 K. Disk blowout is probably the major cause for energy loss in this case, but the momentum acquired during the pressurized expansion phase can be large enough that the bubble still snowplows to a kpc diameter. This differs from the standard model for the origin of such shells by multiple supernovae, which may have problems with radiative cooling, evaporative losses, and disk blow-out. Evidence for giant shells with energies of \\sim10^53 ergs are summarized. Some contain no obvious central star clusters and may be GRB remnants, although sufficiently old clusters would be hard to detect. The expected frequency of GRBs in normal galaxies can account for the number of such shells.\nProgram listing for Tuesday", "id": "<urn:uuid:e2300ad5-01dd-4e80-92b3-7ec88785cc9d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aas.org/archives/BAAS/v30n2/aas192/abs/S040015.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:41Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9126408100128174, "token_count": 208, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Everyone wishes for something. And lots of people believe they know how to make their wishes come true with magical thinking.\nWhat is it? \"Magical thinking is a belief in forms of causation, with no known physical basis,\" said Professor Emily Pronin of Princeton. \"So, for example, there's no known physical basis for how carrying a fluffy pink rabbit's foot in your pocket is going to increase your odds of winning the lottery.\"\nFor magical thinkers, it's more about the power of their wishes, their feelings and their positive thinking to affect their lives directly.\nTwenty-seven-year-old aspiring actress Lindsay Lioz relies on magical thinking to further her showbiz career -- starting with visualizing every audition in advance. \"It makes me feel like I've had rehearsal,\" she said. \"It makes me feel prepared.\"\nLioz also uses magical thinking to improve her love life. She's written a list of the qualities she wants in a man -- and she sleeps with that list under her pillow every night. How has it worked so far? \"I have great men in my life, I do. I'm very happy with how it's working out.\"\nMagical thinkers call that idea \"the law of attraction.\" It's a key element of the bestselling book \"The Secret,\" which has been hailed by Oprah Winfrey and bought by millions worldwide.\n\"'The Secret' is telling people that if you think positive thoughts, positive things will happen, even at a very specific level,\" Pronin said. \"If you visualize getting a parking space, you will get one. If you want to get thin, just stop having fat thoughts.\"\nMagical thinking is not a religion. It's a different kind of faith -- a faith in the power of positive thoughts and feelings. Yet as unscientific as magical thinking sounds, Pronin said studies have shown there are times when it seems to have a real effect: \"There was a study where people in their mid-20s were measured in terms of their optimism,\" she said, \"and then, 50 years later, those who were more optimistic, were actually more likely to still be alive. So it's not always magical to believe that your positive thoughts are having a positive effect.\"\nMagical thinking starts in childhood. At the University of Texas, Professor Jacqui Woolley has examined how children who know the difference between what's real and what's not believe that wishing can cause a penny to appear in what has just been shown to be an empty box. \"We find that, by about the age of 4, most of the kids we test seem to really believe that wishing works,\" said Woolley. \"So that would be an example of magical thinking.\"\nNick Barber spent his childhood wishing for riches, focusing on something his father gave him. \"I was about 8 or 9 when my dad came home and gave me a fake million dollar bill,\" he said. \"And that became something that represented my goals. I've hung on to it every since.\"\nBarber would even sleep with the bill under his mattress. Now, at 27, he runs a multimillion dollar real estate company in Dallas called UMoveFree, and he still has that million dollar bill in his wallet. How did that bill help him get to this point? \"It allowed me to believe in myself at a very young age,\" Barber said, \"not to pay attention to those that said you can't, and to always believe that I can.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:97684525-19c7-48da-a302-c2da701993dd>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3160862&page=1", "date": "2013-05-18T07:15:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9900368452072144, "token_count": 716, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Do you drive a picop? Eat sándwiches de rosbif? Do you still own any cederrones? If these words don't sound familiar to you, that's because yesterday, the Associated Press released their first-ever Spanish language style guide, and set us all straight on the proper usage of some of Español's newest words.\nIn case there's any confusion, picop is AP's official Spanish-language word for what many call a camioneta or pick-up truck, rosbif is their official spelling for \"roast beef\" in Spanish. And cederrón? That means CD-ROM. Duh.\nGathered in the auditorium of the prestigious Columbia Journalism School, some of the leading Spanish-language journalists sat down on Monday evening to discuss the finer points of the \"language of Cervantes\" and the AP stylebook -- which they describe as the \"journalist's bible.\" Debate over the AP's continued use of term \"illegal immigrant\" dominated much of the event. But the most lively part of the evening was the presentation of words with roots in modern-day English -- or \"estadunidismos,\" as the new Stylebook calls them.\nIf the Spanish-language style guide is to be our bible, then Monday evening's Moses was surely Argentine journalist Jorge Ignacio Covarrubias who has worked with the AP for more than 40 years and helped put together the new stylebook. The white-haired Covarrubias handed down to us such words as zapeo for channel surfing, cibersitio for website, pipermín for peppermint, ofimática for computer system for office management (like Word), and vermú for vermouth -- all in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. (Can we please call it a Powerrpoín?)\nBut not all Spanglish words are fair game, according to Covarrubias. For example, the AP recommends against using parada to mean parade. The word \"parada\" has historically been used to mean \"stop\", but many modern-day Spanish speakers have started using it to also mean parade. The AP suggests that writers instead use \"desfile.\"\nMany regionalisms are also discouraged. Autobús is the preferred term for bus, although some countries use guagua and others say colectivo. But, after lengthy discussion of the Spanish word for \"drinking straw,\" (pajita vs. popote vs. canuto), no consensus has yet been reached, said Covarrubias.\nNot everybody was happy about all of the AP's decisions. Laura Martínez, a bilingual blogger who writes about Hispanic media, tweeted \"Cervantes is probably revolcándose en la tumba tras escuchar el tema ése del \"cederrón\",\" which translates to \"Cervantes is probably turning over in his grave after hearing the thing about the 'cederrón'\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:cd3169e8-c0b9-4e0a-9e29-ee6c8330ed11>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/ap-spanish-language-stylebook-introduces-technical-spanglish/story?id=17769035", "date": "2013-05-18T06:21:24Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9210053086280823, "token_count": 619, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Nine people in South Korea have committed suicide in three separate incidents within two days. The latest was a 72-year-old man who hanged himself at a construction site in Hoengseong, Kangwon Province, Thursday, police said.\nFour women and one man -- in their 20s and 30s -- were found dead Wednesday in Hwaseong, just south of Seoul, after sealing a passenger car with plastics sheets and inhaling toxic fumes from burned coal briquettes.\nThey left suicide notes saying, \"I have no more hope and no more dreams\" and \"please find my identification card in my back pocket.\"\nPolice were investigating their motive but assumed that the man recruited the four women on the Internet to participate in a group suicide.\nEarlier in another city east of Seoul, Chuncheon, three men in their 20s were also found dead at a private room-for-rent lodge using the same method and sealing the door and windows with dark masking tape from inside the room they were sharing.\nPolice assumed that they, too, were driven by group suicide pacts cultivated online.\nSuch news is common here where the suicide rate is the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of developed countries.\nAn average of 35.1 people killed themselves everyday in 2008, according to the health ministry. That's 24.3 for every 100,000 South Koreans, followed by 21 in Hungary, 19.4 in Japan, 16.7 in Finland and 15.8 in Belgium.\nThe National Statistics Office reported that the suicides are related to the economic downturn, as well as rapid social change within the family and the community.\nKorean society in recent years has been plagued by continuous cases of suicide among celebrities, high-profile politicians and businessmen, teenagers and the elderly. Analysts say the most common cause is depression stemming from social and academic pressures or family troubles.\n\"There's a huge gap in this country because the speed of materialism spreading is much faster than the speed of cultural maturity that must grow together. It all comes from stress of rapid modernization,\" said Jeung Taek-Hee, an expert and consultant at Lifeline Korea.\nKorean parents are having fewer children -- on average one per couple -- and more women are going into the workforce, which leaves the child alone. Although some corporations and government ministries are campaigning for workers to go home by 6 o'clock at least once a month to spend family time, Korean corporate culture still requires employees to participate in work-related dinners and stay late hours.\n\"Naturally, these busy parents end up spoiling the child who ends up self-centered and incapable of dealing with competition,\" Jeung said. \"But the reality is that this society is very, very competitive.\"\nAlong with the miraculous rate of economic growth in the past decades, many South Koreans have become driven by materialism that has been passed on to their kids, Jeung said.\nHe noted that most of the people who commit suicide, especially the young teenagers, find themselves dangerously distressed by not being able to keep up with others materialistically and eventually become anti-social.\n\"The easiest place where they can meet friends who share the same pain is online through suicide communities or chat sites,\" Jeung said.\nOnce they find each other, they become, \"eternal comrades\" who \"must accompany each other to death,\" he said.\nAccording to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, 28.4 percent of young teenagers committed suicide in 2008 because of \"disturbed family relations,\" mostly the result of parental divorce, 19.6 percent from pessimistic depression and 10.1 percent from academic pressure.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2edc9224-49dc-4ff8-a3a7-e5c117b470e6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-struck-online-suicide-pacts/story?id=10636608", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:24Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9732953906059265, "token_count": 750, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "World leaders from 47 nations convene this week in Washington, D.C., for the Nuclear Security Summit, a gathering that the Obama administration hopes will raise awareness about the threats of nuclear arms getting into the hands of terrorists or \"rogue\" nations.\nPresident Obama said Sunday the goal of the nuclear summit is to discuss the terrorist threat and getting countries to lock down their nuclear weapons in a specific time frame. The Obama administration itself has pledged to try to \"secure all vulnerable materials\" within four years and is hoping the summit will spark a case for preventive action among others.\n\"If there was ever a detonation in New York City or London or Johannesburg, the ramifications economically, politically, and from a security perspective would be devastating,\" Obama said on the eve of the summit. \"And we know that organizations like al Qaeda are in the process of trying to secure a nuclear weapon -- a weapon of mass destruction that they have no compunction of using.\"\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week that the nuclear summit would be the largest of its kind hosted by a U.S. president since the U.N. conference in 1945.\nBut even as Obama brings the issue of nuclear security and disarmament into the spotlight -- first with the release of the new U.S. nuclear policy, and then the U.S.-Russia arms reduction agreement -- he faces significant challenges from two fronts.\nInternationally, U.S. allies such as India, Pakistan and Israel have been resistant to signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, citing national security concerns. The view in many countries is that this week's treaty signing aside, if the United States and Russia -- which together account for 95 percent of the world's nuclear arsenal and material -- cannot cut their nuclear stockpile, why should they be forced to?\n\"No one is willing to step up and say, 'Yea, I'm part of the problem here,\" said former national security official Ivan Oelrich, now vice president of the Strategic Security Program at the Federation of American Scientists. The \"U.S. and Russia have to lead the way in major reductions.\"\nParticipant countries will also likely be looking to the United States for accountability. Henry Sokolsi, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, argues that if the United States is going to try to persuade other countries, it needs to shift its own policy at home too.\n\"I just think it's disrespectful to these countries,\" he said. \"Each country has its own problems. If we're not helping them on that, how can we expect them to not rely on them [nuclear weapons] to feel secure? We rely on them. Why should they be any different?\"\nDomestically, the partisan rift on Capitol Hill means possibly a tough fight ahead for Obama's nuclear agenda. Critics of the new nuclear policy released last week complain that it gives a free pass to countries such as Iran and North Korea, and Republican senators are already taking aim at the U.S.-Russia arms treaty that was signed last week, saying it hurts U.S. security interests.\nThe general consensus is that the treaty will eventually be ratified by the end of the year, but the issue is likely to be the subject of a heated political debate for much longer.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0a9b45ec-f8f1-41fa-82b8-42fdadb3c33f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-nuclear-security-summit-symbolic-gesture/story?id=10335607", "date": "2013-05-18T05:50:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9573078751564026, "token_count": 671, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Six days after boarding the \"Good Morning America\" Whistle-Stop '08 Tour train, and beginning the adventure of a lifetime, it's over.\nWe just wrapped the last show of our little Odyssey from the Newseum in the nation's capitol, Washington D.C., and for me, it was an appropriate but bittersweet ending to our tale.\nAppropriate because the point of our tour was to go out and ask real people what was on their minds, to hear straight from them their concerns about our nation. By ending in Washington, D.C., we brought their thoughts, problems and hopes to the doorstep of the government -- to the people that can do something about them.\nBut it was also bittersweet because I honestly didn't want the trip to end.\nI'm not going to lie to you and say that I loved everything about it (3:00 AM wake up calls being the main offender), but I was consistently surprised to find that even in the tougher times, when we had been blearily working for 18 hours straight, something or someone would come along to pick everyone up.\nFrom the absolute chaos of pre-show preparations, to the fleeting sparkle of pride in the production team's eyes when a show went just as planned, life on the train was crazy, grueling and complicated, but most of all, fun.\nSome moments I'll never forget.\nLike the celebration in Massachusetts after we pulled off what had never been done before -- the first live network television broadcast from a moving train.\nOr when Diane, Robin and Chris teamed up -- using Rick Klein and me as props -- to convince Sam that he was supposed to share his tiny room on the train with two roomates.\nOr when Chris put his life on a very secure line at Niagara Falls to dramatically bring the news from the brink of watery doom.\nOr, my personal favorite moment, when Sam, Chris and two producers played the most ridiculous game of Monopoly I've ever seen for four hours and a few of us, Sam included, cried from laughing so hard.\nBut far more moving than the obvious and endearing camaraderie between the anchors was their care for the American people to whom they bring the news every morning.\nNever was this more obvious than yesterday, when I accidentally stumbled into an anchors' meeting where they discuss the content of the next day's show and, for some reason, I was allowed to stay.\nAs an aspiring journalist myself, I can't express how inspiring it was to listen in on this discussion and know firsthand that whatever goes on the air, it's the fairest, most accurate and most informative report possible. Though they have their fun, when it comes to the news Diane, Robin, Chris and Sam are professionals in every sense of the word.\nBut now I have to go -- have to return to \"normal\" life, and I don't want to.\nI have to shave my rail-beard, the result of a production-wide pact to not shave for the duration of the trip.

{"text": "Recently I've been taking a deep dive into the Reactive Extensions for .NET. This is a wonderful project that comes out of Cloud Programmability Division at Microsoft. Rx helps do to really wonderful things with asynchronous and parallel programming in unreliable distributed world. Do you remember what LINQ did to the collections (and much more)? Well, Rx is going to do (and doing) the same to events, asynchronous and distributed programming.\nSo if you have to deal anything that requires more than a single thread, process or machine to run - you'll be impacted in some way or the other.\nThe thing I love the most about what Eric Meijer and his team are doing - the underlying logic which is simple plain and so beautiful. Even the entire IObservable/IObserver thing could be logically derived from IEnumerable by inverting the concepts logically.\nJust watch these videos, if you are interested in the details here (highly recommended):\nWhat does this have to do with CQRS, Domain-Driven Design and Event Sourcing?\nWhen I'm building some complex interactions and systems, I'm trying to follow the same principle. System design and evolution are not guided by the intuition or creativity. Pure logic and mathematical reason are the most reliable advisors here (it feels like proving a theorem). It's really hard to explain in words, but logically solid design can handle a lot of things with really little effort (and code) just because of it's nature. Basically it allows to say to new challenges: \"we did not code for this, but since this is logical, it already is in the design, you just need to enable this\".\nWhile I'm just learning CQRS/DDD/ES I want to do it in the logical way that will prevent me from doing bad and illogical things (which will impact my systems later in their lifecycle). Way of thinking that Eric Meijer shows, seems to help here. Besides, it helps to merge the ideas of Pat Helland (almost infinitely scalable systems) into the overall CQRS concepts.\nReactive Extensions benefit a lot from the marble diagrams representing parallel processes and their interactions. So I've tried to re-apply these principles to my understanding of CQRS/DDD/ES. By mechanically reflecting the logic, here's what I've got for the command handler:\nEssentially this picture reflects the flow of commands (marked with D for Do) incoming into the handler. Commands can come as a single or as a batch (that's the marble or tick in this reality). Commands coming together either succeed or fail together.\nEach incoming tick translates into a new parallel reality for an aggregate (just like SelectMany in Rx, where you get observable of observable of T). Then we flatten successful commands onto the change stream (each change is a unit of work), while errors are flattened into the failure stream.\nThere is a message dispatcher that catches up upon these streams and sends domain events, command failures and confirmations back to the message bus. This way subscribers will have logically complete information about what's happened in the business logic. Subscribers could include sagas and event handlers working with read models (which will be used to provide clients with feedback that includes potential command failures).\nNote a few differences upon the traditional CQRS with event sourcing approach as advocated by Greg Young:\n- Aggregate Root can react to incoming commands by providing a finite stream of events, optionally terminating with error (there is a direct translation from Rx observers here: OnError and OnComplete).\n- We save successful change (command(s) and resulting events) atomically as unit of work. Persisting commands will actually let us ensure command idempotency in the cruel world of scalable message queues (with \"at least once\" deliveries). Essentially this is reflection of Helland's activities that we need to have in the same scope with the aggregates that own them.\n- Command failures are also saved (although the stream could be different from the event source). We don't need to save the intermediate events though - just command(s) and the resulting failure.\n- Message dispatcher runs upon the failure and change streams, publishing domain events into the message bus. We have logically complete information here, that could eventually be provided for the client (sender) for the retrieval.\n- theoretically we can easily process commands for a single aggregate in multiple threads, serializing access to the change and failure streams.\nThings that do not fit in, yet:\n- In CQRS practice there are cases, when there would traditionally be a call to the domain service (in the command handler and before the aggregate root). This does not fit in here. In a Rx world this would probably be a separate async command handler. Yet this would require an additional layer of translation (another command handler and event handler).\n- events and commands are some sort of duals. They are both messages that bring along different intent and help to organize CQRS architecture (this comes from the DDD realm). Yet, this duality (and the rules coming out of it) brings additional complexity, when you need to chain multiple operations (first call unreliable operation, then pass the result to the aggregate, then do something else). I think I'm missing some aspect of commands and events that would help to lay out interactions in a clean and logical way.\nThat's a theory and logic as I see them today. This means:\n- tomorrow perception might evolve into something different that better brings together known patterns and constraints.\n- in theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice - there is a difference.\nIf I could bring in sagas, view event handlers and domain services into the picture in a logical way (and without breaking any existing scalability and consistency constraints), I'd be a happy man.\nWe'll see how it goes (see xLim 4: CQRS in Cloud series for any latest materials on this topic).

{"text": "UK Takeover Code Amendments Come into Effect, Contributed by Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP\nBy Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP\nThe Code Committee of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers has been consulting on proposed changes to the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (City Code) for just over a year. The consultation and resultant changes largely arose following the outcry after Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury and particularly the subsequent closure of Cadbury’s Somerdale factory near Bristol, despite pledges in the offer document to keep the plant open. Originally, the consultation considered far-reaching ideas such as giving different voting rights to long-term and short-term shareholders and increasing the level of ownership required to control a company beyond the traditional 50 percent level.\nAlthough a number of the more radical possibilities were rejected by the Code Committee earlier in the year, the proposed changes, which were initially unveiled in March 20111 and have now been published in final form,2 make a number of changes to the City Code which will affect the way in which takeover offers are effected. The changes are effective from 19 September 2011.\nAs expected, and despite some last minute lobbying, the final amendments largely reflect the Code Committee’s previous conclusions and the draft proposals published earlier this year.\nThe main themes of the changes are:\n- Shifting the balance of power from offerors to target companies;\n- Ending break fees, exclusivity and other deal-protection arrangements;\n- Increasing transparency on advisers’ fees;\n- Holding offerors to account for their statements of intention; and\n- Increasing employee involvement and information in offer processes.\nChanges to the Takeover Code\n— “Virtual Bid” Periods\nThe default requirement in all takeover situations will be that potential offerors must be publicly named and then have a fixed 28-day period to either make their offer or withdraw from the process entirely. The 28-day period may only be extended on the joint application of the offeror and offeree to the Panel. This switches the onus away from the offeree board having to approach the Panel for a “put up or shut up” deadline, in the event an offeror is laying siege to a target for a prolonged period of time without being identified.\nThis new requirement to identify a potential offeror will only apply when an announcement of a potential offer is required, and as a result, potential offerors will be further encouraged to protect the confidentiality of the process for a longer period of time. Potential offerors will not, however, be able to restrict (or attempt to restrict) the offeree from disclosing their identity where there City Code requires that disclosure.\nThe Panel is expected to be receptive to requests to extend the 28-day period, particularly where good reasons can be shown why the process is taking longer. Friendly, recommended offers should therefore be able to proceed on a slightly slower timetable while hostile or unwelcome offerors will be forced to move with much more decisiveness.\nThere is a limited exception from the proposed identification regime and time limits where an offeree announces that it is conducting a formal sale process and seeking one or more potential offerors. The details of the sale process and proposed participants will not then need to be made public. In order to qualify for this exemption, the offeree will need to formally put itself up for sale; traditional “strategic review” announcements, often seen as code for putting themselves up for sale, will not be sufficient.\n— Deal Protection Measures\nDeal protection measures will be completely prohibited except in very limited circumstances. The restriction will apply to “offer-related arrangements,” which are generally defined as “any agreement, arrangement or commitment in connection with an offer” and will apply to currently common arrangements such as:\n- Inducement fee and break fee arrangements;\n- Implementation agreements;\n- Exclusivity arrangements; and\n- “Work-fee” arrangements.\nInducement fees will still be permitted in exceptional circumstances such as where a “white knight” offeror3 makes an offer following the announcement of a hostile offer. The inducement fee will, however, be of limited value as it will only apply if a third competing offeror were to materialise and succeed, not if the original hostile offeror were to succeed.\nAs anticipated, the City Code itself will now contain specific provisions regarding takeovers which are implemented by way of schemes of arrangement to ensure that offeree companies adhere to any timetable and process agreed with the offeror and included in the offer documentation.\n— Disclosure of Fees\nThe estimated fees payable by offerors and offerees will need to be disclosed in offer documents. These will be broken down by category of adviser, with the fee for each of the offeror and offeree and in respect of the offeror’s financing arrangements being split out separately.\nThe new rules address different fee structures, such as success fees, by providing the ability to disclose expected fees and maximum fees so as to protect commercially sensitive information, such as the thresholds at which success fees may kick in. Where the disclosure subsequently proves inadequate, updated information may need to be publicly announced.\n— Increased Disclosure Requirements\nIncreased disclosure about the financing of offers will be required, with copies of the financing documents to be made available on the offeror’s website. Certain commercially sensitive information, such as headroom to increase an offer, may be withheld, as may the structure by which equity is provided to private equity offeror vehicles; a general disclosure as to how much is sourced from each fund will be sufficient.\nSeparately, all-cash offerors need to disclose additional information, putting them on par with offerors offering securities as consideration, though this will not extend to information such as a pro forma balance sheet reflecting the offer and significant change statements since their last audited accounts.\n— Statements as to Future Conduct\nFollowing the public and political criticism following Kraft’s closure of Cadbury’s Somerdale factory, the City Code is being strengthened to try to force more and better disclosure.\nOfferors will be required to include enhanced statements of their intentions for the offeree business and its employees as well as information about the effect of the offer on its own business. They will then be expected to hold to those statements for either any period specified in the statement or, in the absence of any statement, at least 12 months following the offer becoming unconditional. Offerors will only be released from these statements if there has been a material change in circumstances.\nIn order to counter the risk that the new rule will encourage vague and general statements, the Code Committee has stated that an offeror should disclose as fully as possible its commercial rationale for the takeover and that general statements are unlikely to be acceptable where an offeror has had an opportunity to undertake full due diligence.\n— Employee Involvement\nEmployees and employee representatives will have enhanced rights to comment on the effects on employment of a proposed offer and to have their costs in obtaining advice to verify the information contained in their opinion paid for by the offeree company.\nThe Code Committee has stated its view that the costs should be limited to those required to verify the statement by reference to existing sources and not to the provision of general advice as to the opinion or to the commissioning of new research to substantiate an opinion. However, it is likely that there will be debates in the future over the extent of the costs which will be covered, particularly in takeover situations which attract employee and trade union opposition.\nIn addition, offeree companies will be required to publish the opinion of the employees or employee representatives on their websites (and announce having done so) when the opinion is received too late to be included in the offer documentation. Under the old rules, there was no provision requiring this opinion to be published if it was not received in sufficient time to be included within the offer documents.\n— “Virtual Bid” Periods\nWhere an offeree is in an offer period on the implementation date and if it was in talks with or had received an approach from an offeror at the beginning of the offer period, the identity of the potential offeror will need to be announced by 5 p.m. on the implementation date.\nSeparately, any potential offeror identified in an announcement made on or before the implementation date must, by not later than 5 p.m. on the 28th day after the implementation date, either:\n- Announce a firm intention to make an offer;\n- Announce it does not intend to make an offer; or\n- Together with the offeree company, obtain Panel consent to an extension of the deadline.\n— Deal Protection Measures\nInducement fees or other offer-related arrangements entered into before the implementation date will not be subject to the new prohibition.\n— Offer Documents & Offeree Board Circulars\nWhere the offeror publishes the initial offer document before the implementation date, all subsequent offer-related documents must comply with the City Code’s provisions as they were before the implementation date, irrespective of when those documents are published.\n— Employee Involvement\nOfferee companies will be required to publish employee representatives’ opinions on a website and announce having done so with effect from the implementation date, even if the offer document to which the employee representatives’ opinion relates was published before the implementation date.\nDespite the extensive nature of these changes, the Code Committee has already flagged future areas of amendment, such as imposing an ongoing obligation to update material information as it changes, and not only when the next offer-related document is published.\nAlasdair Steele is a corporate partner at Nabarro LLP, specialising in UK and cross-border corporate finance, including public and private M&A, strategic investments and primary and secondary equity issues, as well as regularly advising on consortia and corporate joint venture arrangements, particularly in the infrastructure sector.

{"text": "|HOME SCHEDULE AUTHOR INDEX SUBJECT INDEX|\nPartitioning of carbon, water, and energy fluxes between understory and canopy in a North Central Florida mature uneven aged pine flatwoods forest.\nStarr, Gregory*,1, Powell, Thomas1, Martin, Timothy1, Gholz, Henry1,2, 1 School of Forestry Resources and Conservation, Gainesville, FL2 National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA\nABSTRACT- Of the 5.93 million ha of timberland within the state of Florida, only 19% are maintained under conditions classified as \"natural\" pine forest. While considerable attention has been focused on the carbon and water dynamics of managed pine plantations in the region, little attention has been given to these natural forests, which are an integral part of the complex mosaic of lands in the region. Based on this importance, it was our intention to quantify how environmental conditions affect ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchange within a mature pine flatwoods forest and determine how specific components of the system, (i.e. leaf physiology, soil respiration, understory composition and canopy structure), contribute to these exchange rates. During the 2000-2001 field season, the natural pine flatwoods was a carbon sink with an annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of 183 g C m-2. The largest portion of this carbon was sequestered during the winter and spring when temperatures were cooler and canopy LAI was lowest. This could be attributed to a reduction in ecosystem respiration losses and a slight increase in understory photosynthetic rates caused by a larger portion of total radiation reaching the understory. Approximately 90% of the respiratory losses from the system could be accounted through soil respiration, which is highly correlated to soil water potential (r2=0.77, p<0.001). Comparison of eddy covariance measurements above and below the pine canopy indicated that 37% of the ecosystemís carbon, 51 % of its latent energy, and 56% of its sensible heat fluxes could be attributed to the understory. Preliminary results show that two species, Serenoa repens and Ilex glabra, comprise 95% of the understory vascular and both have relatively high leaf nitrogen concentration and photosynthetic capacities (~1.4% nitrogen and Amax ~ 4.0 mmol m-2 s-1) and account for ~ 90% of the carbon sequestered by the understory community. These initial assessments provide evidence that natural pine flatwood forest of Florida may be a small regional carbon sink.\nKEY WORDS: pine flatwoods, carbon and water exchange, eddy covariance", "id": "<urn:uuid:09d8a50e-b5b5-4ac8-9b83-20535564e5da>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://abstracts.co.allenpress.com/pweb/esa2002/document/17486", "date": "2013-05-18T05:53:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9265906810760498, "token_count": 537, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

That's what was used in the original Rivers' EGDT study.\nI've never even seen one before.\nMany emergency physicians are getting around not having the specialized equipment issue by obtaining intermittent venous blood gas measurements off of a central venous line.\nBut what if you had a 30 y/o woman with early pyelonephritis/urosepsis who has severe sepsis by definition? She's got 10 peripheral lines (I'm exaggerating, of course), a normalized blood pressure with early IV fluids, and appears non-toxic. Her lactate, however, is 9! Do you really need a central line? My gut says no, but the EGDT protocol says yes -- for the purpose of CVP and ScvO2 measurements.\nTrick of the Trade:\nUse a less-invasive approach where bedside ultrasound and serial venous lactate levels replace central venous lines and ScvO2 measurements, respectively.\nLast year, JAMA published a landmark study showing that lactate clearance of ≥10% over the first 2 hours is \"not a worse measurement\" than ScvO2≥70%. This double-negative statistical speak came about because it was a non-inferiority study.\nSo how does this affect the original Rivers protocol? To review, here's the original protocol, which I posted about earlier:\n(click to view larger image)\nIn the less invasive model:\nFluid resuscitate through peripheral IV access instead of a central line.\nFollow volume status either with a bedside ultrasound or urine output.\nFollow venous lactate levels at time 0 and 2 hours. If the lactate clearance is ≥10% over these 2 hours, you should follow the algorithm as if the ScvO2≥70%. That means no need for immediate transfusion or vasopressor agents.\nHow do you know when you have adequately volume-resuscitated a patient using bedside ultrasound? Measure the IVC diameter about 1-2 cm from the right atrium junction.\nIf the IVC diameter ≤1.5 cm and has ≥50% collapse with inspiration, the patient has a very low CVP.\nIf the IVC diameter is at least 1.5 cm and has minimal collapse with inspiration, the patient is euvolemic. Move to the next step -- assessing the MAP.\nThis doesn't mean that all EGDT patient should have ONLY peripheral lines. Persistent hypotension, a non-clearing lactate level, and/or clinical toxicity warrant more invasive monitoring and management.\nScott Weingart has an in-depth, 21-minute podcast about the JAMA article and noninvasive approach to sepsis: Podcast link. Scott also briefly interviews Dr. Alan Jones (Carolinas Medical Center), the first author of the study, in the podcast.\nReference Jones AE, et al; Emergency Medicine Shock Research Network (EMShockNet) Investigators.

There is a great summary table of the generational differences in personal, work, and educational characteristics, communication styles, and technology.\nThink of faculty who fit in these age groups. Do they fit their generational stereotype?\nTraditionalists (born 1925-1945)\nPersonal characteristics: Loyal, reluctant to change, dedicated, value honor and duty, patriotic\nWork characteristics: Value hierarchy, loyal \"company man\", job security\nEducation characteristics: Process oriented\nCommunication style: Formal\nTechnology: Tend not to understand\nBaby Boomers(born 1945-1964)\nPersonal characteristics: Optimistic, desire for personal gratification, highly competitive\nWork characteristics: Workaholic, competitive, consensus builder, mentor\nEducation characteristics: Learner depends on educator, lecture format, process-oriented\nCommunication style: Diplomatic\nTechnology: Not particularly techno-saavy\nGeneration Xers (born 1964-1980)\nPersonal characteristics: Independent, self-directed, skeptical, resilient, more accepting of diversity, self-reliant\nWork characteristics: Value work-life balance, comfortable with change, question authority\nEducation characteristics: Independent learners, problem-solvers, desire to learn on the job, outcome-oriented\nCommunication style: Blunt\nTechnology: Interested and facile\nMillennials (born 1980-1999)\nPersonal characteristics: Optimistic, need for praise, collaborative, global outlook\nWork characteristics: Team-oriented, follows rules and likes having structured time, career changes\nEducation characteristics: Team-based learning environment, turn to Internet for answers, outcome-oriented\nCommunication style: Polite\nTechnology: Very saavy, technology is a necessity\nThe authors give multiple examples where generational differences come to light but none more so than in mentorship within the academic department.\nTraditionalists view mentorship as a more formal process, where feedback is necessary only to provide criticism or suggestions for improvement.\nBaby boomers also view mentorship as a \"top down\" process. They are ok with infrequent interactions.\nGeneration Xers and Millennialsprefer mentorship as a more \"peer to peer\" process with more frequent interactions. They value the personal relationships and the opportunity to collaborate in creative solutions. Because of their stereotypical distrust of authority, however, they may inadvertently sabotage their relationship with their mentors. Distrust sometimes is misinterpreted as a general lack of respect.\nTo overcome these differences, mentor-mentee pairings should take into consideration gender and shared views about goals, work/life balance, and experiences. Early discussions in a mentorship relationship should discuss generational differences and how each envisions the ideal mentor-mentee relationship to be. The pair should agree upon and adopt a collaborative, shared communication approach with frequent feedback.\nSo much more in this article... Take a read.\nMohr NM, Moreno-Walton L, Mills AM, et al.

In order to master this new skill, he had to actively struggle with it until he succeeded.

{"text": "It’s probably the height of arrogance for me to write a post about how one should taste whiskey. There are loads of people out there who have already covered this base, and they are far more knowledgeable on the subject. For me, whiskey is first and foremost about stories and anecdotes. The tasting of the alcohol is simply the fuel that allows the stories to flow more freely (oo.. how poetic! I’ll have to remember that bit).\nBut, for the sake of those out there who have never thought about “tasting” whiskey, it’s good to put this information out there. And since I will be posting various tastings on this here site, it’s a good idea to give you all the process I will be using.\nFirst and foremost, let’s get one thing out of the way. There’s a huge chasm between the idea of tasting whiskey and the idea of enjoying whiskey. One activity does not necessarily have to include the other. If you enjoy making cocktails out of the various whiskeys available on the market, then have at it. But it’s impossible to get a clear taste of whiskey once you adulterate it with bitters, ginger ale, or sour mix.\nAdditionally, tasting a whiskey involves more than simply putting it into your mouth and swallowing. It’s an encompassing experience, using the same amount of our senses as we use when consuming any other food or drink. So let’s define tasting as the act of learning the characteristics of the flavor of whiskey through the use of the senses. But which senses? The same ones used for tasting wine and judging food – seeing, smelling, and tasting.\nThe eyes gives us insight into the drink. It can tell us how young it is, or the kind of barrel in which it was aged. Generally speaking, the lighter the whiskey, the younger it will be. Whiskey straight from the still is often white, while there are some whiskeys out there that have been aged so long than they have a deep red to them. Bourbon gets it amber red color from the new and freshly charred oak barrels used in its aging process. If bourbon did not use new barrels, or if they didn’t char the new barrels they did use, the Kentucky spirit would have a completely different color.\nFinding the nose of the whiskey is even more important than the look of it. Some would say that the aromas of the whiskey is more important than the taste. From my reading, I’ve found that it’s not uncommon for blenders to base their recipes primarily on aromas. But if you’re not a blender, the nose is of secondary importance, behind taste.\nTo release the aromas of whiskey, a little water may be necessary. The best way to think of this is that a bit of water wakes up the whiskey that has been asleep from anywhere from 3 to 25 years. But how much water? According to Michael Jackson, you want to add just enough water dilute to around 30% alcohol by volume. Roughly speaking, this translates to a .5 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if your drinking 80 proof whiskey, or a 1 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if you’ve found yourself a whiskey that’s 100 proof. This is simply a rule of thumb, and one should expect many exceptions to this, especially in the older whiskeys.\nA quick side note – ice should be avoided, as well as chilled water, as they close down the aromatics of the whiskey. The water added should lack any obvious characteristics of its own. For example, you wouldn’t add mineral water to your whiskey. It is said that the best water to add to the whiskey is the water found at the site where the whiskey was distilled. Since I’ll assume that the vast majority of you out there are not millionaires, and cannot fly off to Kentucky or Speyside simply for a drink of whiskey, let’s just stick to bland water.\nSo what are you looking for when you smell a whiskey? That I’ll leave up to you to decide. From my point of view, there are no wrong answers to this question, because tasting is a very personal experience. If you place your snoot in a dram and the aromas remind you of Newark, then by god, that’s what you experienced. Yes, there is a vocabulary used by professional tasters, and usually they are simply variations of more broad terms (woody, fruitful, medicine, smoky, citrus-like). The aromas you find will likely trigger some sort of sense memory. The skill of a professional taster is to put a very specific and accurate word to describe their own sense memory. Or to put it another way, an amateur taster may say that a drink smells a bit fruity and a bit woody. A good taster will say that a whiskey carries a strong oak smell with an undercurrent of raisins. A great taster will say that the whiskey had been in two different casks, one that used in bourbon and the more recent one used in the making of sherry; additionally, there are hints of currants and peaches, as well as a little bit of vanilla.\nAll of these answers are right. The reason the last taster was able to put more words to the aromas was because they do this activity more often.\nThat’s the end of part 1. Tomorrow, I’ll post about whiskey glasses, and what to do once you actually put the whiskey in your mouth. And, as always, feel free to correct any of my mistakes by addressing them in the comments of this post.", "id": "<urn:uuid:574a5d4e-cf33-4332-b205-9d281ca214eb>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://accidentalhedonist.com/how-to-taste-whiskey-pt-1/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9597218632698059, "token_count": 1182, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Well, these are still some\ndifficult questions to answer with pin-point accuracy, and at this point I don't\nbelieve anyone has the exact answer to all 3 of these questions. What I offer\nbelow is a mix of what I Think, What I know and what Appears to be....\nAnyone currently attempting to\nanswer these questions with some type of \"Universal Knowledge\" on the\nsubject--is Full of BS--BEWARE! Yes, that includes Me. I don't have the\nComplete answer to these questions--and neither does anyone else. This is\na subject that needs to be studied in-depth by someone that has all the\nresources to carry it out: Lab, veterinary knowledge/skills, Acrochordus snakes,\nWhat is it:\nAt this point--I don't know, but here\nis what I believe based on experience, observation and research: The skin of the\nAcrochordus javanicus and arafurae is very impermeable. So, that makes it a very\nprotective mechanism against the outside world. It is commonly understood that\n\"Stress\" causes a reduction in the ability of the immune system to do its\njob--in humans and other animals--including Acrochordus snakes. Stress appears\nto cause a decline in the immune system of Acrochordus snakes causing a decline\nin the effectiveness of the skin as a protective barrier against the outside\nworld. This loss of effectiveness increases until Secondary Infections set in and\nultimately kill the animal.\nWhere does it come from:\nSee the paragraph above and add:\nImproper Husbandry. Yes, it really is that simple. In the Wild, these animals\nhave the ability to move from Habitat to Habitat--Microenvironment to\nMicroenvironment. Even though the White Spot Fungus appears to be a \"Captivity\"\nProblem--the snakes in the Wild maybe be able to prevent it--not by some\n\"Magical Bacteria\", but, rather: by simply selecting\nEnvironments/Microenvironments that they are \"Happy\" with--i.e., minimum\nsustained stress level. In Captivity--the snakes don't have that choice. Plain\nand Simple. Additionally, it appears that the more acclimated to captivity that\nthese snakes get--the more secretive and stress prone they become.\nHow do We get rid of it:\nProper Husbandry--Yes, it really is\nthat simple. Reduction of \"Stress\" will reduce the Progression of the White Spot\nFungus. I have seen it myself. Elimination of Stress will Halt the progression\nof White Spot Fungus. Note: I did not say anything about chemicals, medications,\netc.--just eliminate the Stress and the progression of the White Spot will stop.\nWhat is there will remain until the next shed. After the next shed--the animal\nwill be clean and remain that way--as long as all of the husbandry parameters\nare and remain in order. Its just that Simple. A new animal going through the\nacclimation process may need to shed 2, 3 or even 4 times before the White Spot\nrelents completely. However, its progress should be visibly reduced with each\nSo, what is \"Proper\nHusbandry\"? Well, that's what this website is about. No, I don't have all the\nanswers right now, but I've come a long way in the last couple of yrs dedicated\nto these snakes.\n1) If You are genuinely\ninterested in these snakes--then read this website: Every page, every word, look\nat every picture. This website is not setup for those who are just mildly\ncurious at best. Those folks are more then welcome here. But a lot of\ninformation is \"Hidden\" within the text for those who are serious about these\nanimals. Nothing is truly \"Hidden\", but even this explanation is not sitting on\nthe Front Page for the \"Scanners\" to see.\n2) Spend the hours necessary\nresearching these animals for Yourself. Right now, the more people that reach\nthe same conclusions--based upon knowledge and experience--the Better. The\nOnline Bibliography at the\nlink is a Good place to start.\n3) Acidic water (pH~6.0), Low\nTDSs (~200ppm), Low light--especially in the hide, Lack of vibrations, etc are\nGood key elements to the reduction of Stress and the furtherance of \"Proper\nRecently (4/2007) I have seen\na couple of \"For Sale\" ads for Acrochordus javanicus for one vendor that are\nwrought with misinformation--therefore: Misguidance on the keeping of these\nsnakes. One ad was for CB Babies basically stating to put them in acidic water\nand because they are CB and White Spot free--You (the buyer) don't need to worry\nabout any future \"Bacterial Infections\". Sorry, it just doesn't work that way.\nThe current ad states:\n\"I have adult specimens of Acrochordus javanicus, about 4' in\nlength. Perfect specimens with no scrapes, scar, and most importantly NO SKIN\nBLISTERS! As many people know WC adult Acrochordus javanicus are very rarely\noffered for sale, primarily because of the high mortality rates due to improper\npackaging during transport which causes skin blisters (Pseudomonas bacteria\nwhich cause septicemia, aka \"Blood Poisoning\").\nYou won't have to worry about that here. These adults came in perfectly and\nthere were transported correctly. I am only able to offer unsexed specimens.\nThis species is usually female heavy. There are many reports of this species\nbeing able to be parthogenetic, with LTC females \"cloning\" themselves. A great\ndisplay snake, they feed on fish. As with all Acrochordids, I reccomend great\nfiltration and the regular addition of a product called \"koi zyme.\"\nI am asking $250.00 per a specimen, quanities are limitied. Once\nthese are gone I will be a few more years until such nice large animals come\nInformation. Improper packaging/shipping is only one factor and most importantly:\n\"You won't have to worry about that here.\" That's Pure\nNon-Sense. I am familiar with\nthis particular individual. He claims to have \"...many years of Experience with\nAquatic Snakes.\" and apparently did a stint at a local zoo which I guess makes\nhim a Guru in his own mind. His website is and has remained void of his Great\nclaims of \"accomplishments\" (suddenly that's changing 6/07 LoL) and has been up for a few yrs now. Buy the\nsnakes--just don't buy into the BS claims. Apparently this person thinks that\nyou just need to buy the \"Clean\" animal from him, toss it into \"acidic water\"\nvia peat moss, add Koizyme and Wha-La: Instant Acrochordus! Again, Sorry, it\ndoesn't work that way. If it were that simple: Someone would have\nfigured it out a Looong time ago. I have used Salt, Koizyme, Melafix and\nPimafix. I have also researched those products and contacted the manufactures\nwith any specific questions that I had. One thing that I can tell you is:\nNone. Not One of those products are necessary to successfully\nkeep an Acrochordus javanicus or arafurae, Or halt the White Spot Fungus. More\nimportantly, in reference to the Ads,--Just because You receive a clean\nanimal--doesn't mean that it is going to stay that way. That whole\nthought process is coming from a Total lack of Experience. If that\nwere True--Plenty of people would be successfully keeping\nJavanicus. Am I being\nHardcore: Maybe. But I don't think that I am. I am tired of seeing these snakes\ndie--that's why I am working with them with the dedication that I am. That's why\nI put up this website--including all of the hours and hours of putting it\ntogether and the added expense. That's why I am willing to Openly call these\nso-called \"Gurus\" out here--and on the Forums. Sadly, they don't go\n\"heads-up\" with me in public any more. They just continue to hold onto their\nerroneous beliefs and pass along their Bad Information. These\nanimals will always go to the skin trade. But let's get it together and get them\nestablished in captivity, so they will always be around, and so people will be\nable to experience and enjoy their unique presence. I'm no rocket scientist, but\nI am a guy that can do research and think my way through most problems. If\nAcrochordus husbandry was as simple as some make it sound: This website would\nnot be here. And You can tell from reading this website that A) its not that\nsimple, and B) its a lot more involved than the \"Gurus\" want You to believe. I\nhave come across a number of individuals that all claim that they have kept\nAcrochordus snakes long-term. Notice: the Past tense of: HAVE!\nStrangely, None of them happen to be \"Currently\" keeping\nthem. Always--Past Tense! Hmmm, I'll leave You to Your Own\nConclusions on that one. Just Beware of the \"Claims\" out there.\nFollow the path that You feel is Best--but base it upon Research and,\nWhite Spot Fungus? Its caused\nby Stress and, basically, it appears to be a break-down in the skins ability to\nprotect the animal from the Outside World, eventually leading to Secondary\nInfections that lead to the demise of the snake. There is No \"Magical\" Bacteria\nthat Your snake was or was not exposed to in the wild--these snakes die in captivity\nfrom White spot all over the world--including captivity in Asia that contains\nwater from their own natural environments. Improper Shipping is not the sole\nsource of White Spot, Skin Blister, Whatever. Animals that Arrive in Your hands\n\"Clean\" Will develop White Spot if Housed Improperly and\nWill die from it if the Husbandry Parameters are not Corrected.\nWild-caught, Captive Born, Captive Bred and Born--doesn't matter. Tolerance is\nthe only difference between these animals--Environmental Imprints on their\nbrain. Captive Bred and Born babies are always at least a bit easier then\nCaptive Born babies. Captive Born babies are always a bit easier than\nWild-Caught babies. Wild-Caught babies are always easier then Wild-Caught\nadults. Acrochordus snakes are no different.\nIf You see White Spot fungus\non Your animal--the First question is: Is it Progressing? If it is, then\nYou probably need to fix something. If not, then the animal may just be\nacclimating (If new or just put into a new setup), or the source of stress was\ntemporary and has already been corrected. Is it a \"Death Sentence\"? No,\ndefinitely Not. So, don't Freak-out and start adding Salt or any of that\nother stuff. Don't start ripping the snake out for Salt Baths, Melafix Dips or\nany of that non-sense. You will just be ADDING stress. Just\nstep back and look at the Big Picture. Observe the snake's behavior. Try to\ncalmly sort out what may be wrong. As stated in the\nJavanicus Caresheet: It could be something as simple as Your kid(s) or 150lbs\nRottweiler bouncing around on the wood floor, or the Thumping from Your too cool\nHome Entertainment System. White Spot Fungus is just an indicator that let's You\nknow that the snake is stressing about something. But it can kill\nYour snake--if You don't do Your Job.\nThis Information is offered on the Acrochordus\njavanicus and Acrochordus arafurae Filesnakes as is. This Information\nis not offered in reference to any snakes other than the Acrochordus\njavanicus and Acrochordus arafurae Filesnakes and even so:\nuse at You Own Risk!\nAdditionally, this caresheet is obviously based upon admittedly limited\nexperience! It is not intend to be a recipe of do this, do this, do this---Bam!\nYou have a cake. It's intent is to offer more of a conceptual understanding of\nthese fascinating creatures and their apparent needs both in the wild and in", "id": "<urn:uuid:04af5650-b7ba-42b0-af26-e8a95cfaedf9>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://acrochordus.com/whitespot.htm", "date": "2013-05-18T05:59:08Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9417677521705627, "token_count": 2763, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Does Turkey offer a model that the Mideast can emulate? avril 13, 2012Posted by Acturca in Moyen Orient, Turquie.\nTags: AKP, Arab Spring, foreign policy, Middle East, Neo-Ottomanism, Nora Fisher Onar, Turkey, Turquie\nThe Daily Star (Lebanon) April 13, 2012, p. 7 Türkçe\nBy Nora Fisher Onar *\nTurkey is often touted as an inspiration for the countries of the rest of the Middle East – a characterization it accepts and pursues. In recent years, Turkish policymakers have worked hard to establish “Turkey Inc.” as the model of a relatively free, stable and increasingly prosperous Muslim-majority country with great economic and foreign policy leverage. But what does the Turkish experience actually represent for the states of the Arab Middle East? How convincing is Turkey, Inc. – and as a model can it really be emulated?\nPerhaps the most attention has been paid to the free and fair rise to power of Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), which Islamist movements in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Syria have heralded as a symbol of Muslim majoritarian democracy – even explicitly referencing it in the names and platforms of their own parties, movements and factions. To both domestic and international observers, this might signal that, like the AKP in Turkey, Islamist parties elsewhere do not seek to dismantle their states’ secular framework – at least for the time being.\nBut in spite of its appeal to both traditional Islamists and “post-Islamists” – that is, those who fully reconcile their particular politico-religious commitments with globalization – the Turkish formula may not be replicable. Civil-military relations in Turkey have undergone a double-sided transformation over recent decades. As a consequence of the intermittent censure by the army, political Islamists had to moderate their demands and practices; simultaneously, the Turkish army – accustomed to the barracks and aware that interference in government hurt Turkey’s international standing – increasingly relied on civilian allies to pursue its agenda vis-à-vis the AKP.\nEventually, the military relinquished control of crucial institutions (such as the National Security Council), and the final showdown over control of the presidency in 2007 was fought not with bullets and tanks, but with Web declarations, public rallies and court cases. A similar tipping point regarding civilian control of the state is hardly a foregone conclusion in countries still under transition, where national militaries continue to exert a dominant presence in political life.\nOther countries in the Middle East also lack the trajectory that Turkey has followed with regard to its economic development. This is particularly true of the export-driven rise of the middle class that has been experienced by religious constituencies across the Anatolian periphery. Such a trend has underpinned the AKP’s moderation, political success and interregional presence. Indeed, Turkey’s recent economic trajectory is a central component of its appeal in the Arab world.\nOver the past decade, Turkey has tripled its Gross Domestic Product and – excluding a dip to minus-4 percent real growth in 2009 – has managed to ride out the global economic crisis with relative equanimity. Commentators have argued that Turkey may be part of a second tier of rising economic powers (alongside such countries as South Korea, Mexico and Indonesia) that is hot on the heels of the Big Four (Brazil, Russia, India and China).\nThis holds two implications: On a symbolic level, the Turkish experience (along with that of Indonesia and Malaysia) has dramatically undermined theories of Islam’s incompatibility with modernization, especially in the arena of economic governance. More tangibly, over the past decade Turkey has actively sought out partners for sustainable trade-driven growth in a region that has been long addled by the heady cocktail of oil wealth and chronic underdevelopment.\nAlthough economic partnerships were in no way guided by Turkish concerns for democratic governance – a reality that was attested to by Turkey’s once cozy ties with authoritarian leaders – they have had unintended consequences with positive implications for political reform. For example, the influx of cheaper, better quality Turkish goods in Syrian markets may have undermined a backbone of President Bashar Assad’s regime: namely the interests of the regime’s business cronies.\nTo understand the parameters of Turkey’s role in the region, we should also acknowledge the sensitivities that have arisen from the Ottoman legacy. Some believe that Ankara seeks to reclaim its historical leadership of the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans, something that can rub interlocutors the wrong way. Hence, Turkish foreign policymakers’ reluctance to employ Ottomanist frames of reference.\nHowever, at the domestic social level in Turkey, there remains a growing receptiveness to self-depiction as the benign heir to the Ottoman Empire. This is evident in the proliferation of cultural commodities that employ Ottoman referents. That is the case of the recent record-grossing film “Conquest 1453,” about what Western historiography calls the “fall” of Constantinople. In the film, Mehmet the Conqueror – played by an actor who bears a remarkable resemblance to a young Recep Tayyip Erdogan – is shown to be a forceful and compassionate protector of Muslims and Christians alike (though there is no mention in the film of Jews). The image of Turkey as a “big brother” to downtrodden Muslims in such places as Palestine, Nagorno-Karabakh, Kosovo, and Bosnia-Herzegovina – characterizes an emerging “neo-Ottomanist” national image that seems to drive Turkish aspirations of regional leadership within the country and amplify Erdogan’s profile abroad. Whether this is a matter of hubris or of genuine capacity remains to be seen.\nA final component that is crucial for evaluating Turkey’s example is that the country has yet to develop a framework for meaningful multiethnic, multisectarian co-habitation. Mounting violence on the part of militant Kurds and the Turkish state’s heavy-handed response has fueled hostility between ordinary citizens.\nFor instance, recent court rulings suggest that vigilante terror toward prominent members of the Armenian and Alevi communities is permissible and will go unpunished. Disturbing numbers of journalists, scholars, and students who have expressed critical views on these fronts have been jailed. There is also deep concern in constituencies that embrace secular lifestyles that recent reforms in fields such as education will yield an ever more restricted Turkish society.\nGiven the need to put its own house in order and the fact that inter-communal tensions across the Middle East are likely to become worse before becoming better, Turkey’s AKP government must take very seriously its mandate to write a new and inclusive Constitution. In the longer tem, Turkey must confront the standing challenge of the region – learning to live together despite differences – a challenge which also happens to be Turkey’s own.\nAt the end of the day, the export of Turkey, Inc. needs stable and predictable conditions in which trade and investment can thrive; hence, the commitment to the “zero problems” policy that Turkey employed with neighbors in its economic and foreign agendas over the past decade. Due to last year’s upheavals in the Arab world, however, this policy is unsustainable. Once well-placed to broker a dialogue between Iran and Israel, Turkey is now more alienated from both countries than before as the two nemeses lock horns in what Graham Allison has called the “Cuban missile crisis in slow motion.”\nShould Israeli-Iranian antagonism spill over into war, the delicate balance in Iraq may unravel into protracted sectarian and ethnic conflict, just as Syria’s brewing civil war may spill over into neighboring Lebanon. But even without an Israeli-Iranian showdown and an intensified conflagration in Iraq and Syria, Turkey’s Kurdish question is, quite literally, kindling awaiting a flame, as attested to by recent clashes during Nevruz, or Nowruz, celebrations. All of this suggests that Turkey’s aspirations to regional leadership are tactically dependent on forestalling an Iranian-Israeli showdown – an end to which it should leverage all its diminished diplomatic capital in the two countries and in partnership with the United States.\nBefore the AKP came to power and the Arab Awakening broke out, the received wisdom was that when it came to Islam, democracy and secularism, one could have any two but never all three. Similarly, doubts have long been expressed about whether political and economic liberalism can thrive simultaneously in a Muslim-majority setting. Taken together, it seems that if the purveyors of Turkey, Inc. can show that liberal economics goes hand-in-hand with liberal democracy in a country that is governed by pious Muslims, then the Turkish model-in-progress may achieve fruition and offer a timely example for the Middle East.\n* Nora Fisher Onar is an assistant professor of international relations at Bahcesehir University in Istanbul.

{"text": "Serving diverse populations has never been a strong suit of the health-care system in general; there are huge disparities in the quality of care between whites and African Americans and Hispanics. The law calls for expanded initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in the health-care profession, as well as improved cultural competency. But this will take time. Meanwhile, the existing force of health-care providers will have to adopt a more multicultural mindset -- and that includes increased multicultural intelligence in marketing communications.\nInsurance companies will face a different set of challenges. The law stipulates that by 2014 states must set up exchanges through which consumers can directly purchase health insurance, and all legal residents will be required to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. That will likely force a change in the traditional model of marketing health insurance from B2B to a more consumer-oriented approach.\nSeveral major insurers already are adding retail locations and kiosks in shopping malls, as well as sponsoring health fairs, The Miami Herald reports. Humana, for example, is offering its members a 5% savings at Walmart stores on purchases of fresh fruits, vegetables and other products that carry the retailer's \"Great For You\" label. Though many of the newly insured will be eligible for subsidized health insurance through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, to be successful, insurance companies, like providers, will need to be ready to address the unique needs of a very different demographic than what they are used to.\nThen there are the pharmaceutical companies. According to Gregg DiPietro, in a blog for Pharm Exec, before the new health-care law, \"pharma built its positioning platform almost entirely on two dimensions: efficacy and safety.\" He adds, \"With the approval of the health care law, the conversation has moved ... to one of overall 'value.' ... Efficacy and safety ... are not enough to carry a product's positioning platform.\"\nDorothy Wetzel, former VP-consumer marketing at Pfizer, offers five questions in a recent blog that any pharmaceutical brand needs to ask itself when considering beefing up its efforts to multicultural consumers:\nWhat is the size of the business opportunity?\nDo multicultural patients approach health issues differently than the general-market patients in their disease state?\n- Do the current messages in your communications resonate with the multicultural patient?\n- Does your current media and tactical plan reach the multicultural patient?\n- Are there organizations that could help accelerate access and the impact of your efforts?\n\"You can't standardize diversity and say that all of our diverse populations need this,\" says Russell Bennet, Vice President of Latino Health Solutions at United Healthcare. \"Each population may need different things.\"\nIf we are to count ourselves among the great nations of the world, then Americans have a moral imperative to increase the quality of health care for all. As multicultural marketers, we can help. There is a need to educate about disparities. There is a need to get the word out to medically underserved folks as to how they can take best advantage of the new health-care options. And there is clearly a need for more research that looks into the impact of race, ethnicity and sexual orientation on how one navigates -- and is navigated -- through the health-care system.\nPerhaps the greatest challenge faced by advertisers will be to make Americans -- in and out of the health-care profession -- aware that we do indeed have a disparities problem. A study conducted last year found that only 59% of Americans were aware of racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Before the ad industry takes on this issue -- and it's a tough one, given the current political climate -- its first job will be to educate health-care providers as well as the general public. Once that 's accomplished, the industry can tackle the challenge of how best to reach multicultural patients as important consumers.", "id": "<urn:uuid:00c459a3-0bdd-4cd0-b1a8-2f1a0d1c8fa4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://adage.com/article/the-big-tent/health-care-law-poses-multicultural-marketing-challenges/237911/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:50:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9567733407020569, "token_count": 782, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "This article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, (MUP), 2005\nEleanor Constance (Ella) Greenham (1874-1957), medical practitioner, was born on 15 April 1874 at Ipswich, Queensland, second child and only daughter of John Greenham, an English-born draper, and his wife Eleanor, née Johnstone, from Ireland. John later established a general store, Greenhams Pty Ltd, in the business centre at Ipswich. Ella attended Ipswich Central Girls' and Infants' School then Brisbane Girls' Grammar School, where she won the English and the natural history prizes. On 1 February 1892 she was the first pupil to be enrolled at Ipswich Girls' Grammar School. There she won the silver medal for the top girl in science and four other prizes. Passing the senior public examination next year and winning six more prizes, she proceeded to advanced studies for university entrance.\nIn 1895 Greenham went to Women's College within the University of Sydney (M.B., Ch.M., 1901), entering the faculty of arts as a necessary preliminary to her medical studies. She was the first Queensland-born woman to graduate in medicine. Registered to practise in Brisbane on 2 May 1901 as medical practitioner no.711, she began work as resident medical officer at the Lady Bowen Hospital, Brisbane, probably becoming the first woman to receive a residential position in a Queensland hospital. Choosing to work in private practice, in 1903 she took rooms in City Chambers, Queen and Edward Streets, Brisbane, moving in 1907 to 284 Edward Street. Although she met opposition from some male colleagues, her bright personality and attentive care gradually attracted patients and she built up a successful practice.\nGreenham was dedicated to her profession and, like many early medical women, she did not marry. She was an accomplished pianist, enjoyed attending the theatre and visiting flower shows and was described as 'a large lady, fond of flowing, floral garments'; at the lady mayoress's 'At Home' in 1904 she wore an Assam silk gown and a hat of blue chiffon. One of the earliest women car-owners in Queensland, she drove a Darracq in 1907 and later a Hupmobile. Indeed, she became a shareholder in the Hupmobile agency, Evers Motor Co. Ltd, Brisbane. She also became chairman of directors of Greenhams Pty Ltd.\nIn 1945 the Queensland Medical Women's Society elected her to honorary membership for her contribution to women's health and in 1953 she was made honorary member of the British Medical Association (Queensland Branch) for fifty years uninterrupted membership. In her eightieth year she retired to 85 Oxlade Drive, New Farm, but she continued to treat her old patients.\nGreenham was a pioneer and a skilful, caring doctor. By her persistence and expertise, she swept away difficulties and opposition, helping to shape the future for women in medicine in Queensland. She died on 31 December 1957 at New Farm and was cremated with Anglican rites.\nLesley Williams, 'Greenham, Eleanor Constance (Ella) (1874–1957)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/greenham-eleanor-constance-ella-12951/text23407, accessed 18 May 2013.\nThis article was first published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, (MUP), 2005", "id": "<urn:uuid:7e523ce5-3bca-4d7d-8599-419324a8ac99>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/greenham-eleanor-constance-ella-12951", "date": "2013-05-18T08:09:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9697415828704834, "token_count": 732, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean; Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Now, I don't know if anyone else has thought of this already, but I have a new gusset option for my britches pattern. I'm super excited. While I love my original gusset, it's roominess and the fact that you can knit from the legs up, I'm smitten with this new gusset. It is very very easy knit and still allows for a nice wide leg, though it only works for the top-down version (I'll figure it out bottom-up some day, the concept is in my head, I just haven't done it yet). I'm putting the finishing touches on the directions and will release it tomorrow to everyone who is on the britches yahoo group.\nAlso, I am revamping the whole pattern. Better pictures, more options, clarified wording on some directions that were ambiguous before. I'm adding a \"no options, just the basics\" beginner pattern that I'm hoping will be a great how-to-knit-longies for a new knitter. Since Adorabubble Britches has been out almost a year now (boy, does time fly), I've gotten lots of feedback, many great questions from beginners and suggestions that will be incorporated into this pattern. Since it is just the basics, I will be offering the beginner pattern for just $4. It will be seperate from the whole Adorabubble Britches pattern, but will come with a coupon for a discount on the big Adorabubble Britches pattern. So, if you like the beginner pattern and want all the options later, you won't have to fork over a ton :-)\nI'm also hard at work on the sideways britches pattern, though this one is a little further away from completion than the others.

{"text": "When I was little I watched over and over — really, I truly, truly loved it — a Masterpiece Theater about three sisters who every night would go to a magical ball, only after the castle is completely asleep. To get to the ball, a porthole opened in their room that led to an enchanted, snow-covered wood and a river, which they crossed on rowboats guided by the three male princes. Every morning, their mother would wake them up and groan over how difficult it was to get the girls out of bed, and every week a maid would grimace over how they had worn out their best dancing slippers. Something was afoot, but they could not name it.\nI could look up the plot — but it isn’t the truth that matters to me now, it’s the story in my head. Next: the parents suspected the daughters of something terrible, something grave, and so locked them in their room; but of course, the girls could still reach the porthole, which was within it. Held to questioning, one of the sisters told of the magical ball. To prove it, she brought back a branch of silvery pine and held it out to her father saying Look, look, it’s real — the trees, the lake, the dancing, and the princes who take us. Here is a metonymy for you, a length of wood.\nBut maybe what happened was that walking, she was snagged in the tree, her dress hitched, and they found, entangled in her silks the next day, a branch.\nIn any case I had not thought of the story for so long. In the end, only the best sister — pure, for some reason that the others are not — marries a magical prince. Perhaps the others are tattle-tales, who give it away. Perhaps they choose the life of reality over the one of fiction.\nWhen I thought of the story today for the first time in years I thought, of course: here is a lesson to parents about raising teenage girls; or here is a lesson to teenage girls about sleeping around, about letting boys into your bedrooms: You will be caught, snagged. You will grasp for him and find only a branch, as evidence. Here is a eulogy for the high schoolers heading out to parties in Potomac, who crash their SUVs on River Road and kill themselves and all their riders — this is the fairy tale for them, who live forever in silent rowboats on dark water, captained by strangers who promise in the distance a glimmering ball.\nI think also it is a parable for dreams, which you can never prove with props or worn-out shoes; and of course as well a parable for romance, which comes to us at night, and wears off in the strange light of the morning; or maybe a parable for love — for the sister who found it — for it comes to us at first through a fiction as if of our own making — it’s our thoughts of him, at first, that woo us. And it’s when you’ve got to prove it, you’ve got to find the branch or not find the branch, you may find that you have nothing at all as evidence; or you might find that you are caught there, and can never row back, and that your sisters — beautiful as they had seemed to you, then — are now forever collapsed into their own world and that your father, glaring down at you, holds none of his angry power; the world of the dream has become potent, the daytime world of slippers and lace is stupid, stupid as a fairy tale, stupid as a place you leave. The real is now the dream you thought you had invented, and you see it in all of its crisp textures.\nAnyway, now I only pity the maid.

It was later taken over by the Croatian soldiers who were fighting in Europe, and a part of their uniform was assumed by the French in the 17th century. Under the leadership of the French „God of Sun\" Louis XIV there was a horsemen unit, the so-called Royal cravate, who wore mostly red collar ribbons. The custom of wearing ribbons from the Croats dates back to this time, which was later expanded around Europe and the world, and today is inevitably the most important detail in men's fashion, and also an original Croatian souvenir.

That is where the name for two Croatias derives from, i.e. White in north and Red in south. When the Croats have selected Ferdinand Habsburg to be their King in Cetine in 1527, they confirmed that choice with some seals, and one of them was Croatian coat of arms, but with 64 fields, i.e. the complete chess-board.

It especially helps if you visit the manufacture website. This was my first buying experience with Altrec.com and it has been very pleasant. Great jacket! Just what I wanted and at the price. Thanks Altrec!!\n- March 5 2011\nAnother fine Carhart product. Purchased a large and I wear a 42 regular, this jacket fits just right. Not too heavy, not too light. Well built and comfortable right out of the package. Just what I was looking for, and got it for the best price on the web. Thanks you Altrec!\n- December 30 2010\nCarhartt makes some of the most durable products on the market. It is made with high quality materials. This Jacket is very warm and comfortable to wear and doesnt feel bulky.\n- December 29 2010\nVery durable, thick material and nice color. Like that it is machine washable and has wide arms for ease of movement. Like that it is cotton and does not make a lot of noise when it is cold outside.

{"text": "There’s no doubt of my affections for the Rich Eisen Podcast (REP). I listen to it every week and over the years it’s easily become my favorite NFL related iPod listens. It’s the perfect combination of everything NFL and pop culture so if that’s right up your alley then this is the podcast for you.\nSo it was a very pleasant surprise when I saw that this week’s episode had NFL Network’s Rich Eisen’s sit down with St. Louis Rams head coach and NFL Competition Committee member Jeff Fisher for the REP’s Combine Special.\nThey chat about Coach Fisher’s first year in St. Louis, the NFL scouting combine, and a few other important Rams topics.\nRich Eisen: How do you rank your first year in St. Louis?\nIt wasn’t a rebuilding year… It was not good enough from our standpoint. We lost games that we had a chance to win early on and throughout the season.\nWe learned a lot. That’s the thing I think is so good about what happened. Our young team learned a lot and we have to learn not to let those things happen again.\nIt’s a real fun team to coach and to win a game on the road was a weird experience because they hadn’t done it in a while.\nOur division is an outstanding division. Arizona came to St. Louis undefeated (in week five). We forget about that at the beginning. It was quite a challenge for us and we were proud of the way they played.\n(I love that Coach Fisher isn’t satisfied. Despite taking a 2-14 team to 7-8-1 in one season he did not mention specific records in the interview. I think most coaches would hung their hat on that sort of improvement. But not Coach Fisher. He just saw that the team is improving and growing towards getting better.)\nRich Eisen: “(James) Laurinaitis and Chris Long came to the set after the game. They said that it had been a very long time since they had played a game with a camera hovering over the middle of the field and the whole country watching. In the end, they were enjoying staying on the set so much Deion asked them to leave. But you could see how much joy they were taking in these moments.”\nIt’s hard you know. No team in a five year span in the history of the NFL lost more games than our organization prior to last year. Winning games is what it’s all about. We won a few and then we had one team in particular that took us ten quarters to beat.\nIt’s funny because you go through that tie experience. But then you play them three weeks later and you’re going to guarantee there’s no way that’s going to happen again. … And we were two minutes away from that happening again.\n(I was at that game and stayed after to see Laurinaitis and Long hang out on the set. They were having a great time and most of all I think they were happy for Rams fans.)\nRich Eisen: “That was unbelievable. People maybe for the next decade having trouble dealing with Colin Kaepernick will have your team to blame. Because it was your team that knocked Alex Smith out of the game and ushering in the whole Kaepernick-ness of it all.”\nSorry about that. I would think the 49er fans are also Rams fans at heart.\n(They can specifically thank Rams LB Jo-Lonn Dunbar and maybe DT Michael Brockers. We believe that it was a combination of Dunbar and Brocker’s hits on Alex Smith in week 10 that ultimately started the Colin Kaepernick era in San Francisco. And no sir. There’s no way any 49ers fans would ever admit to being Rams fans at heart.)\nRich Eisen: “Where do you stand on the whole subject on (Cam Newton, RG3, Colin Kaepernick type) quarterbacks and where offenses are going?”\nWell, we’ve got Carolina this year so we’re going to see that offense five times. So we’ve got work to do as everybody else does. And it doesn’t mean to say that another one is not going to pop up someplace. That’s the challenge of the NFC West is the mobility at the quarterback position. The pistol, the read-option whatever you call it.\nThe NFC East has their own new challenge in Philadelphia with the high tempo. The game changes and you’re forced to adjust on both sides of the ball. Defensively we have to adjust.\nRich Eisen: “What do you think Bradford needs to do to take a step into that elite class?”\nHow about have his second year in the same offensive system? Because this will be the first time he’ll be able to experience that. Last year our offense was his third offense in three years.\nWe need to surround him with better people. He can make all the throws. He’s an outstanding deep ball thrower. He has more mobility than people think. He can run for first downs and do that kind of stuff.\nWe can do a better job of keeping him upright. We did that as we moved through the season and minimized the hits. We need to get some better people. We are working at that.\n(Is Brian Schottenheimer’s offense the best fit for Bradford? I don’t know for sure but giving Bradford another year in the same system is a good way to figure it out. More importantly it sounds like the Rams are serious about getting Bradford the weapons he needs to have that break out season. “Better people” is a very broad term but I’m hoping it means solidifying the offensive line. That should be their number one priority.)\nRich Eisen: “What about Steven Jackson? Is he one of those people?”\nHope so. We are in the middle of that. Steven is out of the country and we are talking to his agent. We’d love for him to have a chance to finish his career with us.\n(I read this as “We’d love to have Jack back but not at the $7 million dollar 2013 price tag.” Coach Fisher keeps talking about his young team and I’m not convinced that Jack is going to be a part of that youth movement. The Rams have Isaiah Pead, Daryl Richardson and Terrance Ganaway waiting in the wings.)\nRich Eisen: “Moving forward what are you hoping to get out of this combine? You saw some kids last year that you drafted that made some immediate impact.”\nJenks (Janoris Jenkins), Tru (Trumaine Johnson), Chris Givens and Daryl Richardson…\nWhat you get out of this is you’ve got to aggressively attack the interview process. Get as much information as you can, ask as many questions as you can, and then hopefully we’re going to get enough guys participate where you’d be able to look and see some athletic ability.\nWe have a pretty good sense of the strengths of this draft. We have a good sense of what we need. We’re either going to do with these guys out here or we are going to try and do it through free agency.\n(Strengths of this draft include safeties, linebackers, and on both sides on the line. Which is great news for the Rams since they need some starters as well as depth in those positions. Mike Mayock of NFL Network believes there isn’t really that Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Luke Kuechly-type star player in the first round of the draft. He said the number 20-25 picks in the draft are just as good as the number 5-10 picks. The Rams could be getting some great players with the 16th and 22nd picks in the first round.)\n(Another quick note: Last year’s draft was orchestrated by General Manager Les Snead and Coach Fisher but they were using information put together by the previous regime’s scouting staff. For this April’s draft Snead will have intelligence gathered by his own people. This can only make things better, right?)\nUpdate from @Shields3L – Most of the scouting staff is still the same from last yr. Only 3 guys gone. (Thanks for the info, Tim.)\nRich Eisen and Coach Fisher continue their conversation changing their focus to what was being discussed by the competition committee which Coach Fisher is a part of. Especially fun was listening to Rich Eisen campaign to get rid of his pet peeve, the Tuck Rule.\nYou can listen to the interview in its entirety here or on iTunes. Coach Fisher’s segment starts around the 45 minute mark.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e36c5622-54a4-4a8d-9390-13aaea58108a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aeryssports.com/the-pigskin-arch/2013/02/28/st-louis-rams-head-coach-jeff-fisher-on-the-rich-eisen-podcast/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:02:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9747774004936218, "token_count": 1850, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Here is my progress on the Oklahoma Backroads workshop that I took with Bonnie Hunter last week. I have 20 blocks complete...only 100 or so more to go! :P\nOne idea Bonnie presented was \"bonus triangles.\" This isn't a new idea to me, but it's one that I was never too excited about. It seemed to take a lot of extra time (it does)...and I wasn't sure the time and effort would be worth it.\nShe pointed out that a couple of her quilts in her newest book \"Scraps & Shirtails 2\" were made almost entirely from these bonus triangles. Hmmm...that had my interest a little more. She also shared a way to make those triangles a size that plays well with other size squares and rectangles. I decided I'd give it a try for this project since I would be making a large amount of those \"half\" flying geese blocks above.\nI'm going to show you the technique for making 2\" unfinished triangles from a 2.5\" unfinished flying geese unit. First, find a business card that is 2\" high and cut a 2\" square from one side.\nNext cut the square on the diagonal to make two triangles.\nNow draw TWO lines on your 2.5\" square...one down the center and one with the business card triangle place in the corner. (click image for a closer view)\nSew along both lines...I sew just inside the center line for better results....\nCut between the two sewn lines. Don't fret about the smaller seam allowance! According to Bonnie, it's going to be okay!! The seam is sewn...it's not going to come apart or anything. If you sew 1/2\" away from the center line (in order to have 1/4\" seam allowance), you'll end up with a HST that is about 1 3/4\"...and that dimension doesn't play well with anything else!\nPress both pieces and viola!\nBefore long, you'll have a pile of HST like this! This isn't even all of them....\nLook what I made from 90 bonus triangles!! This is the Quilt Square Quilt Along block for April. How perfect is that? My block is a little bigger than the pattern, because my triangles are bigger, but I think that's okay, right? I love it. I added a small border and I'm going to finish it for a pretty table topper.

{"text": "Eventually, new multiplexes such as the Arclight and the Grove opened nearby and began nabbing the artful specialty films that had long been the Sunset 5’s exclusive domain.When a small business closes in the face of competition from larger firms, it's common to hear complaints about the capitalist system -- along with calls for subsidies or government protection (such as having the location designated a \"historical landmark\"). So I was pleasantly surprised to read the next line:\nSuch is the forward motion of time and commerce.I appreciate and respect the owners' choice to accept the theater's fate with equanimity.\nFor those worried about the lack of venues for independent films, two things: First, as the quote above indicates, the Arclight and Grove theaters were able to squeeze out the Laemmle Sunset 5 in part because they offered independent fare in addition to the usual major-studio movies. And second, the Sunset 5 has been acquired by Robert Redford's Sundance Cinemas, which is currently renovating the theater. As Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, says in the linked article: \"Maybe fresh blood will bring new life into the theater and come new cash too. A face lift on the theater may attract new audiences and make it a place to be.\" Only time will tell.\nUPDATE (added immediately after posting): Before anybody says it, I should point out that the Laemmle family will do just fine. They have other theaters, including new ones opening elsewhere in the L.A. area. Obviously, it would be harder for someone who owned only one location to greet the news with such equanimity. Nevertheless, I respect how the Laemmles responded. Moreover, the usual calls for subsidy and protection don't just come from the small business owners, but from people who have an interest in the business, including suppliers (like indie producers) and devoted customers.

{"text": "Saturday, May 29, 2010\nJim, my personal library, recently gave me an American classic: \"The Making of the President: 1960\" by Theodore H. White.\nThe book chronicles Teddy White's experiences along the campaign trail with Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The writing is outstanding and the insights are second to none. There are countless political observations that are as true today as they were 50 years ago. However, none of those are what stand out for me. There are two paragraphs that are extremely eerie though the power of retrospection.\nThe first is on Page 372, when talking about Kennedy and The Oval Office: \"When the windows are closed, the sound of Washington traffic, which hums as it passes by outside, is entirely locked out, and one is reminded that these windows are three inches thick of laminated glass, thick enough to stop an assassin's rifle bullet from beyond the grounds -- if the assassin gets time enough to sight.\"\nThe other disturbing reference is to a day in the life of John F. Kennedy. On page 375, Teddy White wrote: \"Then the supreme and somber problem of war and peace: a long meeting of one and one quarter hours in the cabinet room with Secretary of State Dean Rusk; Secretary of National Defense Robert S. McNamara; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Lyman Lemnitzer; Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander-in-Cheif, Pacific theatre; two personal advisers McGeorge Bundy and Walter Rostow; and Vice-President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson. Here at this meeting he considered, not for the first time but for the decisive [Whit's italics, not mine] time, American response to the newest thrust of Communist pressure on the changing world -- the movement of Communist guerillas over the jungles and ridges of Southeast Asia into the formless Kingdom of Laos. Could anything be done there, and if it could, should anything be done there? This was the ugliest of problems; and if his decisions were right the meeting would fade into history as unimportant; but if the decisions brought war, then this, indeed, was where the Americans chose war.\"\nI think we can say that the president decided wrong that day.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0b410f0f-8b17-4f80-9b51-77574c2ef7cb>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ahoyhanoi.blogspot.com/2010_05_29_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:12:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9645270109176636, "token_count": 468, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

It tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people and has a maximum ferry range of 560 miles and service ceiling of nearly 28,000 feet. The helicopter was built by state-owned Avic, the same company that recently made Chinese-market Sikorsky S-76 airframes under contract.\nChina is expected to modify its low-altitude airspace restrictions over the\nnext few years, a move that could trigger demand for more than 1,000 new civil helicopters there over the next two decades. Part of its strategy for meeting that demand appears to be leveraging current and future relations with established Western helicopter manufacturers to build its own helicopter industry.\nLast week China flew a new home-grown heavy-lift helicopter for the first time.

{"text": "Latest Team Rankings\nFree Text Alerts\n|College Teams||High Schools|\nMay 24, 2012Auburn heads into the 2012 season looking for better production defensively, and the Tiger coaching staff has brought in the type of players in the past few recruiting classes that are capable of competing at a high level in the SEC.\nThere is always at least one, if not more, players who come out of nowhere and make a big impact on the season every year. A great example would be Nick Fairley, who jumped onto the scene in a big way in 2010, winning the Lombari Award and playing a big role in Auburn's BCS national championship.\nIf Auburn is to compete for championships in the near future, the Tigers will need all the depth possible, particularly along the all-important defensive line.\nOver the next few days we will be making a list of the most underrated youngsters at each position beginning today with the defensive line.\nJustin Delaine (6-foot-5, 280 pounds, Sophomore)\nDelaine was signed to Auburn as a big-bodied athlete with potential to get bigger, and become a force up front defensively.\nThe Linden (Ala.) product was very raw when he stepped on Auburn's campus for the first time, but has shown signs of being able to contribute. Delaine has great athleticism blended with great size, and a long, and lanky frame.\nOnce Delaine learns how to use that frame, he should be able to make some plays for the Tigers going forward. Delaine is very light on his feet to be so big, but doesn't distribute his balance evenly enough, or consistently enough to maintain a strong pass rushing position.\nIf Delaine can improve his power, along with his balance, Auburn could have a diamond in the rough waiting off the edge.\nKeymiya Harrell (6-foot-4, 260 pounds, RS Freshman)\nHarrell showed vast improvement after sitting his first season on the plains by way of a redshirt. One of Harrell's biggest problems early on as a true freshman was his ability to attack the blocker, then shed the blocker, and then go make the tackle.\nOnce Harrell improved his technique, and finally started using his hands to help him, good things began happening.\nAuburn still needs more depth up front on defense, especially with rival teams like Alabama and LSU deploying smash mouth offenses.\nIf Harrell can keep on progressing at his current rate, he should become a very effective hybrid-type defensive lineman.\nJabrian Niles (6-foot-2, 297 pounds, RS Freshman)\nNiles did some good things this past spring, even earning mention from defensive line coach Mike Pelton.\nHowever, the redshirt freshman still has a long way to go to become a complete player.\nThe Mobile (Ala.) product is great at attacking a gap, and then re-directing in the backfield to make a play. His problem at Auburn so far has been getting able to get through that gap to go make the play.\nOnce Niles gets into position to tackle a ball carrier, he is great at finishing plays. Another dimension Niles brings on the inside, is an above average ability to rush the passer.\nHaving an inside pass rusher that can create havoc on second, and third and long is a deadly weapon. Look for Niles continue being brought along slowly, but don't be surprised if he gets a few looks this fall.\nTyler Nero (6-foot-2, 290 pounds, Freshman)\nNero is a very mature inside defensive lineman with great character, and uses his hands at the point of attack like an SEC veteran.\nWatching Nero is exciting because he is quick, and extremely agile off the ball. Nero has incredible instincts, which make him a very consistent tackler, and a constant threat to force fumbles.\nAnother great thing about Nero's game is his effort, and it shows in his game tape. There is nothing an offensive lineman hates more than a big guy that never quits.\nGimel President (6-foot-3, 240 pounds, Freshman)\nPresident is a very underrated prospect who will to Auburn this fall, and his offer list coming out of high school shows it.

{"text": "Sir Gregory Ander\nSir Gregory Ander was born and bred in Queensland, within view of Hartleigh Castle. Born to middling nobles of Alderclass, Gregory was the last of six boys. His elder brothers followed in their father’s footsteps as advocates at Queen Maelys’s Court, but Gregory always sought something a bit more exciting than pushing paper and defending the ruffians in the streets of Hartleigh City.\nWhen he was sixteen, Gregory’s father arranged for him to be accepted into one of the knighting orders, the Order of the Oak, upon the death of Gregory’s closest brother, Bram. The Order of the Oak was not the initial choice of the family, for the Order of the Rose–being the Queen’s personal guard–have a great deal more prestige. Regardless, once initiated, Gregory had little say unless the Queen changed her mind or promoted him elsewhere.\nGregory, being both crafty and handsome, quickly rose through the ranks, and was granted full knightship on the even of his twentieth birthday. He was conspicuously late to his knighting, however, having been spotted with a noblewoman some time before. What a messenger knight was doing in the company of such a woman was certainly up for speculation.\nIt was two weeks later that the very same noblewoman was discovered dead in her apartment. While Sir Ander was no where near the woman’s abode at the time, and therefore could not have been involved directly–so the advocates from his family argued at court–he was acquitted of all charges. The advocates on behalf of the woman’s family, Fortesque & Nob, filed an official complaint after the trial, but it was quickly thrown out by the High Counselor herself, having noted that a decision was made and the law would be upheld.\nAs a messenger knight, Sir Ander is frequently dispatched up and down the Continent, and sometimes across the sea and into the Isles, as well. While his fellow knights are extremely loyal to him, and have only the most glowing comments to make on his behalf, some will tell you different. If you visit some of the seedier establishments in the Territories, for instance, not a few Innkeepers will tell you about the fresh-faced Oaksguard with a penchant for roughing up their girls.\nSir Ander is a man of contradictions. He is young, but jaded; clever, but arrogant; passionate, but cruel–he loves the attentions of women, but cannot stand their company.\nWhen Sir Ander walked into the Territories towns to collect Alderclass girls on an errand from the Queen, he used her writ as absolute law, reportedly threatening violence should the towns not cooperate and hand over their young women. And it is rumored that what violence was seen was due to his command, though it has officially been blamed on an interruption by the Order of the Asp.\nProfile: Sir Gregory Ander\n- Height: 6′ 0″\n- Eye Color: Dark brown\n- Hair color: Chestnut brown, curly\n- Age: 23 Years\n- Hobbies: A collector of “ancient” weaponry, as well as books on the subject. Is known to have a particularly dedicated interest in the use of torture in war times.\n- Issue: None, rumored to have impregnated a noblewoman\n- Spouse: None; knights are not allowed to marry\n- Fashion: Wears the typical garb of the Order of the Oak, which includes a blue silk sash around the wide-brimmed hats, a green vest, and a long, gray duster.

{"text": "Welcome to Alexandra's House\nLife is full of uncertainty with no guarantees. If the life expectancy of your unborn, newborn, or infant is limited, Alexandra’s House is here to help. Many services are provided directly through Alexandra’s House and others are coordinated through a variety of community resources. Residential care is available for those meeting specific criteria.\nAlexandra’s House is a community based, all volunteer, peer-led perinatal hospice and infant care system for parents pregnant with babies with lethal or sub-lethal anomalies, for pregnancies that end unexpectedly at any point, from any cause, and for infants who die in the community, any cause. While its foundation is rooted in faith, its services offer a practical solution in meeting the time-intensive needs of families in these situations.\nAlexandra’s House does not interfere with or substitute for any existing medical, social, or hospice agencies’ services. What it does is to help fill in the many gaps in care that do exist, as defined by those who have lived the experience of caring for a dying unborn or newborn baby. The ideal time to consult Alexandra’s House is at the time of diagnosis or loss: a) so parents are fully informed and b) to help alleviate some of the acute anxiety and very common feelings of isolation and abandonment. Alexandra’s House does not charge for its services nor does it accept contributions from people they serve.\nOver 90% of our referrals come from the medical community – perinatologists, hospitals, doctor’s offices, sonographers, the community at large and through our website. We have followed families in America as far away as Alaska and have provided assistance in the UK, France, Germany, and New Zealand.\nServices include: bringing meaning to suffering, assistance in grief resolution, parent-parent partnering, birth planning, funeral planning, long-term support, one to one and group meetings, pre-natal and post-natal housing, if required. If a baby survives and is dismissed from the hospital, the family and baby can stay here for the duration of their life. Professional nursing services are provided through a licensed hospice agency.\nShe never opened her eyes but I already knew her eyes sparkled like the night sky. Sophia, born an angel, that God already needed. Her life lasted only a few hours but changed by life forever. Only the best die young. Sophia deserved the life that she will never be able to experience but we will life through her. She made the biggest impact on my life even though she'll never know it.\nIt was a rainy day. I was at the hospital because my Baby sister was born her name was Sophia. I held her. She was light like a pillow. It was fun. I like it I miss Sophia\nWe talked to our kids this weekend, and they were so individual, heartbroken and sweet. Our daughter, Annie, said she thought God must have put four seeds inside of me when I was created and one was an angel seed. So I had three babies and now I would have the angel baby. That's the story I am going with from now on because it sounds just perfect to me. Our oldest, Leo, was the most emotional.\nJoy and Joya were twins, very special twins. They were joined at the chest and shared one heart. After complex testing prenatally, it was determined that Joy and Joya could not be separated surgically. Neither would survive the surgery.\nTen fingers and ten toes - that's the first thing every parent checks on their newborn. For the parents of Alexandra's House those simple things are not taken for granted. I am Jeanette Burlbaw, a sonographer with 35 years of experience.

Federal Trade Commission reports show tax-related identity fraud continues to plague the United States, most notably South Florida, where more than half of the 20,000 Florida identity fraud cases to the IRS have been detected.\n“It has become too easy and far too common for criminals to obtain the taxpayer identification numbers of people and file fraudulently in their name,” West said. “Today’s meeting with the IRS allowed me to hear directly from the agency as to what investigators are doing to prevent this crime. I challenge the IRS to determine a more efficient system for tracking who these criminals are and how they are obtaining taxpayer identification numbers.”\nIRS leaders discussed with Congressman West several new systems implemented this year to identify and track fraud, including a “detection code” assigned to suspicious filings.\n“I can assure you, we are getting better everyday,” Jodi Patterson, Director of Return Integrity with the IRS, told Congressman West. ”This is a top priority for the IRS.”\nPatterson also assured Congressman West the IRS is improving its system for how operators handle taxpayers who believe their identity has been stolen.\n“We have spent a great deal of time training our operators on how to interact and best help expedite the reporting process, ” Patterson said.\nWest asked the IRS to report back to him at the end of April on improvements the IRS has made over last year, including a report of indicators and warnings the IRS has discovered through its investigation. West also encouraged the IRS to work with local law enforcement to better track down criminals on a local level.\n“Our local law enforcement is well aware of this problem and they want to be involved,” West said. ”I am confident the IRS is listening to our concerns and will continue tracking down these criminals until this problem is solved.”\nPLEASE SIGN UP FOR ALL CONGRESSMAN ALLEN WEST’S E-NEWSLETTERS: west.house.gov", "id": "<urn:uuid:9a9d34ad-e1f5-413c-80f0-057b94bb6b47>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://allenwestrepublic.com/tag/congressman-west/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:50:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9489744305610657, "token_count": 452, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean; Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "The Little Old LadyRegister Today!\nThis is a Article on The Little Old Lady in General Articles About Nursing, part of General Nursing ... It had been a rough day, and I had to be out of work at 3:30 because I had clinical that evening. ...by Ms Kylee Aug 20, '08It had been a rough day, and I had to be out of work at 3:30 because I had clinical that evening.\nI was doing the usual end of shift vitals when I walked past what had been an empty room all day. In the room chair sat a very petite lady looking very lost and scared.\nI walked in, shook her hand, and introduced myself. She told me her name, and followed it by \"I had a doctor's appointment today and he sent me right here and wouldn't tell me why. I don't have anything either. He wouldn't let me go back home and pack a bag.\"\nI told her that we had stuff on the unit, and I'd pack her up a goodie bag and be right back. I returned a few minutes later with the usual patient goodie bag, blankets, gown, lift pad, towels, washcloths, and tissues.\nSensing she wanted to keep her independence, I handed her the gown and asked her if she needed any help getting undressed. She told me no, but asked me to stay with her anyway. After getting her vitals and getting her into bed, I found her nurse and told gave her a report. I followed it up with her being very scared. I stayed with her for another hour and missed clinical, but it was worth every hour I had to make up.\nI had the pleasure of taking care of her for almost two weeks. During her stay, we had wonderful talks and she told me all about her life, her family, and she gave me a wonderful recipe for red gravy. One morning, I was told she needed to go downstairs for a test. I brought the stretcher in to her room and I could tell immediately she was scared. As she got on the stretcher she said to me \"Kylee, I'm scared I won't survive this test.\" I tried to offer reassurance, but nothing came past the lump in my throat. Instead, I gave her a big hug. Before I could think of something to say in reassurance, transport came to take her downstairs.\nTwo days later, I returned from my day off, and didn't see her name on my patient list. As I was puzzling things out, the nursing assistant that I was relieving came to give me report.\nWhen she gave me the first report, my stomach just dropped. My beloved patient had stroked and was life flighted over to our trauma hospital. I held things together till report was finished, then I made a visit to the bathroom and cried my eyes out. When I returned to the floor five minutes later, I got funny looks from the staff, but nobody asked me, and I didn't volunteer any information.\nA week later, I read her obituary in the paper, and I cried as I read it.\nAll I could remember was how she had told me she was afraid to go for the procedure, and how she felt she had another few years of life left to give. I also remembered how she loved bread from an Italian restaraunt in town. I remembered that last hug, and those final words she said to me. \"Kylee, I love you. You're going to be a wonderful nurse someday.\"\nRIP Miss B. I love you too.Last edit by Ms Kylee on Aug 21, '08 : Reason: fixed typo\nPrint and share with friends and family.\nCompliments of allnurses.com.\nhttp://allnurses.com/showthread.php?t=327323©2013 allnurses.com INC.

Hello All, I've been using AllNurses since I began in nursing school but this is my first post....by It's Just a Ride Nov 23, '12Hello All,\nI've been using AllNurses since I began in nursing school but this is my first post. I had a patient in clinical this week and my priority diagnosis isn't completely clear to me.\nThis elderly patient was in the CCU after an AMI with CHF ~ 45 days prior, history of hypertension, diabetes, family Hx of heart disease. He has a trach/vent in place and appears to be unable to wean due to the potential for right side heart failure.\nHis heart is the problem. He's on the vent because his heart can't handle the increased workload, SO, I'm thinking Decreased Cardiac Output as my priority, but they've drilled ABC's into our brains so many times a little voice is telling me \"B comes before C,\" but it's the heart, not lungs, that are the real issue. Right?\nAlso, could I simlpy use AEB AMI, and ventilator dependency? Your insights are appreciated.\nPrint and share with friends and family.\nCompliments of allnurses.com.\nhttp://allnurses.com/showthread.php?t=799002©2013 allnurses.com INC. All Rights Reserved.\n- 584 Views\n- Nov 23, '12 by ImKosherWhat's your related factors? What is your A/E/B? Following your ABC, we need to figure out if the airway and lungs is contributing to his condition at all and if it priority. Tell us a little more about the pt.\n- Nov 23, '12 by It's Just a RideAside from the Hx I mentioned (HTN, diabetes, fam Hx of heart disease), the pt had no indication of CHF until he was braught in for the AMI. He was described as a stable, critical patient. Stable on the vent, critical off of it.\nI was thinking Decreased Cardiac Output or Inneffective Tissue Perfusion, but he is stable currently so those would be \"risk for\" at the moment, right? A therefor wouldn't be used as primary diagnoses. He's on bedrest, NPO, trach/vent, and was in between an NG and PEG tube placement when I was work with him. He is dependent, alert and oriented, and denied any pain although he had a nasty ulcer on the posterior left wrist from dopamine infiltration.\nHis airway has some mucus production so I could go that direction. He required suctioning twice while I was there. His breathing is controlled by the vent. His heart is stable provided his lungs have assistance from the vent.\nThese diagnoses usually make sense to me but after my first day on CCU I'm not sure what direction this should be going.\n- Nov 23, '12 by fireballnursieInsufficient gas exchange related to decreases cardiac function as evidence by inability to ween off artificial life support.\n- Nov 23, '12 by It's Just a RideI can see this connection. Thank you very much FireBall.\nAnd thank you Kosher for the input.\n- Dec 1, '12 by GrnTeaThat would be \"decreased,\" \"wean,\" and we don't say \"artificial life support\" for something like this.\nLet's back up here.\nHow do you know he's on the vent because his right heart might not be able to manage without it? It may be that the work of breathing is just more than he can handle, and if he isn't ventilated mechanically he will not be able to move enough air to stay alive. He is old and has a bad heart, and that resulting weakness may be the reason he's on the vent. The vent doesn't decrease right heart workload per se.\nHowever, decreased cardiac output itself would certainly cause him to be weak. Seems to me that he has at least two priority problems: he can't move enough air to support himself, and his heart is too weak to support any activity. Now, go to your NANDA-I 2012-2014, which every nursing student should have even if his/her faculty neglected to put it on the bookstore list (free 2-day shipping from Amazon), and see what nursing diagnoses fit these defining characteristics. That's how you determine nursing diagnoses-- you identify the defining characteristics by your own assessment, then see what diagnoses they point to. It's just like checking a hematocrit to help make the medical diagnosis of anemia.\nI hope you haven't already turned this in, because in my opinion you're a little confused about cause and effect here. Hope we hear back from you.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2125b549-64b3-4c17-a9d0-5ce81c17ea0d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://allnurses.com/nursing-student-assistance/priority-diagnosis-question-799002.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:12:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9751090407371521, "token_count": 1042, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

We have the guild leader, Beastar, here to tell us more about the guild.Guild: Dead Faction\nCan you give us a little history about Dead Faction?\nDead Faction is a guild created few month ago. Since I started to play in April 2010, its was one of my goals to create a guild.\nSo, I made it with some people that I knew well for a bit. At this moment, we decided our ultimate objective. The ”ultimate objective ” of Dead Faction was (and still) to help new peoples and obtain an Astral ship. Now, we have around 130 members and we are always talking in the chat or partying in Lightwood tavern XD. We’re all happy of what we achieved and we hope to continue our mission.\nWhat are the people of Dead Faction like?\nLet’s say, we have every kind of player: high level, PvP, occasional players, hardcore, clown (yeah, some of us are really funny), beginner, every class and every race! We are really opened to all class, races, and levels. That makes us unique. Nobody feel like being in a sea of people, everyone is important.\nThat’s what we are!\nWhat are the goals of Dead Faction?\nAs I said, our goal is to obtain an Astral ship (and maybe a fleet of Astral ships!) and help everyone. If someone is level 40 and need a party for a dungeon, we’ll help him or her. If a level 10 wants to understand how the game works, we’ll help him or her. Sometimes (in fact everyday), we like to travel to Holy Land and do what we call ” Imperial Hunting”. Its some kind of PvP against imperial players. Every month, we organize guild events (like parties, Goblinball,) and we’re really happy about it.\nHow would one go about joining Dead Faction?\nNone. There’s no criteria. We accept everyone. Every class, race, level, etc. As long as you’re online at least one time every month. Other then that, we’re open to anyone who wants to join.\nWhat do you see in Dead Faction’s future in Allods Online?\nI see the whole guild in the most spectacular fleet of Astral ships, having combat and many exploration in the Astral :), making gigantic war in Nezebgrad and Holy land. That how I saw our future, with a lot of enjoyment and happiness (and party ;p ).\nIf you’re part of a guild and you would like to have your guild in the spotlight, please have your guild leader email us with information about your guild at email@example.com!\nAdd Your Comments", "id": "<urn:uuid:1db0462a-be7f-4845-a9af-4dfb01610d11>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://allods.gpotato.com/news/2011/10/16/guild-spotlight-dead-faction/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:25:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9508643746376038, "token_count": 591, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "SwiftKey Keyboard for Android Gets Smarter\nThe autocorrect function on smartphone keyboards can be helpful, but it can also lead to some hilarious and embarrassing mistakes. SwiftKey, a virtual keyboard for Android, looks to eliminate those errors by learning how you type and predicting what you’ll write next, and it’s getting smarter.\nToday, TouchType, the developers of SwiftKey, released an updated version of the keyboard that brings more intelligent correction capabilities and an improved user interface.\nNew to SwiftKey 3 is a feature called “Smart Space.” This detects when you’ve inserted a space in the middle of a word or forgotten to insert spaces while quickly typing a string of words and automatically corrects it for you.\nThe keyboard also now has a larger space bar and a smart punctuation key that gives you quick access to common punctuation. You can also change up the look of the keyboard with two new themes, one called “Cobalt” and another called “Holo,” which looks similar to the keyboard in Android’s latest operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich.\nFinally, SwiftKey 3 adds support for seven additional languages, including Korean, Serbian and Farsi, bringing the total number of supported languages to 42.\nSwiftKey is different from other virtual keyboards like Swype because it tries to customize itself to the user.

As a result, both the hustle and bustle of city life and the calm serenity of country life appeal to me and have equally influenced much of my work. I have been drawing since I was able to hold a crayon and have mainly worked on very small intricate pictures but have discovered the joy of painting on canvas over the last couple of years along with the excitement of creating large pieces of artwork. The smallest painting I have done was 30 x 40 cm, but as well as several others, I am currently working on a piece of art which is around ten feet long which will be eventually be included on here as well. I often work from photographs which are given to me and paint a large, stylized version to hang on the wall. Of course, many pieces I have done have been personal to the requester and since these tend to be friends, little money changes hands. But now I am working on some that I have chosen myself and that I hope to sell to help my son through university.There are not many to display yet, but I hope you like what you see.

{"text": "My number one obsession is my hair. I’m constantly obsessing over it because it’s the best accessory any women can have. Short, long, curly or straight your hair compliments you and shows off your unique style. You could be wearing the best outfit and the killer heels but if your hair isn’t cooperating and you're having a bad hair day, then honey I’m sorry but your outfit is not complete. I could be in sweats and sneakers but as long as my hair looks good that’s all I care about. The trick to great hair is to find out what works for you. What works for someone with curls may not work with someone who has straight hair. You may have to experiment with different brands be it high end or drugstore to see what’s the perfect combination for you. My mother is a hairdresser so I definitely get my obsession from her! I have curls but I use different hair products when it’s curly and different products when it’s straight.\nYou also have to be conscious of your hair cut. For example, a blunt hair cut is a huge don’t for someone like me with curly hair. That would send my hair into frizz hell! Unless you are planning to keep your hair straight all the time (something I’ve done for the right haircut) then something like that wouldn’t be for you. My tips for great hair are\n- Find yourself a great hairdresser who understands your hair.\n- Experiment with products that work for you.\n- A great haircut makes all the difference!\nWhat hair products do you live by?

{"text": "\"I think it would be valuable if we had... uh... I mean, there's some sense where blogs correct themselves if you read enough of them, but I still I think it would be good if we had some sort of, you know, blogging -- you know -- council, where we could condemn people. Sort of... responsible body. You could still blog if you want. Nobody's going to stop you. But we're going to... everybody's gonna know that you're not to be trusted... unless you can sort of apologize or answer for yourself.\"I thought it was revealing, and I used the quote (cut down a bit) in my NYT column yesterday. (Free here.)\nOn the blog, I said I was \"put off by the mindset he revealed\" -- that desire to \"blacklist\" -- and in the NYT, I called it the \"impulse to control.\"\nAlterman is right to read my quoting and characterization as a very harsh accusation. I wouldn't call it \"the typical liberal tendency toward fascism,\" as he does. If I was going to use the inflammatory word \"fascism,\" I wouldn't say \"the typical liberal tendency toward fascism,\" which makes no sense to me. At the very least, I'd replace \"liberal\" with \"left-wing\" or \"illiberal.\"\nThe idea of fascism does come up in the comments. In the second comment, Jeff says: \"The leftist will to power (and more importantly, control) rears its ugly head.\" A little further down, Mike just says: \"Fascism - Oppressive or dictatorial control.\" And John takes a hard (but humorous) swipe:\nAlterman is one of those pathetic little mediocrities who in another time and place would be a very dangerous person. Put him Weimar Germany, revolutionary France or early Soviet Russia and he would be full fledged rhetorical thug pushing the brown shirted masses to smash windows and heads. As it is, he is just fascist little prick whom you hope will disappear like a rash if properly ignored. I almost hope he would start such a council just so I can start blogging and get on the blacklist.Later, Mike comes back with:\nI don't think Eric Alterman is a fascist (though he is many other disagreeable things) but I find it amusing that it is his ilk who are prone to hurl that term, yet it is they who are the control freaks.So Alterman is right to feel provoked and, really, embarrassed to have shown so much of an urge to repress and control. His own words were telling. It's not my habit to type out spoken word, and I don't monitor Bloggingheads episodes for stray quotes to use to make people look bad. That quote jumped out at me and demanded transcription. And I think Eric knows he was saying something bad. The pattern of the stammer, with the double \"you know,\" is telling.\nLet's work our way through Eric's reverie.\n1) It was a conversation. I was just sort of musing.Right! That's why it's so interesting. The things people say when they let their guard down...\nBut still, it's fair game.Damn right.\n2) I do actually believe what I said. Ever since the beginning of blogging-time, I have worried -- in public and on blogging panels -- about the loss of the media's gatekeeper function. Now, I believe I literally wrote the book on this topic -- and it's about to go out of print for the second time, so if you don't own it, hassle Cornell University Press -- and I am as aware as anyone on earth, I believe, of the dangers of the misuse of that function. Almost all of my books deal with this tension in one way or another. But the fact is, the function is absolutely necessary. A democracy of hundreds of millions of people is functionally impossible for reasons it requires an entire book to explain. Particularly when the media profess to strive toward objectivity, punditry/gatekeepers play a crucial role. My problem with the punditocracy has never been that they are pundits, but that they are so incompetent at the job they do.There you have it. Controlling speech seems to be his mission in life. What's he really saying here? He writes books, and he's obsessed with speech, but he's none too articulate.\nThe \"function\" of \"gatekeeping\" is \"absolutely necessary.\" And, speaking of functions, something is \"functionally impossible.\" On a quick read, I thought he was saying that gatekeeping -- that function -- is functionally impossible. But no, what is functionally impossible is democracy. But you'll have to read his book to understand why. Here we see even more of the urge to control.\nYou can't have your democracy, and there are a lot of complex reasons why you can't, as elite, intellectual study shows. I own the truth. I write the books. If you can get your hands on the hard-to-find book and spend some good long time with it, you might come to understand what I already know. I am the gatekeeper of this information explaining why you can't have democracy. Trust me.\nNotice that phrase \"media's gatekeeper function.\" The media deliver information, but Alterman characterizes that as gatekeeping. The emphasis is on what they don't let out. Not having read his book, I'm not sure what he's driving at in point #1. I get the sense it's that voters are dependent on the media filtering the information well, and bloggers ought to improve that filtering, not bypass it. You don't want too much information, because it might be bad.\n3) If bloggers are going to perform this function -- that is, helping busy and usually uninformed people make sense of the world -- we are going to have to employ some sort of standard with which to judge their reliability. If they are pathological liars, psychopaths, religious or ideological extremists who cannot be trusted to tell the truth, well then, it'd be useful to have them branded as such -- in order to keep them from further infecting the body politic with even more lies, ideological obsessions, and intellectual corruptions. True, the mainstream media do not do a great job of this themselves anymore, but many people inside it do try. In many cases, their brands and relationship to their peers depend on it.Speech as disease! Some speakers are sick, and they may cause infection! He would justify quarantines. This man does not believe in free speech. He will not put his faith in the marketplace of ideas and the remedy of more speech.\n4) Bloggers tend to argue that this problem will sort itself out over time.That's scarcely some eccentric blogger thought. It's the core idea of American free speech.\nI worry about the \"over time\" part. I also worry about all the damage that can be done in the interim.This is the mindset of a censor. Of course, you mean well. You're here to save us from ourselves.\nAnd so I raised it on Bloggingheads.tv and offered up a notion in response. Maybe it's a bad idea. It's not as if I gave it any thought before I said it.Well, you did write those books. This is your area of expertise, isn't it? It's just that you let the words tumble out this time, and it showed more ugliness that you would have liked. If only you could control things more, control freak.\nBut I'm not convinced it is [a bad idea]. Or at least, I've yet to see a better one. After all, it's a panel of bloggers; it's the judgment of one's peers and it would enjoy no power whatever, save the influence it amasses by virtue of the quality of its judgments. Just what is so threatening about that?I'm not threatened by your panel. I simply loathe your censorious frame of mind, your fear of speech as sickness, your urge to control and purify, and your belief in the beneficence of panels. I thank God that I live in a country where the institution you dream of would not be allowed to \"enjoy power.\"\nSo now, instead of quivering in fear about what my supposed \"peers\" would like to do to me, I'll have another cup of coffee and a nice little giggle over the way you finally expressed some faith in the marketplace of ideas -- when it came time to talk about why your damned panel should be trusted.\nI love a little irony in the morning.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a8954203-691a-4614-b96f-77cde88d379c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://althouse.blogspot.com/2007/02/eric-alterman-contemplates-whether-he.html?showComment=1172681220000", "date": "2013-05-18T06:54:37Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9769275784492493, "token_count": 1786, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Really it is a subjective thing and the bride and groom get the only votes.\nI don't see how it can be bad etiquette if the bride and groom were happy to see her there.Did she send a gift?\nThat's a lovely picture at the link.\nIf I understood the article correctly the bride and groom left their event to see her, not the other way around. And they were evidently thrilled to see her. She neither tried to, nor did, upstage the bride.Are you practicing writing headlines for the MSM, Ann?\n\"a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures. The newlyweds now had another reason to grin from ear to ear as they were overheard saying “we’ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our wedding”. She was invited. Post fail.\nPer the article, Palin was in one area and the wedding party was in another. I'm sure you've all been in restaurants with similar semi-separate function halls. The couple sought her out, not the other way around. No foul. No bad etiquette.\n\"The couple seemed happy about it, so yes.\"Did they have much choice?

How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?\"Again, it appears they left their party in a back room and came out to see Palin. And Palin has never struck me as the type of person who would barge in on a wedding party. Hillary sure. Barry definitely. Palin, I don't see it. Maybe she did, but that's not what the article says.So, yes, I'd say they had a choice.Seriously, the guy is a US Marine. I doubt you could find many who wouldn't be thrilled to see her. And that includes the wife of one.\n\"Ann Althouse said...Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?\"Let me go out on a limb...they could have not asked her?\nI don't see how it would mar \"her day\", but I do see how it would make it far more memorable for their guests, and I think all couples want that. I assume the woman was just as pleased as she sounds, and that she wouldn't have left her wedding reception to hit the chicken wing counter for just anyone.\nLimbaugh did that.He crashed some wedding reception that happened to be going on in the hotel where he was.Invited by a band member he ran into.It also turned out to be a military groom; and likewise got a favorable reaction from them.\n\"I am challenging you to think more deeply.\"If thinking deeply means reading things into the article that are not there, I guess I could come up with a dozen possible senarios.So, yeah, if Palin had without invitation entered the back room where a private bridal party was being held for a photo op that would have been a violation of etiquette. It also would have been politically stupid.But I don't see Palin as either rude enough to do it nor, at this stage in her political career, stupid enough to do it.\n\"Ann Althouse said...I am challenging you to think more deeply.\"Everything in the artice points to a joint decision to ask Palin for pictures, as well as a mutual satisfaction that she did so.I am challenging you to think. Period.\nAnn Althouse said... I am challenging you to think more deeplyIn other words, read between the lines, because it might not be there when you read the article.\nReally, Professor? Have you ever been to the Puritan? Do you know anything about it? How it's laid out? She went into the main part. The Marine and his bride were in a private room quite a ways away. They came to greet her and ask her for pictures. Had she not taken the time to visit with them when they asked, what would the headlines read? Jesus fucking Christ on a fucking pogo stick. \"I'm challenging you to think more deeply.No, you're not. You're just being blonde and it's not attractive, not matter what Meade tells you.\nI am challenging you to think more deeply.The appearance of this sentence is always an infallible sign that Althouse has been caught in an error.\nPALIN CRASHES WEDDING!UPSTAGES BRIDE!OPENS HER GIFTS!SLEEPS WITH HER HUSBAND....developing....\n\"It makes the reception that much more memorable (in a good way) for the guests, which flatters the bride.\"Well, that's kind of my theory of weddings, which is why I didn't want one. If it's all about making the guests have a great time and not a boring time like all those other weddings... save your effort and money...I think people who put on weddings are thinking about making the bride a fabulous center of attention. If another woman upstages her... it's not what that was about.\nBTW:Ann Althouse said... “we’ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our wedding”. Is that the memory the woman was hoping to lock into her permanent memory? In the phrase \"It's her day,\" the \"her\" isn't supposed to be a politician that shows up for a photo op.*************It was, by the way and don't forget, the reception. They left their reception and asked Palin for pictures. Palin didn't crash the damn wedding demanding the focus be on her. Palin went to a fairly famous local eatery to get some of the fairly famous chicken fingers and chat with some locals. That's hardly showing up for a goddam photo op. Then, while she was waiting for her food, she was accosted by a young Marine and his wife all agog and agibber that Sarah Fucking Palin was there.Jesus.\n\"She went into the main part. The Marine and his bride were in a private room quite a ways away. They came to greet her and ask her for pictures.\"I'm picturing the guests getting wind of Sarah's presence and scampering away from the wedding to get a look. That's stage 1. The bride is upset by that and the people around her try to make the lemons into lemonade or whatever.\n\"Palin went to a fairly famous local eatery to get some of the fairly famous chicken fingers and chat with some locals. That's hardly showing up for a goddam photo op.\"It's obviously a political photo op. Give me a break. I'm not saying Palin intended to crash the wedding, but that's the way it played out.\nrhhardin said... Limbaugh did that.Did what? Stand downstairs at the take out counter and be accosted by a Marine and a woman in a wedding dress? Not the same thing. Don't write it like it is.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) Let me just add for the progressives, “Quitter”, “Ditz”, “Unelectable” “Smurf-house Al-tards” Capishay? Oh and I liked the phrase \"Think more deeply\" and the retort...\"I made an error\".\n\"I'm picturing the guests getting wind of Sarah's presence and scampering away from the wedding to get a look. That's stage 1. The bride is upset by that and the people around her try to make the lemons into lemonade or whatever.\"I give up. She was probably pissed. So pissed I imagine it's a wonder she didn't ask her Marine husband to snap Palin's neck like a chicken finger.\nIf you cared to read the article, the bride and groom sought out Palin, to be photographed with her.She really sticks in your craw, eh?\nWhat proof do you have that it was obviously a photo op? A couple of days ago Palin wore dark glasses and an extra shirt and a hat pulled low to run a half marathon. It's not like she's some sort of messianic figure traveling across the country in a giant black armored bus with a 40 vehicle motorcade!Yes, she went there to get chicken and talk to people. But I don't believe she sent her advance people in to drag the Marine and his bride out to see her. I ask you again: have you ever been to the Puritan? The Marine and his bride had to actually leave their private room. It's not like they were just at a table in the back. Ask me how I know....\nThe only thing that could have upstaged that was to continue with honeymoon three-way.\nWILL SOMEONE TAKE THE SHOVEL OUT OF THE PROFESSOR'S HANDS BEFORE SHE STRIKES WATER AND FLOODS THE HOLE SHE'S DIGGING!\nI don't see how famous people can avoid all possible places where a wedding reception might be occurring. So you can't blame Palin for being near a wedding reception, or for the reaction of people at the venue.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) I will say that IF Palin gets in and gets the nod, Althouse will NOT be voting for her? Someone said it best, “She sticks your craw.” Palin just sticks in Althouse’s craw and so the Althouse demographic is a write-off for Palin in 2012, that’s for sure….Let’s try one more tack here, Althouse, IF the bride were upset, don’t you think she could have found a sympathetic blogger/journalist upon which she could unload her “ire?” After all it’s not like people who hate Palin aren’t a dime-a-dozen.\nAnnI think you've got this one wrong.\nShe showed up at an open restaurant for dinner, she wasn't at their wedding. They seemed to have come out to see her and been happy she was there. So I would say no. Not at all.\nYou got upstaged from that article?Seriously???\nPalin is upstaging everyone lately.The Bride had made plans for her reception. And the plans had to be adjusted on the spot.She was able to do the adult thing without pouting about changes made to her plan. Many people do that well.If she is married to a Marine, she had better get used to doing that.\nAgreed...and I'm sure she loved every minute of it.\nBREAKING !!!!Palin takes deep breath.Sucks air out of room.Women and children suffer most. Details at eleven.\n\"She was able to do the adult thing without pouting about changes made to her plan. Many people do that well.\"I lay a bet of a bottle of nice whiskey she had no urge to pout at all.\nIs that the memory the woman was hoping to lock into her permanent memory?There are a lot worse memories that happen at wedding receptions to lock into your memory. (Your bridesmaid or best man passing out or falling down drunk for one. Embarrassing fighting between the in-laws.)Perhaps they didn't vote for Obambi (unlike some people who refuse to admit that they made a terrible mistake) and they were THRILLED to see someone who represents their viewpoint and presents real hope for freedom and a change in our oppressive government. Or they were just happy to see a celebrity that they admire in their general vicinity.If Obama came to MY wedding, or any other event in my life, THAT would certainly be a horrific memory.It isn't like Palin said. \"Hey, here is a wedding. Let's crash it!!!\". It was more like. \"I'm getting something to eat and there happened to be a wedding nearby and they wanted me to take a photo with them. You betcha.\"\n\"As word of her appearance spread throughout the restaurant, a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures.\"I don't think she planned to crash the party. And, yes, if someone told her there was a reception going on, she could have left, but it doesn't sound as if that happened.Ann Althouse said...\"The couple seemed happy about it, so yes.\"Did they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?I'll bet the assembled press would have loved to hear the bride complain about the former Governor ruining her party.\nIf another woman upstages her... it's not what that was about.AHA!!! The crux of the matter. Fear of being upstaged by another woman.Get over yourself.\nI'll give you the benefit of the doubt, and presume that you were misled into \"thinking deeply\" by the term \"Back Room.\" Like CEO-MMP, I've actually been in that restaurant. It started out as an ice-cream & burgers place. After a while they added an enclosed seating area at the back of the place. This area, called the \"Back Room,\" is actually the place where the general public goes to sit down and eat. It is not a fancy place.It's clear from the article that there were lots of other people in the Back Room at the time, none of whom was there for the wedding. The Pappas Room is completely separate.Also, it's located on a major highway and has a large parking lot, so it provides easy in-and-out for someone who gets a craving for a snack in the middle of a busy day.School must have started up again. Your're \"thinking deeply\" like a silly academic instead of a hardheaded blogger.\nFamous people should just stay home. If we want to see them we can turn on the TV. Fame has lost them the right to come and go as they please.Or public places could have a neon sign in front, maybe a star inside a circle with a diagonal line across it. If anyone in the building is having a birthday, anniversary, wedding party, or any personal celebration, the sign would light up. This will let all the famous people know not to go in and upstage someone else's life.Maybe we could put all the famous people in cages like at the zoo. They need to learn their place.\nThe article could not be clearer: Palin went to a restaurant, had no reason to know there was a wedding going on in a private room, and responded graciously and appropriately when the bride and groom sought her out.Are your lame defenses of your original post in these comments are not up to your usual high standards. Please do the right thing and admit your dislike of Palin got the better of your judgment.\n\"Here's how Palin lost me, she crashed a wedding party once, and ruined two very nice people's lives for no reason at all, except to be mean.\" -- AA\nDidn't Palin also ruin a half-marathon for a bunch of people the other day by getting in front of them?Think about it. She's got all Alaska to run around in, plus Arizona. And yet she bigfooted some innocent Iowans. I'll bet they were pissed.What a bitch.\nThey look pretty happy about it and said as much...SarahPac\nPalin is the good fairy to Cinderella. Plays into wedding mythology. As she continually draws political strength from matrimonial bonds (ie \"never thought I'd want a divorce\" in Iowa). The wedding bit came alongside widespread video of her hugging a very effeminate man. Reconciliation.\nA lot of brides might fit the description you give of an immature, spoiled brat who wants all the attention on herself, no matter what. They're known around here as \"Bridezillas,\" and while I do think young girls are encouraged to think this way by the wedding industry, I don't think most fall into that trap, once they become women. Not the ones with any hope of having a lasting marriage, anyway.It also sounds to me like you might have a particular aversion to Bridezillas (hence your own low-key, deeply personal and private marriage). But you seem to assume Bridezillas are the norm rather the exception, and thus you are here both rejecting them, and accusing Sarah Palin (a political \"Bridezilla\" herself, perhaps?) of having the temerity to run afoul of one at the same time. Knocking down two distasteful female types at the same time: A two-fer! SCORE!I think I can see the connection; but I'm not buying it, based on the article, and the obvious delight of the bride. I think drawing the conclusion you do seems more snarky than insightful.\nThe best moment this bride had! Everyone who was there will remember this moment. Even better in that it seems so spontaneous.Don't see the down side. Think it's a treat. Let alone the picture! What bride wouldn't make that picture her very own best moment, too? (Not so much if it was obama showing up, though. Not with that crowd.)\n\"I did not misread the article. The things you're pointing out were completely taken into account. I am challenging you to think more deeply.\"Oh for fuck's sake Ann quit trying to OVERTHINK everything. The answer is staring you right in the face. If you didn't reside in academia you would be forced to jettison so much of what you imagine is \"deep thinking\" and cut to the chase. That is the same deep thinking that allows you to imagine Obama is normal but proves to a person with normally functioning cognitive facilities that you are a classic example of the over-educated fool.\nAlso, since pictures of the couple with Sarah Palin were probably photographed by SarahPac's wonderful official photographer, Shealah Craighead, I bet they get a nice autographed photo with a signed inscription by the Governor.Shealah Craighead\nIn the pix at that link, the Palins look better-dressed than most of the other guests at that wedding.What? That wasn't the wedding party? That was a bunch of men in shorts and the like chowing down at a casual-dining joint? You mean to say that the bride and groom just barged in there like they owned the place and demanded a photo op?I'd better think more deeply about this whole thing.\nAnn writes headlines to get us involved!She's like the referee in a soccer match who can use her hands to throw in the ball.Then we're left to look and lurk. Or to use words. And, not because we agree. But because we're human. And, opinions vary.\nIn the phrase \"It's her day,\" the \"her\" isn't supposed to be a politician that shows up for a photo op. When the happy couple invite family and friends to come celebrate with them, the family and friends are guests at the wedding. The bride and groom, in entertaining their guests, are to make it a great day for the guests. It is nice for guests to make it a great day for the bridal couple, but the onus is on the bride and groom to make it a great day for their guests. We need to get rid of the \"It's my/our day\" mentality. It makes for some really nasty wedding stories.I was happy when my neighbor--whom I did not expect to come--attending my wedding. His being there made my day, and still lights up my memories of that day.\nPalin enters restaurant...upstages waitressSingle mother...no healthcare...tips may have sufferedOrder Soup of the Day, Daily special Patty Melt upstaged, sales suffer..Think deeply what a horrible, horrible women she is....\nWaiting now for the \"You people just don't get my humor\" part of the thread.Should be arriving in about 15 more comments.\nOh, shame, Ann. It's not like she crashed the wedding. The Marine and his wife approached her, from what I read, and she 'put down her waffle,' so to speak, and obliged them. There's some as would have whined about it You angling for a media job?\nDon't see any upstaging.\nHe is a Marine, so of course they are thrilled. Palin respects our military and loves America, and I am sure this couple would prefer her to be his CIC than Obama who holds nothing but contempt for our armed services.\nThe bait seems to have been taken.\nI am challenging you to think more deeply.I think all of us did think \"more deeply\" about it. The consensus is that you're the one who's off base.Sorry about that.\nOK, I've thought more deeply about this. Althouse is right. Here's how this plays out:1. Palin enters restaurant for snack.2. Excitement spreads among crowd in state where it is well known she has no chance of winning primary. Obvious plants.3. Bride and groom leave their wedding reception to see what the hubbub's about. See Palin. Decide to cut their losses and score an autographed photo with her. These are quite rare, and likely to appreciate rapidly in value after she's trounced in the primaries.4. Ann Althouse, the famous blogger, is the only person in America to figure out what really happened. Everyone else is duped by the fake smiles of the newlyweds.5. Althouse's insight is picked up by not-so-famous bloggers Yglesias, Klein, etc.; spreads to MSM.6. Swarm of reporters descends upon newlyweds during their honeymoon in order to get the truth about this story.7. Media swarm ruins couple's honeymoon.See? Althouse is correct once again.\nDid they have much choice? How could the bride have expressed unhappiness in this situation?9/6/11 9:04 AM Ann Althouse said...I did not misread the article. The things you're pointing out were completely taken into account. I am challenging you to think more deeply.9/6/11 9:05 AMYeah Ann. You are thinking deeply...as in bottom dragging. How could the bride express displeasure? How about by opening her mouth and saying so? Did Sarah show up wearing a white gown or something? Yes you can be gracious and still express your feelings on your wedding day. My guess is Sarah Palin showing up at this wedding was like Johnny Fontaine showing up at the wedding in the Godfather. A coup for the bride, not an over shaddowing. Are you suggesting that if they were displeased, they would not have hesitated to say: \"Sarah Palin crashed our wedding!\" They sought her out and were thrilled by it (because they like Sarah Palin). Obviously if they did not like her, then things would have been different.\nThe bride looks thrilled! She could be faking it, but I doubt it--the kind of woman who would marry a Marine is the kind of woman who likes Sarah Palin.The groom looks a little nervous in the picture. Maybe he is wondering if he just met his next Commander in Chief .\nTo add insult to injury earlier that day Palin ran a half marathon in Iowa anonymously, finishing with a time of 1:46, second in her age group. She also ran faster than all the women in the age group below except one. She placed fifth overall among women of any age.\nAll this shows Ann is Sarah Palin can never win. She is always wrong. But ask yourself, if Barack and Michelle Obama showed up at that restaurant and the bride and groom did the same thing for them...would you have written the same post? My guess is you whould not have, but I am challenging you to think deeply.\nKurt Russell showed up when I was staying at Skydome once. Never thought I'd be upstaged by Snake Plissken but there it is.\nKurt Russell was the best man at my wedding. Actually he was not, but my best man did look sort of like Kurt Russell. Then he bedded two of the bridesmaids. And they knew about each other but both wanted him. He was coming off a divorce and feeling depressed so it perked him up. So he had a good time.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew)Then he bedded two of the bridesmaidsSimultaneously? IS there…video?Oh let me use the Garage, line, “Video, or it didn’t happen”\nGood gravy, you're serious about this, Althouse? Really?Palin probably just shouldn't leave her house anymore.\nMany brides do not have that good a time at the wedding. Too much stress to talk to everyone and few get ton enjoy the food. I always advise young ladies to elope and their moms get upset.\nAlso, are all brides completely self-obsessed narcissists, or is someone projecting a little here?I should think that a military bride, in particular, might be a bit more down-to-earth than your average Bridezilla.\nI think that Althouse is missing the big picture here.The real victim is Sheila Beermann, who drove all the way from Elk Point, SD to hopefully place first or second in the half marathon. Due to the unexpected entry of \"Sarah Heath\", poor sheila is relegated to a shameful third place in her age division.\nTypical Palin aggressive photo opp. ..Marines, new bride hottie, swank hotel. She should just stripped n pulled a 3way wit' the grunt and his new ho.\nAlso, I think the professor needs a new tag: \"Paving the way to vote for Obama again.\"\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) The Small Pathetic Voice chimes in to demonstrate why it is called the small pathetic voice…must be sad to have to come to a POPULAR blog to scream, “Look at me”.\nAh it's JoeJoe, the Small Pathetic Kissingerite. Dissent bothers you doesn't it little man. For that matter, you're too crass and irrational to understand satire. Palin's another flagwaver. Why, stand in front of harleys, with flags and marines/vets, a few hotties--and.... she's Prez material! Not. Then, that's a bit too profound for a little shyster like you to understand isn't it JoeJoe.\nOkay, I'm going to challenge the professor to think a little more deeply, too.How is a momentary photo-op able to upstage an entire wedding? How is it not still the bride's day? It's not like Palin got on the wedding table and did the watusi. She'll be in maybe one photo in the inevitable photo album, and it will be an interesting anecdote for the grandkids, nothing else.See, this is the kind of crazy Palin criticism that drives some of us up the wall.\n(The Uncredentialed, Crypto Jew) The Small Pathetic Voice might want to check out and see if anyone truly cares about its opinion…I believe its blog has NO comments (unless you count the ONE I randomly placed there), which would seem to imply that no one really cares what it thinks or says…I believe that is what drives the small voice to Althouse’s Big Front Porch so it can scream, “LOOK AT ME”\nAs a pastor who officiates many weddings I have to constantly work at not letting my charm and charisma take the spotlight off the bride on her special day. I know how Sarah must feel.\n.\"... I am challenging you to think more deeply...\"Methinks you're thinking too much into this.\n@Kensington, you're dead right. IMAO it isn't men who erected the glass ceiling. It was women stabbing other women in the back.\nAlthouse, dear, Go to the bathroom and purge. Quick! Quick! Quick! Get that kool-aid out of your system. I'm thinking deeply about this. I'm thinking ahead. Next thing to happen is that you and Palin will be standing in a garden. Palin will say, \"Let's find shelter. That looks like a nasty thundercloud heading our way.\"Althouse replies, \"Don't order me around! That's smoke from a forest fire you started.\"orA punk shoves Althouse off her bike and starts to peddle off. Palin, running the same path, tackles the thief. Althouse, laying there bleeding, screams, \"Palin, you attention hog! You knocked my water bottle out of its holder.\"Purge, Dear Althouse, purge!\nCaribou Barbie has been sent back to the Rancho de Klondike, at least virtually. The GOP pork-in-chief have given her the boot.\nI should think that a military bride, in particular, might be a bit more down-to-earth than your average Bridezilla. If I am understanding correctly from the locals and the pictures, they seem to have had their reception at some kind of chicken shack. So I don’t have her pegged as any kind of Bridezilla.\nShanna said \"...So I don’t have her pegged as any kind of Bridezilla.\"Exactly. This is kind of a weird post for this site, I think -- jr hi style sneering by the \"cool\" girl, nose held high -- and the target seems to be both traditional brides and Sarah Palin. Unless Althouse was just snickering to herself all the while she posted it, as Chip S. suggests. In which case, the target was us.This does not comfort me!\nEven if the bride were a self-absorbed twit she would have the satisfaction of knowing that it is unlikely that a famous person will show up at her friends' wedding receptions. (It's not about having the perfect wedding/reception, it's about having one that is better than your friends'.)When a friend or family member gets married, you know whose reception will get mentioned every time. It's almost as good as having your wedding dance video go viral.\nWhere's the picture? No link at the story.Truth be known, most receptions are nice but totally forgettable.\nOne of the most inane, catty, and asinine posts ever.\nAnd Professor -- you really have lost touch (I hope temporarily) with the real people.There are lots of real people out here who don't fake stuff and / or lie about everything.(PS - it was a wedding reception, not the \"wedding.\")\ntake the spotlight off the bride on her special daySo special when they've been shacking up for years and her virtue was gone long before that.And shouldn't it be \"their day\", or are women so insecure they think ensnaring a man makes them special?\n\"Think more deeply\" = come up with a plausible scenario where it would be true that the bride was upstaged.So:The news spreads throughout the restaurant that Palin is there. The marine groom hears and is all \"Oh boy, let's go meet her and get a picture!!\" The bride is feeling pretty miffed that her new husband is even able to THINK about another woman during their wedding reception. Recognizing that it would be counterproductive to make a scene just then, she deploys the same social expertise which got her to the altar in the first place and \"enthusiastically\" agrees. The poor groom won't find out how badly he screwed up until he is reminded on their first anniversary, and second, and third ....\nShanna: they seem to have had their reception at some kind of chicken shackThanks to Google and Google Maps, you can see what this place looks like for yourself. And while I am a fan of church basement receptions, I'd say that this place looks like a proper place for a wedding reception. (And you can have the wedding there, too.) Hardly a \"chicken shack\" by any stretch of the imagination.\nFact is, Althouse lost all credibility when it comes to Palin.Don't bother to post anything more about her-If you need to know what Althouse's take on anything Palin is in the future, tune into Rachael Maddow.This is quite troublesome-\nRAF..apparently 'think more deeply' means 'recaitulate stock plot from failed ABC sitcom...'\nThanks for the link Peter, it looks like the kind of place we would like and Manchester NH is only about 20 minutes North of here.\nAnn, come on, all your 'picturings' would be thrown out of any court as assuming facts not in evidence, let alone a John Edwards level of channeling. We get you don't like Palin but we can watch Bill Maherfor this...\n@Richard Mcenroe: So I probably should have scattered some LOLs throughout for the laugh track?wv, I kid you not: chunt. Absolutely no comment, at all, ever!\n\"think more deeply\"??Sorry, perfesser, but sometimes a cigar is simply a cigar...\nAlways the Bride of Wackedenstein, never a Bride. Poor Saraw\nSomeday the history of how and why the Republican Party, once the party of sane fiscal policy and non intervention, decided to tack to the far right and become the party of the wacko, will be written and I am sure a whole chapter will be devoted to the fascination so many have for this no talent, intellectually challenged, loud mouthed whack job. I know she drives the Left nuts, because even they are amazed that anyone, even on the Right, would take her seriously but really? This idiot? LOL Good luck running her for anything folks.\nFriend of mine was at a wedding when Meir Kahane showed up, with bodyguards. Says he went to a lot of effort to remain unnoticed.\nPragmatist wrote: \"...the fascination so many have for this no talent, intellectually challenged, loud mouthed whack job.

They are the dumb people like Sarah Palin actually believe in the future of the USA and will fight for it.Will she give up? I doubt it.She is the dumb Scots-Irish redneck of her day similar to Andrew Jackson who was the dumb redneck of 1828.\nI am challenging you to think more deeply.So if I don't agree with you, I'm not thinking deeply enough?That's pretty arrogant, Althouse.The title of your post is not justified by anything at all in the article. This is NYT- or AP- level dishonesty.The fact that most of us disagree with you doesn't necessarily make us right. At the same time, \"If everyone around you says you're drunk, you should sit down.\"\nObviously @Althouse has bought into the Bridezilla reality tv show version of the wedding and the brides out of control narcissim that reflects today's society.Personally, I'm hoping we're raising young women that have a better sense of themselves and what makes their marriage commitment significant beyond a surprise celebrity/politician showing up, the most expensive dress or food. The young women I'm talking about are cut from Sarah Palin's cloth, they are the highest number of women in congress today and they define themselves outside of the box. I've had the pleasure of spending some very brief time with Sarah Palin and seeing her in person reacting to those around her. She would be the first person to embrace that young bride and lift her up...not being of the progressive left's eat our own sister variety. Sarah is secure in herself and she passes that on to everyone around her. That's why so many common folk love her...she's not put herself on a pedastal.\nHardly a \"chicken shack\" by any stretch of the imagination. Somebody above said they were known for their chicken fingers and you have to admit the Palin pictures did not showcase a fancy venue.\nraf -- and maybe make the husband a fat lout who's always wrong...\nI haven't seen a shellacking like this bad since I tried to refinish the dining room table.\nIt sounds like Palin was in the public area and the wedding party had their reception in a separate area and they came out to see her when they heard she was there.I'm not sure \"upstages\" really applies, at least not the part that suggests bad manners.\nI am outraged by Palin's rude behavior and have decided to vote the straight Democratic ticket next year in retaliation.\nAnne, did you hit your again like when you voted for the Empty Suit?The article stated she came for the chicken fingers and they were in a different room.So showing up for chicken fingers at a restaurant is now somehow showing up a bride?Has the Palin hysteria gotten to you too?\nAlthouse, you can be obtuse often but this is just idiocy.\nSo how about it, Althouse? How good are you with, \"Maybe I did go overboard there\"? Humility is an attractive trait. Sarah knows this.\nAs word of her appearance spread throughout the restaurant, a U.S. Marine and his new bride enjoying their wedding reception in the Pappas Room asked to get some pictures. The newlyweds now had another reason to grin from ear to ear as they were overheard saying “we’ll never forget that Sarah Palin came to our wedding”.Looks like they came to her and asked to get some pictures.\nprairie wind said... So how about it, Althouse? How good are you with, \"Maybe I did go overboard there\"? Humility is an attractive trait.Not a chance.\nAllen is right, and it's a credibility hit for our host.

{"text": "Israel (מדינת ישראל) is a small yet diverse Middle Eastern country with a long coastline on the eastern Mediterranean Sea and a small window on the Red Sea at the Gulf of Eilat (Aqaba).\nIsrael was established as a state for the the Jewish people, following the Second World War. Israel is considered part of the Holy Land (together with areas of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Territories). The three major monotheistic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—all have historical ties to the region. Israel thus contains a vibrant modern history and culture, based in part on the diverse, immigrant origins of its inhabitants returning from the Jewish Diaspora. These aspects make Israel a fascinating destination for many travellers and pilgrims.\nFor Singaporeans, many of us have a warped perception of Israel as a dangerous place to visit because of the frequent news reports of conflicts in the Middle East. When I told my friends and family that I was travelling to Israel, the most common comment I get from those who have not been there is that I should be very careful for my safety.\nThe worries are unnecessary.\nI had a great one week stay at Israel, thanks to the wonderful team from Dig Israel who hosted me there. For the uninformed, Israel is a safe place to visit (excluding the West Bank and Gaza Strip which are not tourist destinations). It is like many other cosmopolitan cities around the world, but with it’s own quirk, diverse culture and people. I will share more about my Israel trip in my subsequent blog posts.\nThis post is to share some travel tips for Singaporeans who are planning to visit Israel on your own without going through a package tour:\n1. Israeli currency – New Israel Shekel\nThis currency is not easily available outside of Israel, but fret not, you can go to any money changer in Israel to do the exchange. There are counters available at the airport too, but the service fee or “commission” they charged are quite steep (about S$10+ depending on how much you change). The fee varies from one money changer to another, hence get a few quotes before settling on one to change. The fee charged is a flat fee, hence try to change as much currency as you need just once.\n2. Singaporean Passport\nIf you are holding a Malaysian passport, sorry, you cannot enter Israel. For Singapore passport holders, we do not require a visa. However, request for the Israeli custom officers to stamp on a special piece of immigration paper available at Israel airport instead of stamping directly on your passport. This is because an Israel passport chop may cause difficulties getting into and/or be refused visas to Islamic countries, such as Bangladesh, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan for your subsequent travels.\n3. Clearing Israel Custom\nThe security check is really tight when travelling to Israel. I find it fair enough as it is for our own safety too. You will be asked some profiling questions at the luggage check-in counter travelling to and from Israel. Some of the questions may get a little personal – eg. I was asked questions like why did I only took leave from work one week before my trip; asked to recount my day by day itinerary during my stay in Israel; went through some of my personal photos in my digital camera to check if what I said about my itinerary was true; reasons why I travelled to Malaysia since I been there twice this year and also whether I know anyone there. The questioning may take quite a while and will make some people uncomfortable. My advice is just to answer as honestly as possible if you have nothing to hide. Do not lie to speed up the questioning as they are very thorough and you may end up having to tell another lie to cover a previous harmless lie, increasing the chance of being exposed as a liar and getting detained. You will get to fly. Be patient.\nDo not take stuff like soil from Jerusalem and salt from the Dead Sea to pack home on your own. All baggage going out of Israel are screened and opened up for checking. Do not pull stunts like these. Do not take photographs of the security counter and officers either.\nThe ultra-orthodox Jews are easily identifiable with their curly side burns, black suits and tassels. Tourists like to take pictures of them because of their interesting appearance which we are not familiar with. However, do bear in mind that they are not animals in the zoo and as much as you would get pissed off with strangers taking random pictures of you, they feel the same way too. Do accord them due respect and try not intrude in their personal space.\n6. The Sabbath\nBe aware of the Sabbath: from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown, train and bus services are not available in Israel (except in Haifa, Nazareth and Eilat, and limited sherut services – shared taxis). Unless you have a car, or are willing to pay for a taxi (not shared), if you’re day tripping on a Friday, you should start thinking about how to get back by noon at the latest, and you should plan on staying near your lodgings on Saturday. Attractions, shops and malls are also closed during the Sabbath. I made the mistake of staying for an additional day in Tel Aviv during the Sabbath and ended up wandering the streets alone with nothing to see or do. I also had to specially advance book a taxi to the airport.\n7. Gay and Lesbian Travel\nIsrael is one of the most “gay friendly” countries in the world. Seriously. All three major cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa) have an annual “Pride” parade, and the annual Love Parade in Tel Aviv gets cheering spectators too. Look out for many hotels, cafes and restaurants with rainbow flags hanging outside. These are all gay-friendly places.\nIsrael is not a cheap country. I find it more expensive than Sydney and the United States in terms of food, lodging and shopping. On average, a meal cost around S$20 for a simple meal at a cafe. A bottle of 500ml water cost around S$5. Taxi from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv one way cost about S$100.\nStreet food is safe and clean. Israeli cuisine is as diverse as the population which makes up this gastronomic country. Food in Israel is generally of a very high standard. I really enjoyed the food during my stay. Not tipping in sit-in restaurants that have waiters is frowned upon, but is accepted for signalling atrocious service. It is standard to give 10%-15% (or more for exceptional service). 20% tip is considered generous.\nHebrew and Arabic are the official languages of Israel. Hebrew is most commonly spoken. 20% of the population are Israeli-Arabs who speak Arabic as well. English is the most popular foreign language.

{"text": "Nuclear Energy in France\nNuclear energy is the cornerstone of french energy policy. In the ‘70s France chose to develop nuclear as its base load electricity source as a response to the oil crisis and assure its energy independence.\nNuclear Electricity Production: France currently counts 58 commercial nuclear reactors in operation responsible for producing 80% of French domestic electricity. As a comparison, the 104 US reactors produces 20% of US electricity.Despite scarce natural resources, France has reached an energy independence of 50% thanks to its strategic choice for nuclear energy.\nEnvironment: As well as providing safe and reliable energy, nuclear helps to reduce French greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the release of 31 billions tones of carbon dioxide (contrary to coal or gas generation) and making France the less carbon emitting country within the OECD. As a leader in nuclear energy, France has developed clean technology for radioactive waste disposal. Reprocessing currently allows France to recover valuable elements from spent fuels and permit a significant reduction of high level waste and lead to safer and optimized containment, for final radioactive waste disposition. French nuclear power plants produces only 10 g/year/inhabitant of highly radioactive waste.\nInternational Cooperation and research: France is one of the forerunner in nuclear research and participates in numerous international cooperation programs alongside the United States such as the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants (Gen IV) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) that will be built in Cadarache, South of France.\nThe French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)\nThe French Atomic Energy Commission is a public body established in October 1945 by General de Gaulle. It constitutes a power of expertise and proposition for the authorities. A leader in research, development and innovation, the CEA is involved in three main fields:\nIt develops and acquires the technological building blocks necessary to the development of the nuclear reactors of the future (Contribution to Generation IV and GNEP research),\nIt contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emission with its research on hydrogen, fuel cells, biomass, energy storage…,\nIt supports the nuclear utilities in France by optimizing the nuclear power plants of the French nuclear fleet and by optimizing the fuel cycle,\nIt offers safe and economically viable technical solutions for managing nuclear waste,\nIt conducts fundamental research in climate and environmental sciences, high energy physics, astrophysics, fusion, nanosciences…\nInformation and Health technologies:\nIt tackles micro and nano-technologies for telecommunication and nuclear medicine for radiotherapy and medical imaging,\nIt researches programs on biotechnology, molecular labelling, biomolecular engineering and structural biology,\nIt shares its knowledge and know-how through education and training through the National Institute for Nuclear Sciences and Technologies (INSTN),\nIt manages over 300 priority patents and is active in the creation of clusters.\nDefense and National Security:\nIt conceives, builds, maintains then dismantles the nuclear warhead of the French deterrence force,\nIt helps to fight against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons (NRBC program).\nThe missions of the CEA are similar to the Department of Energy in the United States. The CEA has a network of counselor or representatives in French Embassies around the world (see joint map).\nThe French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN)\nCreated in 2006, from the former DSIN (Directorate for the Safety of Nuclear Facilities), the French Nuclear Safety Authority is an independent administrative authority which is tasked with regulating nuclear safety and radiation protection in order to protect workers, patients, the public and the environment from the risks involved in nuclear activities. It also contributes to informing the public. Like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, it carries out inspections and may pronounce sanctions, up to and including suspension of operation of an installation.\nFrench Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)\nCreated in 2001 by merging the Protection and Nuclear Safety Institute (IPSN) and the Ionizing radiations Protection Office (OPRI), the Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety is a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature placed under the joint authority of the Ministries of the Environment, Health, Industry, Research and Defense. It is the expert in safety research and specialized assessments into nuclear and radiological risk serving public authorities whose work is complementary to the ASN.\nIts scope of activities includes:\nenvironment and response,\nhuman radiological protection,\nresearch on the prevention of major accidents,\npower reactor safety,\nfuel cycle facility safety,\nresearch installation safety,\nwaste management safety;\nnuclear defense expertise.\nNational radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA)\nCreated in 1991, the French National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management is a public industrial and commercial organization that operates independently of waste producers. It is responsible for the long-term management of radioactive waste produced in France under the supervision of the French Ministries for Energy, Research and the Environment. It can be compared to a certain extent to the Office for Nuclear Waste of the Department of Energy in the United States.\nAndra also pursues industrial, research, and information activities as it designs and implements disposal solutions suited to each category of radioactive waste:\nthe collection, conditioning, disposal of radioactive waste from small producers (hospitals, research centers, industry),\nspecification of waste packages for disposal,\ndisposal in suited sites,\nmonitoring of closed disposal facilities,\nresearch programs for long-lived and high level activity waste, especially through the operation of an underground research laboratory in a deep clay formation…\nGeneral Directorate for Energy and Climate (DGEC)\nThe General Directorate for Energy and Climate represents the government and is part of the Office of the Department for Ecology and Sustainable Development. It defines the French nuclear policy. The DGEC takes care of the energy supply, the security of supply, oil refining and logistics, nuclear industry, and coal and mines.\nConsequently, its activities include:\nthe design and implement energy and raw material supply policy,\nto ensure opening of electricity and gas markets,\ntrack key energy and raw material sectors,\nto oversee enterprises and public institutions in energy sector,\nto ensure compliance with rules and regulations governing energy sector,\nto participate in European and international energy projects and working groups,\nto provide economic, environmental, and fiscal expertise on energy matters.\nThe Rise of Nuclear Power Generation in France.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f5c220a7-7276-4cf2-9208-33679d478b1f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article949&xtor=AL-13", "date": "2013-05-18T06:33:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9123350381851196, "token_count": 1305, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Mexican America - Introduction\n\"Mexican America\" is a sampling of objects from the collections of the National Museum of American History. The stories behind these objects reflect the history of the Mexican presence in the United States. They illustrate a fundamentally American story about the centuries-old encounter between distinct (yet sometimes overlapping) communities that have coexisted but also clashed over land, culture, and livelihood.\nWho, where, and what is Mexico? Over time, the definitions and boundaries of Mexico have changed. The Aztec Empire and the area where Náhautl was spoken—today the region surrounding modern Mexico City—was known as Mexico. For 300 years, the Spanish colonizers renamed it New Spain.\nWhen Mexico was reborn in 1821 as a sovereign nation, its borders stretched from California to Guatemala. It was a huge and ancient land of ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse regions that struggled for national unity. Texas, (then part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas) was a frontier region far from the dense cities and fertile valleys of central Mexico, a place where immigrants were recruited from the United States. The immigrants in turn declared the Mexican territory an independent republic in 1836 (later a U.S. state), making the state the first cauldron of Mexican American culture. By 1853, the government of Mexico, the weaker neighbor of an expansionist United States, had lost what are today the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. In spite of the imposition of a new border, the historical and living presence of Spaniards, Mexicans, indigenous peoples, and their mixed descendants remained a defining force in the creation of the American West.\n“La América Mexicana” es una muestra conformada por objetos provenientes de las distintas colecciones del Museo Nacional de Historia Americana. Estos objetos reflejan la historia de la presencia mexicana en los Estados Unidos e ilustran una crónica fundamentalmente americana acerca del encuentro centenario entre comunidades diferentes que han coexistido, pero que también se han enfrentado, en la pugna por la tierra, la cultura y el sustento.\n¿Quién, dónde y qué es México? Con el transcurso del tiempo, las definiciones y los límites de México han ido cambiando. Se conocía como México al Imperio Azteca y toda el área donde se hablaba náhuatl —actualmente la región circundante a la ciudad de México. Durante 300 años los colonizadores españoles se refirieron a ella como Nueva España. Cuando en 1821 México resurgió como una nación soberana, sus fronteras se extendían desde California a Guatemala. En ese entonces era un antiguo e inmenso territorio conformado por regiones étnica, lingüística y económicamente diversas que luchaban por adquirir unidad nacional. Texas (en ese entonces parte de los estados mexicanos de Coahuila y Tejas) era una región fronteriza lejos de las densas urbes y de los fértiles valles de México central, donde se reclutaban inmigrantes de los Estados Unidos. En el año 1836 este territorio mexicano se declaró como república independiente (y más tarde, estado de EE.UU.), convirtiéndose en el primer calderón de la cultura mexicoamericana. Hacia 1853, el gobierno de México, el vecino débil de un Estados Unidos en expansión, había perdido el territorio de los actuales estados de California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas y partes de Colorado y Wyoming. A pesar de la imposición de un nuevo límite fronterizo, la presencia histórica y ocupacional de los españoles, mexicanos y pueblos indígenas, junto a sus descendientes mestizos, constituiría a lo largo del tiempo una influencia determinante para el desarrollo del Oeste Americano.\n\"Mexican America - Introduction\" showing 1 items.\n- This print depicts American forces attacking the fortress palace of Chapultepec on Sept. 13th, 1847. General Winfield Scott, in the lower left on a white horse, led the southern division of the U.S. Army that successfully captured Mexico City during the Mexican American War. The outcome of American victory was the loss of Mexico's northern territories, from California to New Mexico, by the terms set in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. It should be noted that the two countries ratified different versions of the same peace treaty, with the United States ultimately eliminating provisions for honoring the land titles of its newly absorbed Mexican citizens. Despite notable opposition to the war from Americans like Abraham Lincoln, John Quincy Adams, and Henry David Thoreau, the Mexican-American War proved hugely popular. The United States' victory boosted American patriotism and the country's belief in Manifest Destiny.\n- This large chromolithograph was first distributed in 1848 by Nathaniel Currier of Currier and Ives, who served as the \"sole agent.\" The lithographers, Sarony & Major of New York (1846-1857) copied it from a painting by \"Walker.\" Unfortunately, the current location of original painting is unknown, however, when the print was made the original painting was owned by a Captain B. S. Roberts of the Mounted Rifles. The original artist has previously been attributed to William Aiken Walker as well as to Henry A. Walke. William Aiken Walker (ca 1838-1921) of Charleston did indeed do work for Currier and Ives, though not until the 1880's and he would have only have been only 10 years old when this print was copyrighted. Henry Walke (1808/9-1896) was a naval combat artist during the Mexican American War who also worked with Sarony & Major and is best known for his Naval Portfolio.\n- Most likely the original painting was done by James Walker (1819-1889) who created the \"Battle of Chapultepec\" 1857-1862 for the U.S. Capitol. This image differs from the painting commissioned for the U. S. Capitol by depicting the troops in regimented battle lines with General Scott in a more prominent position in the foreground. James Walker was living in Mexico City at the outbreak of the Mexican War and joined the American forces as an interpreter. He was attached to General Worth's staff and was present at the battles of Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. The original painting's owner, Captain Roberts was assigned General Winfield Scott to assist Walker with recreating the details of the battle of Chapultepec. When the painting was complete, Roberts purchased the painting. By 1848, James Walker had returned to New York and had a studio in New York City in the same neighborhood as the print's distributor Nathaniel Currier as well as the lithographer's Napoleon Sarony and Henry B. Major.\n- This popular lithograph was one of several published to visually document the war while engaging the imagination of the public. Created prior to photography, these prints were meant to inform the public, while generally eliminating the portrayal of the more gory details. Historians have been able to use at least some prints of the Mexican War for study and to corroborate with the traditional literary forms of documentation. As an eyewitness, Walker could claim accuracy of detail within the narrative in his painting. The battle is presented in the grand, historic, heroic style with the brutality of war not portrayed. The print depiction is quite large for a chromo of the period. In creating the chromolithographic interpretation of the painting, Sarony & Major used at least four large stones to produce the print \"in colours,\" making the most of their use of color. They also defined each figure with precision by outlining each in black. This print was considered by expert/collector Harry T. Peters as one of the finest ever produced by Sarony & Major.\n- Currently not on view\n- Date made\n- associated date\n- Currier, Nathaniel\n- Scott, Winfield\n- Sarony & Major\n- Walker, James\n- ID Number\n- catalog number\n- accession number\n- Data Source\n- National Museum of American History, Kenneth E.

{"text": "American Printer's mission is to be the most reliable and authoritative source of information on integrating tomorrow's technology with today's management.\nJul 1, 2006 12:00 AM\nFollowing the recent release of QuarkXPress 7, graphic arts managers and other technology decisionmakers are asking two primary questions:\nQuark has revamped its previously troubled color management system with some success. There are four fundamental changes:\nCommand central for QuarkXPress 7’s color management is\nthe Color Manager, located in Preferences. Whether it is good to\nalways have color management on can (and will be) argued both ways.\nFor savvy production color users, it’s probably a good thing,\nas ultimately it forces us to make color decisions that we should\nbe making anyway. For those with limited color experience, the\nquality and consequences of the QuarkXPress 7 default settings will\ndetermine the output results. Learn how to config-ure the source\nand output settings (Edit menu) and apply them through the Color\nManager (Preferences) and/or the Job Jackets Manager (more on this\nThe source/output setting separation is a welcome change. Users can control specifically which color profiles and rendering intents will be used for viewing and converting the color in your images. For many this will involve using the same profiles and intents used elsewhere, such as in Adobe Photoshop. You also have access to the same color system-stored profiles as those accessed in Photoshop, as well as the Quark-specific profiles stored in Quark’s application folder. If you pay attention, you should be able to keep your color consistent as you move your images through QuarkXPress.\nFor those of you anxiously wondering about using your previous color settings that you know how to print, breathe easy. You can select QuarkXPress Emulate Legacy for your source and Output settings, and ColorSync or ICM for your color management module (CMM), if you want to just pass the old values through. The most obvious opening for color divergence is if you convert colors through QuarkXPress using a CMM different than one you use elsewhere.\nThe third major color management change is Quark’s\nadoption of LogoSync CMM. The CMM is the engine that actually\nhandles the conversion of the color values from one color profile\nspace to another color profile space. Using LogoSync is an overall\nimprovement, but it has built-in limitations, as well. Switching\nfrom OS-based ColorSync or ICM to LogoSync (for the default CMM) is\na good move for two reasons. First, using LogoSync provides more\ncross-platform compatibility not available when ColorSync was used\non the Mac. Second, ICM is used in Windows. The limitations of both\nColorSync and ICM are widely acknowledged, so other CMMs have been\nadopted widely. LogoSync (developed with GretagMacbeth) is an\nacknowledged high quality CMM. The inherent limitation of using\nLogoSync is that it currently is not widely used. In print\nproduction the most widely used CMM is the Adobe (ACE) CMM. There\nare those who argue LogoSync is a better CMM than Adobe (ACE) CMM.\nEven if this is true, it is largely irrelevant to the discussion of\nconsistency. And there is little Quark can do about this, as it\ndoes not have access to the Adobe (ACE) CMM. So until either Adobe\nreleases its Adobe (ACE) CMM for third-party use or another CMM\n(such as LogoSync) becomes the commonly used standard, this\ninconsistency in color conversion will exist. How visible the\ndifferences in the conversion results will be will depend upon the\nimages, color profiles and rendering intents used.\nBypass color conversion problems by performing the conversions in another application (such as Adobe Photoshop) and assigning the same color profiles for Source and Output in QuarkXPress that you have in Photoshop.\nThe other major change—a good oneis the ability to soft proof nondestructively using color profiles and rendering intents. Quark’s soft proofing is similar to InDesign’s soft proofing with a View menu Output Control. Also like InDesign, QuarkXPress now lets users view and change image-specific color profile and rendering intent via Window > Profile information.\nSo what’s the bottom line? Here are my conclusions:\nOne caveat: This .psd import capability doesn’t seem to work well with layers modified by Photoshop CS2 Layer Styles. When I imported a CS2 .psd image containing layer styles, I consistently received an error message indicating that layer effects were not supported. But when this occurred, the .psd image still was imported and access and editing still was provided to those layers and channel components that were supported. (Perhaps the PSD Import feature was developed and tested with CS1 images.)\nPicture effects provide for a variety of picture editing tools, including curves, sharpening, blurring and many more. Once applied, these effects adjustments can be stored and reused. I remain a staunch supporter of making these corrections directly in an image editing application such as Photoshop. Nonetheless, this could be a time-saving production tool when working with client files whose images all need the same amount of lightening or sharpening. You could apply the effect once, record that adjustment and then apply it to as many other images as are required.\nYou even can share picture effects files. InDesign does not offer a similaralry powerful image-editing tool. Picture Effects currently does not work with Photoshop images, a frustrating mismatch with the .psd import function.\nKeyboard shortcuts are a mixed bag. QuarkXPress historically has provided the more logical and elegant keyboard shortcut sets and sequences. Its use of the “M” series as well as its control of type size, tracking, kerning and leading still is the best around. But InDesign now offers a custom dialog (Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts) that allows you to assign your own keyboard shortcuts, reassign others, create sets of shortcuts and even use QuarkXPress and PageMaker shortcuts. Quark still has the fundamentally superior set of shortcuts, but it is resting on its laurels. InDesign offers an increasing number of shortcuts common to multiple CS applications, so it’s a tie in this category.\nMeasurements palette vs. control palette\nThe enhanced measurements palette is the most immediately obvious interface change in QuarkXPress 7. It has a new context-sensitive pop-up subpalette that offers many of the control features previously found only in other dialogs and palettes.\nThis is Quark’s answer to InDesign’s multifaceted control palettes.The new measurement palette is well designed and easier to decipher than InDesign’s implementation of a context-sensitive palette. If you just don’t like any of this context-sensitive sophistication, click on the Quark logo icon on the far left of the pop-up palette, and you will see your familiar old measurement palette.\nMaster pages, style sheets, text import and\nNo important changes have been made to master pages or style sheets in version 7. InDesign remains master of those realms.\nIn addition, InDesign offers multiple baseline grids (through text frame baselines) and boasts a complete and sophisticated Word document import feature for controlling the import, autoformatting and appending of style sheets from Word and .rtf documents, which QuarkXPress still lacks.\nOutput styles vs. print presets\nQuark has one-upped Adobe in the print styles category, where Quark’s print style was roughly equivalent to InDesign’s Print Presets. QuarkXPress’ new output style (Edit > Output Styles) is like print styles on steroids—it includes resolution-specific transparency flattening, metadata and JDF info, as well as standard print dialog settings.\nOutput styles have three initial default setups for PDF, Print and EPS (whose settings now include the ability to embed font files in EPS files). Output styles can be shared and are integrated into the powerful job jackets function, as well.\nQuarkXPress 7 has stuck with JAWS as its PDF Export function. While Quark has done extensive testing with the new and improved version of JAWS, I remain unconvinced of the consistent usability of JAWS-generated PDFs in prepress. (Besides, it is slower than molasses flowing in January.) I still recommend printing PostScript from QuarkXPress to Distiller-watched folders for generating prepress-bound PDFs. Again Adobe has an inherent advantage, because it owns PDF and Distiller. Quark does provide an easy and Preference-selectable avenue to PostScript and Distiller.\nOne of Quark’s most comprehensive and sophisticated new production tools is the implementation of job jackets, including the Job Jackets Manager (Utilities > Job Jackets Manager). Job jackets are complete descriptions of all—and I mean ALL—the characteristics of a job. Jobs can be defined at three levels:\nOnce defined, job jackets can be used in multiple ways. A job\njacket can be used to create a new job using all the predefined\ncharacteristics of that job jacket (File > New > Project From\nTicket). Job jackets also can be used to evaluate an existing job\n(File > Job Jacket > Evaluate Layout). This job evaluation\namounts to a sophisticated preflighting tool that allows you to\nlook for a wide range of intimate project and component\ncharacteristics, such as image resolution, file format, image color\nspace and attached color profiles. QuarkXPress documents also can\nbe output using job jackets or tickets. Instead of selecting File\n> Print, you can choose to define and control your output via\nthe job jacket by selecting File > Output Job, selecting a\nspecific set of output specifications defined in a ticket template,\nincluding previously created output styles. InDesign doesn’t\noffer this powerful production tool.\nNow for a reality check: The good news is that the job jacket function is robust, full-featured and highly integrated into QuarkXPress 7; the bad news is that the job jacket function has a complex and somewhat quirky (non-QuarkXPress-like) interface that is difficult to learn. I see this function initially being configured by print shop techies who will then train larger clients to use them.\nThe bottom line\nIf you are a QuarkXPress user, I think you will be delighted with version 7 and I recommend upgrading. Keep a copy of 6.5 available, too. I also recommend installing QuarkXPress 7 first on a test system partition or drive identical to your working system, as a precaution, to ensure the installation process does not cause any unexpected system problems. The bottom line: QuarkXPress 7 is a welcome update with some very powerful new tools and features.\nTalk to the hand\nWhenever I am working in QuarkXPress, I love that I don’t have to remember which of the two keyboard shortcuts I am supposed to use (depending upon whether I am working with an active text tool or not) for accessing the hand tool.\nIf I were king of Adobe, that is the first thing I would fix: One keyboard shortcut for accessing the hand tool! Then, while I was at it, I would change the names of the two selection tools to “object” and “content” tools.\nSo long to PostScript?\nBy Julie Shaffer\nThe Adobe PDF Print Engine is a new printing platform (a.k.a. RIP) that directly renders PDF files. Many print/prepress workflow solutions on the market today are based on Adobe CPSI RIP technology, which is built on PostScript. Even solutions that use PDF as an internal working file format, such as Kodak Prinergy, Agfa Apogee and Heidelberg PrintReady, still convert those PDF files to PostScript prior to actual imaging.\nBut PostScript 3 was introduced in 1997. It can’t natively render some newer effects, like transparency, which have become design mainstays. Transparency has to be flattened prior to introducing it to PostScript and, depending on how and where this flattening is done, the results can look terrible. Adobe’s PDF Print Engine eliminates all such problems because it renders those PDF files natively.\nThe technology also incorporates JDF information for job control, so it will fit nicely into the “end-to-end” workflow solutions.\nAdobe still will support PostScript—it won’t suddenly vanish. But the next evolution is here.\nFor further reading\nJay Nelson offers an excellent comprehensive review of QuarkXPress 7’s new features at: www.creative pro.com:80/story/review/24327.html?origin=story.\nTaz Tally is a digital imaging author, speaker and photographer.

{"text": "Few things have been more poorly understood about the Obama administration than its foreign policy. Partisan and ideological blinders have tended to obscure and distort how critics and supporters have interpreted his policy decisions and his reactions to events around the world. More hawkish interventionists have fixated on Obama’s diplomatic overtures to authoritarian states, his condemnation of Manuel Zelaya’s deposition, and his slightly firmer line on Israeli settlements as proof of weakness and perfidy, while realists and liberals have great confidence that the same represents a significant positive departure from past policy, but both are finding more in these moves than is really there. This has led to a number of misconceptions about how to classify the Obama administration’s foreign policy inclinations, and it has created confusion in how we should judge the administration’s performance in improving relations with much of the rest of the world.\nWhat continues to confuse observers on both sides is the remarkable—or perhaps depressing—continuity between the Obama and Bush administrations in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, which is usually acknowledged only when it suits the rhetorical purposes of an argument. Critics and supporters alike would rather emphasize a dialectical relationship between the two administrations in which Obama is the antithesis of Bush for good or ill, which permits discredited neoconservative interventionists to describe any Obama failures as the repudiation of realism, their traditional bête noire, and allows realists and liberals to rediscover the virtues of U.S. hegemony by confusing change in management with change in policy.\nThis continuity necessarily thwarts any attempt to find a consistent theme or pattern to the administration’s actions, and it renders criticisms of a lack of consistency moot. That has not stopped critics from trying to find grand, unifying explanations of Obama’s actions, such as perceiving a “pro-dictator,” “anti-democratic,” or “anti-American” pattern in Obama’s responses to the Honduran constitutional crisis and Iranian elections, but these are unsupported claims. No administration will ever pursue any policy with anything like perfect consistency, and Obama’s predecessor was no exception, so we should expect the same consistency or lack thereof from an administration that has largely followed in its predecessor’s footsteps. Indeed, the difficulty of pursuing a policy consistently draws more attention to the flaws of the policy than to an undesirable lack of consistency.\nNo matter how idealistic and ideological an administration may be, there are structures and interests that limit how any administration can act: Every ‘freedom agenda’ must have its exceptions for Arab dictators and anti-Russian demagogues, every non-proliferation regime must have its exceptions for allied nuclear states outside of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and every ‘war on terror’ must make room for or at least overlook the sponsorship of terrorism by allied governments. For that matter, there may also be longtime allies that find themselves at odds with major multilateral organizations, as the Honduran transitional government recently has, in which case Washington may end up siding with the latter as part of its regional or global “leadership” role. So a lack of consistency in administration policy by itself is neither praiseworthy nor damning—it is what the reality of international affairs imposes on even the most zealous ideologue.\nInasmuch as Wilsonian idealism has permeated both parties especially since the end of the Cold War, the criticisms that partisan opponents level at a given administration will typically be framed in terms of the administration’s failures or disinterest in promoting democracy, and the administration’s defenders will stress its overriding democratist goals. Once again, we have debates over means rather than ends. We have seen this nowhere more clearly than in the domestic reactions to Obama’s handling of the Iranian elections. Whether or not Obama’s domestic critics were genuinely interested in the plight of Iran’s reformers, whom many hawkish interventionists had previously derided as fundamentally no different from their hard-line rivals, they took up the cause of the Iranian protesters and demanded more forceful rhetoric and action from the president, who resisted calls to insert himself into what was an entirely internal Iranian matter.\nWhen Obama did not heed their calls, hawkish critics were furious about the “betrayal of democracy” that this represented. However, even as he said little and did less in response to Tehran’s crackdown, Obama wanted to emphasize that his restraint was the best means of aiding Iranian dissidents. This may be true, given past U.S. interference in domestic Iranian politics and the regime’s mockery of the protests as a phony U.S.-backed “color” revolution, but the crucial point is that Obama felt compelled to explain his restraint in these terms. More than that, his aides reportedly wanted to credit the president’s earlier speech in Cairo with sparking the apparent late surge for Moussavi as a way of emphasizing the importance of soft power in shaping public opinion. In other words, the new administration wanted it known that regime change in Tehran and democracy promotion in Muslim countries, two ideas for which the previous administration was quite properly criticized as overly ideological and detached from reality, were still very much a part of U.S. policy despite any apparent changes to the contrary.\nClassifications of foreign policy schools or inclinations are never precise, whether they are applied to the thinking of individuals or entire administrations, as most policymakers combine elements from different schools and will tend to adapt their use of diplomatic, political, and military tools to changing circumstances. As we recall from the preparation for the Iraq war and the slight shifts made during the second Bush term, even inside the Bush administration one would find conflicting views and changes in the president’s own thinking over time. It is also important to bear in mind that these classifications tend to bleed into one another in practice, which is a function of the broad bipartisan consensus about the legitimacy and necessity of the projection of American power around the world, the preservation of U.S. military and political supremacy, the promotion of liberal democratic values, and the inevitability of American global leadership. Most foreign policy debates take place within these fairly narrow boundaries, and the points of contention are questions of means rather than ends.\nThis practical blurring of lines between foreign policy schools is also the result of widely shared cultural-political convictions that Andrew Bacevich has called the “ideology of national security,” which is the belief that expanding freedom (however vaguely or loosely defined) is the purpose of history and the mission of the U.S., that American actions abroad serve this purpose, and that both American freedom and security are bound up in ensuring universal freedom. While such ideas are normally associated today with neoconservatives or “hard Wilsonian” idealists, it is fair to say that this ideology is the foundation of the bipartisan consensus just described, and most internationalists—which is to say most Americans who spend any time thinking about foreign policy—partake of it to some extent.\nObama sympathizers have fixated on superficial changes in style and tone in the hopes that they represent some significant shift in policy, and enemies have discovered proof of sinister plots in the same ultimately trivial gestures. Thus Obama’s ‘recognition’ of the Iranian government by using its formal title of Islamic Republic, or the initial gestures connected with “resetting” the relationship with Russia, or even something as unremarkable as acknowledging the American role in the overthrow of Mossadegh in 1953 are taken as powerful signals one way or the other: as exciting openings to rapprochement or pathetic instances of weakness and capitulation. As it happens, the truth is far simpler than either of these interpretations allows.\nFor all of the praise—and abuse—the administration has received for its greater realism, it clearly remains committed to halting Iran’s nuclear program by any means available and to unnecessary, provocative NATO expansion into former Soviet space, even though both policies expose the U.S. to many more costs and risks rather than fewer. For all of the talk of engagement and “reset,” the substance of our Iran and Russia policies has not changed under the new administration, and it never was going to change greatly. The administration believed that it could extract concessions and aid from these states through negotiations, but it never intended to alter its behavior toward them. The president still presumes to dictate the security and energy policies of other states, and he still insists on extending our sphere of influence to Russia’s borders in the name of eliminating spheres of influence. Whichever name one wants to give to this sort of foreign policy, it remains inexplicably aggressive, hegemonic, and dangerous to U.S. interests, and it is all the more so because it comes wrapped in a veil of diplomatic gestures and the pretense of repairing damaged relations.\nDaniel Larison is contributing editor at The American Conservative, where he blogs at Eunomia, and an online columnist for The Week.

{"text": "Route: (40I-) MGY-I19-MGY\nWeather: Overcast, 28 degrees, wind 200 degrees at 6 knots\nWith 269 landings, five months of training, nearly 75 flight hours, plenty of frustration, tons of fun, at least $6000 spent, and so many great memories behind me... I'm a Private Pilot! The weather cooperated and I went up with the examiner to complete the flying portion of my checkride, following last weekend's oral exam. Everything went well and I didn't feel any nerves aside from a little hope that I wouldn't make any boneheaded mistakes. Luckily, I did not. I am now the proud holder of a Temporary Airman Certificate, good until my plastic FAA certificate arrives in the mail.\nAs I did with the oral exam, I'll share the details of the checkride below. And make sure you read the end of the post, as I got to deal with some serious craziness when I went to leave Wright Brothers.\n- I arrived at Stewart early in order to get a weather briefing, compute my weight and balance, and make sure I had all the paperwork in order. Then I had some help in starting the plane (it takes some extra work when it's 15 degrees out at night - brr!) and I let it warm up for a couple minutes. Fuel full, I left around 12:15 and got in a few practice landings at Wright Brothers before my scheduled 1:00 appointment with the examiner. Having not practiced a no-flap landing, I made one there and it was incredibly smooth. My landings felt great last night and today, hopefully a good sign for today.\n- After a quick look through my papers, we walked out to the plane and he asked me to do a preflight as if it were the first flight of the day. I walked around the plane and made my usual inspection, mentioning what I was doing on a couple occasions but for the most part not saying much. It looked like the examiner was just looking over to make sure I checked everything important. He told me he was going to get into the little 150 when I was about 2/3 of the way through the inspection. Both in the plane, I went through the pre-start checklist and got the engine running. He told me that I was PIC (Pilot in Command) so I would be responsible for the flight and should call out all traffic to him. I ran through the CIGAR checklist on the ramp (minus the runup) and then taxied down to the runup area at the end of the runway. During the runup I called out as I checked the suction (which I do even when I fly solo) and mags \"left, drop, both, right, drop, both...\" and declared us ready to fly.\n- He asked me to make a normal takeoff and then proceed on course, which was about due East to our destination in Clarksburg, WV. The takeoff was very smooth and I got to pattern altitude and turned downwind. He asked what the heck I was doing. Crap, stupid move there. I should have departed on a 45 degree heading from the takeoff runway and instead flew downwind for some stupid reason. We do use that departure at Stewart sometimes, but honestly I just totally didn't have my brain connected. No big deal, he just explained to me the reasons for specific departures and I overflew the airport and then departed on the proper 155 degree heading. Phwew.\n- Leveling off at 3,500 feet, he said I should pitch over and build up speed before pulling back the throttle. I don't know if I was taught to throttle back while leveling off or if I just invented the habit on my own, but a good idea that I'll use in the future. We were about due South of Xenia at this point (meaning we had traveled all of 10ish miles) and he had me descend to 2,500 feet and divert to Green County Airport (I19). I know you never fly much of the cross-country you plan for the checkride, but that sure was short.\n- Using my sectional, I found the frequency for I19 and entered the pattern on a 45 degree entry. He asked for a normal landing so I set up for that, starting the descent abeam the numbers on downwind. I've heard from local pilots the winds are interesting on Runway 25 because it's at the edge of a 100 foot slope down to a road and gravel pit. I anticipated that on short final but I didn't feel much. The landing was smooth but as soon as I touched down he jerked the yoke and said to get the ailerons into the wind, which was about 4 knots and 20 degrees off the nose. Doesn't seem like much but he said a lot of pilots have had the wing get under their wings because they don't think a light crosswind can do anything. Point noted sir.\n- Short field takeoffs and landings were next. The takeoff went great and I set up for an extended downwind for the landing. He told me to name my point and I said I'd touch down on the numbers. I ended up landing within a few feet of the numbers, although it was not the smoothest touchdown in my piloting career. But I landed slow and short as required, so all was well. I departed Greene County with a soft field takeoff (went well) and we turned to the South.\n- I was instructed to pick a point to turn around and said I'd use a barn in a field below. He asked what the most important thing in starting a ground reference maneuver is. \"Enter on the downwind side?\" \"No!\" \"Uh, avoid populated areas?\" \"No!\" And so it went for a couple more things I muttered out, not sure what he wanted to hear. \"To have an available emergency landing area!\" Oh, duh. Although I guess it's never been something that was specifically discussed. Not that the first barn was in rough terrain or anything but there were other houses nearby. So I picked out a barn surrounded on all four sides by large fields and made a very smooth and otherwise uneventful turn around it. That was it for ground reference maneuvers.\n- \"Your engine just died.\" Pitch to best glide... \"What are you doing?\" \"Pitching to best glide.\" \"No! You ALWAYS PULL THE CARB HEAT FIRST!!!\" Alrighty then. I swear I was taught to always pitch down first, but his point was that the carb heat will cool down in 3-5 seconds so if you don't get it on right away there will be no heat left to help. He then proceeded to pull the power on me about 3 more times in a row to make sure I yanked that carb heat out instantly. Then he left the throttle out for good and had me descend to a field, drop the flaps to 40 degrees when clear of the barn/trees, and get down to maybe 50 feet above the ground. That's the lowest I have ever gone in a practice engine-out situation and I know I would have made a survivable landing if necessary. At this point, he took control of the plane and got us out of there while I put the hood on for instrument work.\n- The hood work seemed to go by very quickly. I climbed and turned to headings he assigned, pretty basic stuff. Then came brain disconnect number two. He had me punch in a frequency and fly directly to the VOR. The needle was centered on a 125 degree heading TO and asked if I was flying to the station. \"Yes.\" \"Uh, are you sure?\" Took me a second to take my brain out of neutral and I looked at the heading indicator and saw we were heading 280. So obviously I had to turn to track the radial to the station. Again, a random stupid mistake that he thankfully gave me a second to think about and correctly answer. Then my head went down and he had me do two unusual attitude recoveries. I was surprised at how he put us into the unusual attitudes, as it was way smoother than with Joe or Dave. Both of them really threw the plane all over the place to screw me up before handing the controls back over. The first recovery was from nose-high and the second was from a pretty steep downward spiral. I quickly recovered on both and that was it for the hood work.\n- Able to look out the window again, I climbed up to 3,000 for steep turns and stalls. The turns went great, with a 360 to the left followed immediately by a 360 to the right. He covered up the altimeter but I saw I was within about 25-50 feet of my starting point when I finished the whole maneuver. I saw a plane about 500 feet above us during the turns and I called that out as I kept moving along, probably a mark in my favor since I was obviously keeping my eyes scanning. He then asked for a power on stall in a takeoff configuration so I slowed to 60 knots, added full power, and pulled back to induce the stall and recovered. However, he said I was looking too much at the sky out the front and not enough to the sides and consequently added in a little aileron without realizing. We went thru a series of power-on stalls as he demonstrated some different things and I did a few more. Then I went into the landing configuration with 40 degrees of flaps and made a couple power-off stalls. All the stalls went relatively well but he was really harping on me to make sure I only used the rudder to avoid a spin or steep spiral.\n- Hard to believe, but he told me to fly us back to Wright Brothers and make a soft field landing. We were out over Caesar Creek Lake at this point, so in flying the 5-10 minutes back we talked about random flying stuff for a bit. I spotted some planes over Stewart as I was descending. Then I entered the pattern at MGY and made an interesting soft field landing. I did touch town softly but I was drifting (not enough crosswind correction with the aileron) and floated a bit before finally getting the thing down. I didn't like it, but he obviously was satisfied as he told me to taxi back to parking. Once I shut 60338 shut down he hopped out and told me to meet him back inside, where he printed up my temporary certificate. We only flew for 1.3 hours (including probably 0.4 in taxi time on the ground) but I did enough to earn my wings!\nHappy and excited to return to Stewart as a Private Pilot, I quickly preflighted the plane and started her up. I taxied down to Runway 20, did my runup, and announced my takeoff on the CTAF. \"Cessna departing Wright Brothers, runway is closed!\" Uhh, what? Somewhere in the couple of minutes between engine start and now a Cessna 210 landed gear-up and they closed the airport. First things first, everyone in the plane was fine unless you're counting bruised egos. I never heard them call in the traffic pattern, so I must have been looking down or checking the AWOS at just the right moment to miss them fly by. Obviously I would have yelled out \"gear up, gear up!\" on the radio if I had seen them. The runway has slight hump in it, so I couldn't even see the plane sitting down there until I taxied down the runway and back to the ramp.\nEven though I would have been long airborne before passing the plane (it was 3,500 feet down the runway) the airport was now legally closed. I didn't think it would be wise to get my certificate revoked all of 30 minutes after receiving it by knowingly departing from a closed airport. It ended up taking a couple hours to get the proper FAA/NTSB approval for a crane to lift the plane up so they could flick the switch to lower the gear and tow the plane off the runway. By the time that was complete, it was dark out. I can legally fly at night, but Stewart doesn't allow landings at night except by CFIs. So Dave ended up driving over to pick me up and they'll send someone over in the morning to fly the plane back. Not the triumphant return flight I had hoped for post-checkride but it was quite the interesting thing to witness. Plus, I was able to talk to a few other stranded pilots while we sat around for a couple hours waiting.\nI'll close with a quick thanks to all of you who have been reading this blog over the past five months and sharing in the experience with me. All your comments, thoughts, suggestions and friendship has meant a lot to me and I feel lucky to have had all your support. Now it's time for us all to hop in our planes and meet up somewhere.

Of course, it isn't much, but a little bit of anything will be a lot more than what she has had. She's doing shoulder shrugs right now. Now she's pushing her shoulders back into the pillow.

{"text": "Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt Review - An External with USB 3.0 and Thunderboltby Brian Klug on August 1, 2012 4:04 PM EST\nBack when Thunderbolt (then Intel Lightpeak) was optical, I was actively involved in covering the interface, partly out of professional curiosity due to my optical background, partly because I sincerely believe optical interfaces are an inevitable part of the future. When Lightpeak became Thunderbolt and lost the optical layer, it fell under Anand’s beat and the Mac umbrella. I acquired a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt somewhere around the same time, but never acquired any Thunderbolt peripherals or drives. Since then, Thunderbolt has slowly but surely gained traction with more and more peripherals and host devices. Initial adoption was glacial in part because most of the earliest Thunderbolt peripherals were really aimed at the very high end market with big RAID or JBOD stations, and partly due to what boiled down to Thunderbolt being Apple-only until just recently.\nThere’s an interesting story as to exactly why most of the initial Thunderbolt peripherals were aimed at such a high-end market, and some of it was purely because of both the TDP, size, and engineering constraints involved with the first generation Thunderbolt controllers. The other half of the equation is that selling external storage isn’t always the most valuable prospect, as shoppers expect commodity pricing and generally know the cost of the drive inside. Thankfully, second generation Thunderbolt controllers with smaller size, TDP, and lower cost are now the norm, and at the same time Apple has unleashed more Macs with the interface of note, meaning that there’s a bigger captive market of potentially interested shoppers.\nSo when Buffalo dropped us a line about an upcoming 2.5\" form factor portable hard drive with both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt interfaces, I couldn’t resist the temptation and jumped at the opportunity to review it. When it comes to single drive external Thunderbolt storage, the only real options at this point are either the Seagate GoFlex, or the new Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt.\nThe Buffalo MiniStation comes in two flavors, differentiated only in storage size. There’s a 1 TB version which runs $229.99 named the HD-PA1.0TU3, and a 500 GB version named the HD-PA500TU3 and priced at $199.99. The only difference is what drive you get inside; both include Thunderbolt and USB 3.0. Buffalo has also opted to include both the USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt cables with both MiniStations. Prior drives required the separate purchase of a Thunderbolt cable, which costs around $50. Since there are now multiple cable suppliers (whether this means the active controller in the cable, or companies cabling the system remains unknown to me), pricing has started creeping down and Buffalo was able to include both a 19.7 inch Thunderbolt cable and USB 3.0 cable.\n|Buffalo MiniStation Thunderbolt|\n|Storage||500 GB HDD||1 TB HDD|\n|Interface||miniUSB 3.0 (2.0 legacy), Thunderbolt (no pass through), Cables Included|\n|Size, Mass||3.17 x 5.12 x 0.91 (inches), 9.28 oz|\n|Pricing||$199.99 (newegg)||$229.99 (newegg)|\nSince Thunderbolt is still predominantly an Apple interface (7-series boards and IVB Ultrabooks notwithstanding), the industrial design of the Buffalo MiniStation is decidedly Apple inspired. The drive is made of two main parts, a single piece aluminum can in which the drive sits, and a plastic top which snaps inside this assembly.\nThere’s a series of white status LEDs which shine through a diffuse rectangular chicklet cutout on the bottom front lip, which reflects up off of a surface. The indicator light breathes like an Apple power indicator when there’s activity, and stays solid when plugged in. It’s a nice take on an external hard disk status LED that I haven’t seen done before.\nOn the underside are two small rubber feet which actually aren’t part of the aluminum base but make contact with the drive caddy inside. Regulatory markings are laser etched near the front rubber foot. At the back of course are the Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 ports, on opposite sides of the drive.\nConstruction of the MiniStation is subjectively great. There’s not much flex if you squeeze the aluminum side against the plastic lip, and it feels like a solid brick of aluminum in the hand. I’ve regularly transferred videos shot on my DSLR onto the MiniStation, then tossed the drive into the main pocket of my backpack. It isn’t a super rugged design, but definitely will get the job done.", "id": "<urn:uuid:05a10dbc-fc89-4534-8522-0a3f61f86cf8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://anandtech.com/Show/Index/6127?cPage=1&all=False&sort=0&page=1&slug=buffalo-ministation-thunderbolt-review-an-external-with-usb-30-and-thunderbolt", "date": "2013-05-18T06:44:13Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9305948615074158, "token_count": 990, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Audio length: 47:30 minutes\nTranscript published: September 22, 2010\nEnter once again into the rustic cell of Fr. Seraphim Rose with Kevin Allen as he talks with Fr. Damascene, the biographer and spiritual child of Fr. Seraphim. This is part 2 of a 3 part series and provides a unique glimpse into the life of a man who many say will someday be venerated as a Saint.\nThe interview that follows is Part 2 of a three-part series commemorating the 25th anniversary of the repose of Fr. Seraphim Rose who left this world on September 2, 1982. The interview was conducted by Illumined Heart co-host, Kevin Allen, with his biographer and spiritual child, Fr. Damascene, conducted in Fr. Seraphim’s rustic cell in the forest in Platina, California. Today’s program is titled “Fr. Seraphim Rose: The Man, the Struggler”. If you’d like information on the books published and distributed by St. Herman of Alaska Monastery, their website is www.sainthermanpress.com. Let’s return now to the rustic cell of Fr. Seraphim Rose with Kevin Allen.\nKevin: Father Damascene, thank you again for joining me on this edition of The Illumined Heart.\nFr. Damascene: Thank you, Kevin.\nKevin: It’s a blessing to be back in the monastic cell of both yourself and your mentor, Fr. Seraphim Rose, for our interview—in this edition—“The Man, the Struggler”. We’ll talk a little about Seraphim Rose as an individual. You mentioned and you’ve written in your book, Father Seraphim Rose: His Life and His Works, that a large number of figures and writers influenced Eugene Rose first and Fr. Seraphim Rose. In a brief interview, it would be impossible to go through all of the influences. But one sticks out and that one is John Maximovitch. So I thought we’d start this interview talking about St. John the Wonderworker of San Francisco, John Maximovitch, and his relationship with Fr. Seraphim Rose.\nFr. Damascene: Archbishop John was his guiding star, and he’s our guiding star. He was many things to Fr. Seraphim. He was his Hierarch when he was San Francisco’s ruling bishop. The St. Herman of Alaska brotherhood was founded with a blessing by St. John. He was the guide of the brotherhood during those early years and a personal guide and spiritual father of Fr. Seraphim. He was an example to him of what an Orthodox Christian should be. He was a living saint, as Fr. Seraphim recognized as such from the very beginning. Fr. Seraphim saw the spiritual power and grace of the Orthodox Church embodied in St. John. Fr. Alexi Young told me something that Fr. Seraphim told him back in the early days of our monastery here. He said that before Fr. Seraphim became Orthodox, he was attracted to Chinese philosophy, which he studied in depth, because it had a very noble conception of man. Later, when he became Orthodox, he found in Orthodoxy the most noble conception of man—the fulfillment of what was prefigured in Chinese philosophy. He said that he found in St. John a man more noble than any person he had met before.\nKevin: It strikes me that they were really different sorts of men in some ways. It seems to me that Fr. Seraphim was highly intellectual, almost a genius. He knew many languages and studied theology and Eastern religions. On the other hand, St. John has even been called—I hope this isn’t irreverent—a fool for Christ in some ways. They were just very different sorts of men. Do you find that ironic or striking? That a man that came from where Fr. Seraphim was coming would be so impacted by someone who had maybe a very different demeanor and orientation?\nFr. Damascene: I think that there were more similarities than differences. Obviously, they have very different backgrounds. Fr. Seraphim was raised in San Diego in an American Protestant family, and he went through this whole period of searching and struggling to find the truth. Archbishop John never went through that. He was raised in a pious, Orthodox home. So their backgrounds are very different. Where they are similar, of course, was their single-minded determination to really live out the Orthodox faith to its fullest and to really fully enter into the heart of the Church, experience the grace of the Church, and, as Fr. Seraphim said, “To find Christ in the Orthodox Church.” They were both selfless servants. Especially in Fr. Seraphim’s later life, he took on that cross of pastorship that St. John bore so nobly. In that sense they were very similar.\nIn terms of Fr. Seraphim being an intellectual and Archbishop John not being known as an intellectual, actually even in that they weren’t so different. St. John was a very intelligent person and Fr. Seraphim had this genius level IQ, but Fr. Seraphim consciously, deliberately humbled his mind. If you remember in the last talk we had, I said that Fr. Seraphim said, “I crucify my mind.” So he became like St. John. In fact, I said that St. John was a model for him. Well, he was a model for him in all ways. In presenting the theology of the Church, Fr. Seraphim was very much like St. John. Fr. Seraphim took as his example for presenting theology St. John. In fact, in an article he wrote for the 10th anniversary of St. John’s repose in 1976, he talked about the theology of St. John and began by relating a service that he had attended in San Francisco in the convent of Abbess Ariadna which was under St. John. Abbess Ariadna was a close disciple of St. John. It was the Feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God, and Fr. Seraphim, at that time Eugene Rose, was of the mindset “do we have to believe these accounts about all the Apostles being brought from the ends of the earth to attend the burial of the Mother of God? It sounds a little bit hard to believe”. Then he heard from the Abbess, during her sermon, who said, “We must believe the teaching of the Church. We must believe it simply and not doubt.” Fr. Seraphim was struck in his heart like that. He understood that we have to be simple, we have to believe simply what is handed down to us in the Church. Fr. Seraphim wrote in this article that he found that simple faith, that simple childlike faith, in St. John. That became his model for believing in the Church, believing in the theology of the Church, and presenting the theology and teaching of the Church to others.\nKevin: You wrote in your book, quoting Fr. Seraphim, where he said, “If you are an Orthodox Christian, you can do this [constantly thinking of higher things] and have people call you crazy or say that you’re a bit touched, but still you lead your own life and get to heaven.”\nFr. Damascene: Yes, I’m glad you brought that up, because that’s another aspect of St. John’s influence on Fr. Seraphim. Fr. Seraphim saw in St. John a man who lived for the other world. He was already in another world. He had his feet firmly on earth, as Fr. Seraphim said, and at the same time his mind and his heart were constantly in heaven. That’s where his heart was - as Christ said, “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” St. John’s treasure was in heaven, so he was constantly looking above. That’s one of the main things that Fr. Seraphim learned from St. John—to always be looking above. Fr. Seraphim had many struggles—after he became Orthodox and after he became a monk. There were many struggles in the monastery. Any time he would be tempted to get discouraged, and there were many times that he did, he would always be thinking of the example of St. John and how he was constantly always looking above. Fr. Seraphim would pray to St. John, “Help us out.” He knew that St. John was with him, with the brotherhood, with the monastery, as the monastery’s heavenly protector, guiding and protecting the monastery just as if he was alive and on the earth.\nKevin: So, clearly, he considered St. John Maximovitch a saint before he was officially recognized, because Fr. Seraphim reposed before that happened.\nFr. Damascene: Oh, yes. Fr. Seraphim considered him a saint while St. John was alive. At that time, in the Russian Church abroad, there were two different schools of thought on who St. John was. Some thought he was crazy—sometimes you really couldn’t depend on him; he was a little too odd, strange. And there were other people, many, many people, who regarded him as a living saint. Fr. Seraphim, from the very beginning, was in the latter group. Many of the former group repented later and acknowledged him as a saint, even at his funeral.\nKevin: St. Ignatius Brianchaninov and St. Theophan the Recluse were also important influences on Fr. Seraphim, correct?\nFr. Damascene: Yes.\nKevin: I believe somewhere he called them “the link to the Patristic Age” for those of us are in the contemporary world. How are we to understand that? Why were they considered by Fr. Seraphim to be such significant links?\nFr. Damascene: Fr. Seraphim said that if we’re going to be linked to the saints of ancient time, the Early Fathers of the Church, we have to be linked to the saints of our own time. He had that connection with St. John. And we also have to have the links to saints of recent times who transmit this Patristic wisdom from ancient times to our modern times. He said St. Ignatius (died in 1867) and St. Theophan (died in the 1890s), although they didn’t live in the 20th Century, dealt with many modern problems. Many of the issues that we face in our modern times were already known in their day. They dealt with these issues straight on and help us to know the Patristic mind as it views these various modern issues and problems.\nKevin: Moving to a different topic, from reading your book I understand that Eugene Rose prayed the panagia prayer—“Most Holy Mother of God, save us”—even before he knew the Jesus Prayer. Some might find that shocking or surprising, especially if there are any non-Orthodox out there—that he would have prayed to the Mother of God before he even prayed the Jesus Prayer formally. Can you put that in context and talk a little bit about Fr. Seraphim’s piety to the Mother of God—how it was formed in him, how he understand the place and role of the Mother of God in the life of the Orthodox Christian?\nFr. Damascene: Concerning that statement about him praying the panagia prayer before the Jesus Prayer, Fr. Seraphim prayed that prayer before he became Orthodox. He was still preparing to become an Orthodox Christian. It might have even been before he met an Orthodox priest. I don’t know, but it was definitely before he became Orthodox. He had this piety, this veneration, for the Mother of God from the very beginning. Really, this is a mystery. We just know that he was praying to the Mother of God and had this great devotion for her. Of course, he was also praying the Jesus Prayer and this was the main prayer for him, as for any Orthodox monk or Christian. But he also had this piety for the Mother of God. Every day he would say the Optina 500. That comes from the Optina Monastery. The Optina elders would have this prayer rule that they would give to people where you say 300 Jesus Prayers, then 100 prayers to the Mother of God, 50 to one’s guardian angel, and 50 to all saints.\nHe prayed much more than that and also prayed frequently akathists and canons to the Mother of God. Our former abbot, Fr. Herman, said that, especially at the end of his life, Fr. Seraphim was frequently doing these canons and akathists to the Mother of God either in the church or in his cell. And he published a book on St. John on the Orthodox veneration of the Mother of God. He understood the proper veneration. That’s really between Fr. Seraphim and the Mother of God. It’s kind of a mystery. Vladimir Lossky, in his book The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, even said that the Most Holy Mother of God is a mystery of the Church, and it’s really hard to explain to those outside the Church. We don’t believe that she is our Redemptress. Christ is our only Redeemer. But she’s a heavenly intercessor, a helper, and close to us. Fr. Seraphim had that veneration. It’s very interesting that he died in the Afterfeast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. Perhaps she took him and helped him to the other world. In our Church’s prayers, we even ask the Mother of God to help us, and, at the hour of death, to help us in the passage to heaven.\nKevin: Former Abbot Herman once called Fr. Seraphim a hesychast, and I asked this question of Abbott Gerasim when I interviewed him. For those who are listening who don’t know what that word means, it is one who prays constantly. Would you describe him as a hesychast?\nFr. Damascene: Well, Fr. Herman once told Fr. Seraphim, “Fr. Seraphim, you’re a hesychast.” Fr. Seraphim became indignant. He said, “I don’t know what that means.” He knew intellectually, but he didn’t want to pose in any way as some holy hesychast. He was not a person who stayed in his cell all the time and prayed. He prayed his cell rule at night, he said special prayers at night, and he’d be kneeling at the altar in the church in addition to attending all the daily services of the Church and serving the Divine Liturgy. He labored in the monastery. They had to labor in order to support the monastery, because they were publishing books. He was always busy and never wasted time.\nI would say that he was a hesychast in this sense: he was in a constant state of keeping his mind directed toward God and heaven, keeping his mind and his heart in the other world. He was in that constant state of watchfulness, that state of prayer. People would talk about how they would see him at the table in trapeze, saying the Jesus Prayer quietly to himself or silently. That was when people would happen to see him. What he was doing when people were not watching him, I can’t say. But from knowing him and from what other people have said, it was evident that he was in that constant state of prayer and watchfulness.\nKevin: I’d like to talk about some of the personal attributes, characteristics, and virtues of Fr. Seraphim that have been described in your book and in other places. I find it so interesting that you write that he struggled really hard to work on these. Maybe as we go through them you can highlight or give a story or give an example of each of them. I would like to quote you here for our listeners: “As Fr. Seraphim knew, transfiguration doesn’t happen of itself. He did not wait for the virtues to come naturally; but, seeing their lack in himself, he would consciously labor to acquire them, hoping on Christ to strengthen them and each day entailed constant, unseen warfare watching and fighting against the interior movements of the fallen man.” One of them, and you’ve kind of mentioned it a couple of times, is this kind of deadness to the world. Now, we tend to understand the world not as just the world we live in but the passions. Can you talk about your experience with Fr. Seraphim in that virtue?\nFr. Damascene: Definitely in terms of cutting off the passions, he was always in this watchful state. He was a dedicated, true monk. He took his monastic life seriously and the fact that he was an Orthodox Christian. He talked frequently about this struggle that the Christian life entails. He talked about how in our modern American society we don’t like struggle. He called our Modern American society “pampered”, a self-worshiping generation, the Me-Generation. He realized that we have to fight against that in ourselves—the state of always wanting to pamper ourselves, to gratify our egos and so on. So he was always in that state of putting himself to death, putting the fallen man, the old man, to death, so that Christ could live in him. He didn’t have idle moments, but was constantly laboring, praying, or somehow working for the Kingdom of God every minute of his life.\nHe talked a lot about the virtue of constancy, that we have to be constant in our daily practice of our spiritual life, constantly giving ourselves to daily spiritual injections—reading the lives of the saints, reading the spiritual literature, the Holy Scriptures, going to the services of the Church, our daily prayers, etc. He lived that life of constancy and stability, staying in one place, laboring with one’s salvation and not floating around from place to place. All these things helped him to die to the world of the passions. But in addition to that, he was dead to the world in the sense of dead to any kind of intellectual modern fashions. He saw the modern world as an anomaly. Even before he became Orthodox, he understood the modern world to be an anomaly, turned away from the wisdom that was known in ancient times and more engrossed in materialism, sensuality, and so on.\nKevin: …and the philosophies that come out of that.\nFr. Damascene: Yes, the philosophy of the 20th Century is nihilism, quoting from Nietzsche. The other side of nihilism is chiliasm which is the belief that since there is no God and no heaven, let’s make the kingdom of God on this earth. That’s where this whole pampered, self-worshiping generation comes out of. He says that we have to realize that that is in ourselves—we have this nihilism in ourselves, this unbelief in ourselves, and we have to war against and struggle against it. That’s why he was able to see through the deceptions of the modern times, whereas many contemporary Orthodox Christians kind of go along with the spirit of the times. We can kind of mix Orthodoxy with the mind of the times, with the contemporary world view and cosmology. Fr. Seraphim was able to cut through that deception. Where the teachings of the Holy Fathers, for example, were at variance with the modern world view and cosmology, modern scientific theoretical models, Fr. Seraphim openly taught that these were incompatible, and this is the teaching of the Fathers. He did not try to make some artificial combination and force the teachings of the Fathers into the modern cosmology. He didn’t want to view Orthodoxy and the teachings of the Fathers from the point of view of a modern mind looking at them. He wanted to look at the modern world from the point of view of the Holy Fathers. In order to do that, he had to acquire the mind of the Fathers. In order to acquire the mind of the Fathers, he had to put to death his own mind. That’s why he said, “I crucify my mind.” That’s what makes him so special. He was this great intellect, but he crucified that mind, humbled it. He had that simple faith of St. John and all saints.\nKevin: You’ve written that he was a discerner of the times. I think we’ve kind of covered that one. He saw the times for what they were. He didn’t buy into the nonsense that most of us buy into. He was able to separate the wheat from the proverbial chaff and know what the Patristic mindset was. Is that correct?\nFr. Damascene: Yes. Even before he became Orthodox, he was involved with that whole nihilistic mentality. He kind of lived through that and emerged out of it, so it gave him kind of an edge to understand the nature of the times. He was also on the vanguard of that whole movement toward Eastern religions that occurred in the West, beginning in the late 50s and early 60s. He was able to show the way out of that as well.\nKevin: You’ve spoken about this but maybe you can just highlight on his humility and the fact that there is “no spiritual pretense or affectation on him” (your words).\nFr. Damascene: He didn’t think much of himself really. He knew what he was about, and he knew what Orthodoxy was about. In that sense, he was very firm in his conviction and belief. But personally he didn’t think much of himself. He didn’t want to exalt himself in any way or think of himself highly. That’s why, as I said earlier, when Fr. Herman called him a hesychast, he didn’t like it at all. I remember that I was at a lecture at St. Herman pilgrimage in 1981, and I was sitting in the audience. Fr. Seraphim was giving a talk and asking for questions and answers. Some person stood up in the back and said, “Fr. Seraphim, I perceive you are a holy man.” Fr. Seraphim did not like that and said, “Get to the question. What’s the question?” That’s just one example. In knowing him and with people telling me about him, I know that he really cultivated that virtue of humility. And certainly whatever intellectual power he had, he had no pride in that. It meant nothing in the scheme of things in the Christian life.\nKevin: You write that love was something that was important and you experienced that. Tell us about that. That’s a virtue that, with someone like him, maybe you wouldn’t expect with his intellect and ascetism. Can you talk about how that manifested itself?\nFr. Damascene: I mentioned before that he went through this spirit of intellectual elitism before he became Orthodox. I don’t think he was very loving there. I think deep down he had a loving heart, but it wasn’t opened up. Through the grace of the Church, when he was received into the Church and received the sacraments of the Church and living the Orthodox life and had such examples before him, like St. John, that love blossomed out in him. It just grew as time went on, especially as he grew as a pastor. His faith matured right up to the time of his death. His love was manifested in his concern and care for people and his suffering for and over them, praying for them. We had these young men sing in the monastery and some of them came from troubled backgrounds. Fr. Seraphim would be praying in the altar at night, weeping over these people. Many people would talk about how he would sacrifice for them. It would be snowing outside, and he would have to walk several times up and down the hill to get people’s cars stuck out of the road. So there were many ways that he sacrificed himself, and that’s where we see most of all that love. He talked about that a lot.\nHe saw that one of the main dangers of Orthodoxy in our times is this “head knowledge”—we become Orthodox in order to be better than the Protestants or Catholics, or we know more than them, or we have the right teaching, etc. It’s a temptation because Orthodoxy means “right glorification”. So people have this temptation to be correct, to be intellectually superior to others.\nKevin: Hyper Orthodox.\nFr. Damascene: Yes. It’s all in the head, and he would say that’s not going to save you. You have to develop your heart. You have to have a Christian heart. He would say that you can be Orthodox without being Christian, in the sense that you can intellectually have these right beliefs but you’re not really living a Christian life. We have to develop, make the heart more supple and warm, and we have to pray for that.\nKevin: Speaking of heart, that’s a great lead in on this aspect of his personality—pain of heart and suffering. I know that his monastic partner and former Abbot Herman wrote, “Above all, Fr. Seraphim knew how to suffer.” You also refer to the pain of heart. Can you talk a bit about how Fr. Seraphim understood the pain of heart and suffering in the life of an Orthodox Christian?\nFr. Damascene: He said that the main key to enter into the mind of the Holy Fathers was precisely that pain of heart. I think he meant different things by that. It’s the suffering that all Christians must endure in this world, because we’re not of this world. We’re living for another world, so we’re not going to fit in totally with the world. We’re going to have to suffer in some way in the world, if we’re really living an Orthodox life. If we feel totally comfortable in the world, then something’s wrong. That kind of suffering is one aspect.\nSecondly, pain of heart is repenting over one’s sins. There is pain of heart in praying for others and caring for other people. Elder Paisios of Mt. Athos talks a lot about feeling pain in one’s heart when praying for others. He said, in order for one’s prayers to really be effectual, you really have to feel that pain. Another aspect of pain of heart is a literal pain of heart. The Holy Fathers, including Elder Paisios, talk about the literal pain of heart where the mind descends into the heart—the heart is the center and pious part of the soul, the nous—and a person can literally feel pain in the physical organ of the heart. Fr. Seraphim said that the heart is not just a pump—it’s an organ that knows God. The Holy Fathers, including St. Silhouan the Athonite, talk about how we have the physical heart in addition to the metaphysical heart, which is the center of our being and the place where we feel that repentance and pain of suffering over others and our praying for them.\nKevin: For those of us who are not in a vocational place where we can really approach that level of understanding (I’m tempted to go there, but I know it’s above my head), would pain of heart be just caring deeply for others, putting others above self and sharing in the suffering of others and the world and over one’s sins?\nFr. Damascene: Yes, absolutely. We pray with all our heart, and that’s a kind of pain of heart. Nobody is without suffering. Suffering is the reality of the human condition since the fall. God has allowed that in order to remind us that we’re not God, and we have to return to God. This fallen world is not our final home, but the Kingdom of heaven is our final home. So we’re going to suffer. The question is what are we going to do in that suffering? Are we going to seek distraction…\nFr. Damascene: Drugs, Valium, or some technological device where we can entertain ourselves and tune everything out…\nKevin: Entertain ourselves to death…\nFr. Damascene: Yes, exactly. What are we going to do in that suffering? Are we going to try and escape from it? There are so many ways. The world is perfecting the art of escaping from suffering. Each year new things come out to escape from suffering. But instead of escaping from it we have to face that suffering and endure it. As St. Mark the Ascetic said, “Endure it in the spirit of devotion to Christ.” That’s what pain of heart is. Are we going to lay that suffering before God in prayer, in the spirit of devotion? Are we going turn away from God, tune him out, and seek distraction? Each person, whether or not he can enter these deep levels of prayer of the heart, can enter into that experience of pain of heart.\nKevin: Thank you for clarifying that. I appreciate that and I know our listeners will too. I think I read in one of your interviews that said you always felt deep stillness in his presence.\nFr. Damascene: Yes. First of all, literally. When I would sit and talk with him—I remember sitting on a little log outside the church, and I would be talking about things going on at the campus, and he would just listen. Then I would say something, and he would just say a few words. He wouldn’t say much and then he would become silent. He would be waiting for me to say something. Then I would say something and he would say something. If he had something to say, he’d say it. There would be these moments of silence. Fr. Seraphim didn’t want to say an unnecessary word. You can read the writings of the Holy Fathers, like St. Joseph of Optina. People said he really didn’t say too much. It’s because he didn’t want to speak an unnecessary word. He didn’t want to offer his own ideas. He wanted it to come from the Holy Spirit. If he was asked a question, then it meant that he was called upon to answer. So oftentimes, Fr. Seraphim would just be silent.\nI have a friend who is an Orthodox Christian who became Orthodox just about the same time that I did, in fact she was at Fr. Seraphim’s first lecture at UC Santa Cruz. She remembers talking with Fr. Seraphim. She would be talking away, and Fr. Seraphim kind of had his hand near his mouth, and then she noticed that she was crossing his mouth. Her understanding of that was that Fr. Seraphim didn’t want to offer any words from his own wisdom, his own opinion. He wanted to offer something that came from God. In that sense, he had that silence. That was a literal sense of silence.\nAlso, there is that spiritual sense. Many people have talked about this, and I myself have experienced it. Fr. Vladimir Anderson is a close, spiritual godson of Fr. Seraphim, as was Fr. Alexi Young who is now Hiermonk Ambrose. They both talk about when they were in Fr. Seraphim’s presence, there was a stillness that kind of radiated from him. They would come with these problems, and they were kind of agitated, coming from the world, and they were in the presence of Fr. Seraphim. Even though he didn’t have to say many words, that stillness was contagious. They caught that stillness and walked away feeling it. Another spiritual daughter of Fr. Seraphim, Barbara Murray, says that she would come to Fr. Seraphim with all kinds of perplexities, and she would wonder, “How am I going to deal with all these problems that I am facing in my life?” She would leave Fr. Seraphim and go to church and suddenly all the problems didn’t seem important at all. He had that stillness. Also, Fr. Alexi said that at the end of Fr. Seraphim’s life, right before he died (it was the last time he saw Fr. Seraphim before he got sick), he sat outdoors with Fr. Seraphim talking and he felt that very profoundly, that stillness that came from his being totally at peace. Right before he died, he had really entered into that deep stillness, that peace.\nFr. Damascene: Palpable stillness, yes…\nKevin: …that could be communicated to others almost.\nFr. Damascene: It’s like what Christ said, “My peace I give you, not as the world gives, give I unto you.” It’s Christ’s peace. It’s not the peace of the world. This is what Fr. Seraphim had.\nKevin: Again, I’m quoting a lot of former Abbot Herman from your book, but he said that he learned patience from Fr. Seraphim.\nFr. Damascene: Yes, that was a virtue that he had and cultivated. I mentioned earlier that he talked about these virtues of constancy and stability. Even before he became a monk, there was another friend of the brotherhood from the very early days, when Fr. Seraphim was still a layman and working in the Orthodox bookstore—a friend named Anthony. He was a layman, and Fr. Seraphim (at that time, Eugene Rose) would talk to him about stability. He would say that if you go to a parish and you find that there is better chanting in another parish, or perhaps the spiritual father spends more time with people in confessions or maybe the spiritual level seems higher in another parish, whatever it is that seems more spiritual, don’t go, don’t leave your parish. Stay in one place. If you jump around from place to place, you’re not really putting down roots, and you can’t really grow spiritually. In order to grow spiritually, you have to put down those roots. Fr. Seraphim did that very much in his own life. When he came to the monastery, he just wanted to stay here. He didn’t even want to travel. Fr. Herman would say to him, “Don’t you want to go to Mt. Athos?” Fr. Seraphim would say, “No, we have to find Mt. Athos in our own hearts.”\nKevin: Father, you wrote in the eighth chapter of your book, Father Seraphim Rose: His Life and His Works, entitled “The Taste of Hell”, the “forbidden deeds” that, at that time Eugene Rose, had “disgusted him even at the time he was committing them”. You don’t go into details and I’m not asking for the details. But I’m assuming that they were of a sexual or fleshly nature. I’m wondering how and what did Fr. Seraphim counsel on these sorts of struggles.\nFr. Damascene: Well, he gave the teachings of the Fathers on dealing with sexual temptations and passions. Of course, he recognized that this was a very prevalent problem in our times. I think it’s more prevalent today since his repose, with Internet pornography. It’s a new thing the devil has invented to tempt people. In one letter that he wrote to a spiritual son he said, “Flee quickly to the prayer of Jesus,” quoting from Abbot Barsanuphius of Gaza which he translated. He says, “Flee quickly to the prayer of Jesus and you will find repose. Pray ceaselessly, saying ‘Lord Jesus Christ, deliver me from shameful passions.’” So he would counsel to turn to God in prayer. If we turn to God in prayer, first of all, we can’t be indulging in these sexual passions in our mind or physically if we’re in the presence of God and conscious of God’s presence. Fr. Seraphim constantly had God in his mind. His mind and heart were directed toward heaven and God. If we have our mind in heaven like that, then we won’t be going down to the earth to these sinful passions. So, first of all, raising the mind to God in that way is a major help. Secondly, God does help. We pray to God, and it’s not just the fact that we’re turning our mind to him. It’s not just psychologically, but we are receiving God’s grace and help. There were other counsels he gave concerning avoiding over familiarity with people with whom you might be tempted to have a sinful relationship with. Just being constantly on guard in the spiritual life.\nKevin: Father, you commented to me in your book. You mentioned that Eugene Rose had written in a letter some suicidal thoughts. Former Abbot Herman mentioned that he definitely had a death wish. What would you say to those who might comment that, because of his psychology, Fr. Seraphim represents a Christianity which somewhat overplays morbidity.\nFr. Damascene: We have to distinguish between the “old” Eugene Rose and the “reborn” Eugene Rose and Fr. Seraphim. Fr. Seraphim was literally reborn when he entered the Orthodox Church. He wrote about this. He said that he had been reborn in the Lord and he had felt such joy that he had never known. All the goodness that was already in his nature just blossomed out and was multiplied by the grace of God which united with his soul. He became a new being. It was that old Eugene Rose that had those suicidal thoughts. As you mentioned, in one of Fr. Seraphim’s letter, during a very dark period of his life before his conversion, he does mention having suicidal thoughts. He was in despair of not finding the truth. They said that he experienced the torments of hell even while he was alive. He had consciously turned away from God, because he had not found him in the religion in which he was raised. He was looking for something more, looking for that truth. He encountered that truth in Orthodoxy. When he became Orthodox, he became a new person. Of course he had no suicidal thoughts after he became Orthodox. There’s no record of that, and I certainly would doubt it, knowing of his true rebirth in Christ and the Orthodox Church.\nBut he had a healthy remembrance of death, as the Fathers talk about, and wanted to continue working. He felt that we had a limited time in order to do the work of God. He said, “It’s later than you think; therefore, hasten to do the work of God.” He had that awareness. He had a limited number of years, and he wanted those years in order to come closer to God, to find God. He told Fr. Alexi young that if you don’t find God in this life, you will not find him in the life to come. He wanted to draw closer to Christ and have that closer experience of Christ in the Church—the deeper experience of the Church. And an important part of his life was to bring that Orthodox faith and grace of the Church to others, to the non-Orthodox, to be a disseminator of grace. He wanted to bring the truth that he had discovered in the Orthodox Church and over which he had suffered so long to find. He wanted to give that truth to others, and that truth was Jesus Christ. He said that, when he became Orthodox, he understood that truth was a person. So he had that desire to live and bring forth fruit in the time God gave him. Therefore, I don’t think he was morbid. He definitely had a healthy understanding of Christian struggle and the place of suffering in life. Maybe that’s what some people might consider morbid. He was a monk and just lived the life of a true monk. I don’t think he was extreme.\nKevin: Which raises a question, as we’re leaning toward the wrap up of this interview, and that is this: Since his work is so missionizing and evangelical in orientation, and since he was a discerner of the times and talked about topics which are so important in the modern world we live in (therefore, a lot of people will read them), do you think that there is a temptation perhaps, for those of us who are not monastics and who read the work of one whom you’ve just described as being a maximalist, to perhaps confuse his vocation and calling as a monk with the normal or appropriate non-monastic life for those who are reading his work? Is there some way you can respond to that?\nFr. Damascene: Well, he did write his works for the non-monastics as well as the monastics. He wrote for the general readership and trying to reach out to everyone. He wrote a lot about putting the monastic texts of the Orthodox Church in their proper context, according to one’s own spiritual state. He said that we should not, either as monks or lay people, be proud and think that we can apply some very lofty teachings in the line of Divine Ascent or the Philokalia to our own spiritual state as if we are on the level of a saint. We have to realize that we’re starting our spiritual life at the lowest step, whether we’re monks or lay people. We have to have a down-to-earth, realistic understanding of our own low spiritual state, and the low spiritual state of our times. As I mentioned before, he said we have to understand that we come out of the self-worshiping, pampered generation. So, I think his writings are applicable to everyone, because he meant them to be that way, and he has many warnings in his writings against misapplying spiritual texts to one’s spiritual condition.\nKevin: So he didn’t expect obviously everybody who would read his works to come to the wilderness and live in a ten by fifteen foot, rustic cell.\nFr. Damascene: Absolutely not. He would not expect that. His constant teaching was that we are to apply the teachings of the Church, the writings of the Fathers and the monastic saints, etc. to our own condition.\nKevin: Father, as we wrap up, I have one final question, and it’s a tough one because it’s so broad. What in your opinion about Fr. Seraphim’s life and writing has inspired and fascinated so many people all over the world. You mentioned Russia. They may have read more about him than people in the States. What is it about his life and his work?\nFr. Damascene: There are many aspects and many things that can be said about that. First of all, he was a discerner of the times. He understood the modern times very deeply, and he also understood the Orthodox faith very deeply. So he was able to cut through the deceptions of the times and give the Orthodox teaching, the teaching of the Fathers, straight. When you go to Fr. Seraphim, you find the pure teaching of the Fathers, the pure water of grace that come from those writings. It’s not distorted or twisted or artificially molded to conform to the modern mentality. You find a basic honesty in his writings, which I think is very refreshing for many people. Some people can kind of fudge a little bit. If there’s a teaching of the Church that’s a little bit too hard for our self-worshiping, pampered generation to take, they can kind of fudge a little bit, kind of soften it around the edges. Fr. Seraphim didn’t do that. I think some people get turned off by that and have a hard time with it. But there are many people who want that. I really appreciate that.\nI should say, also, Fr. Seraphim can be very hard-hitting in his writings, because he was writing for everybody and this was going out to the world. He didn’t want to compromise or sugarcoat anything. But pastorally, when he was dealing with people on a one-to-one basis, he was different. You see that in his letters. Therefore, you’re dealing with a soul, and the soul has these various burdens and obstacles. He understood as a pastor that you have to reach out to a person where there are and not expect too much. As Christ said you don’t want to put new wine into old bottles. So he was very careful with that. For example, when he talked with people who were involved in Eastern religions, he would take a different tone than when he was writing about Orthodoxy and the religion of the future. When he was writing to people coming out of a Charismatic background, he would be different.\nKevin: That’s an important nuance of reading him, that as a pastor he was applying that warm-heartedness and love, whereas here had to deal with a movement or large issue of the times. It might come across a little on the strong side or the hard-hitting side. Father Damascene, again, thank you very much for this wonderful interview. It’s very much appreciated.", "id": "<urn:uuid:30e5f942-2f29-4ba9-8952-d80600febe50>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ancientfaith.com/podcasts/illuminedheart/fr_seraphim_rose_the_man_the_struggler/print", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9877641797065735, "token_count": 9709, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Below, I essentially replicate his results with the purpose of trying to reproduce them in a way that is a little easier for mere mortals like myself to digest. Instead of showing the entire distribution, I use mean values for each group. Razib concludes:\nThe general qualitative result: American conservative Protestants are in the main to the center or social liberal end of Muslim public opinion. They are not comparable at all to Muslim reactionaries.As the averages make clearer, conservative Protestants (defined here as those who expressed a preference for the Republican party) are in fact more liberal on each of these issues than Muslims in any of the countries included are. Keep in mind, the comparison here is between conservative Protestants and all Muslims, not just between evangelicals and reactionary Islamists. The latter comparison would show conservative Protestants to be even more liberal relative to Muslims than this comparison does.\nFinally, using standard deviation values reported in the WVS, each of the tables also shows where the average conservative Protestant fits into the Muslim distribution*. So, on the question of the justifiability of homosexuality, the average conservative American Protestant is at 71st percentile of the Muslim population. Because the wife-beating question is inverted, the figure shows where the average conservative Protestant falls on the another-black-eye-to-explain-to-the-neighbors-is-unjustifiable distribution. The higher the value (on a 1-10 scale), the more justifiable the act or behavior in question is viewed as being:\n|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.2|\n|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||71st percentile|\n|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.5|\n|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||73rd percentile|\n|Man to beat his wife||Score|\n|Conservative Protestants (US)||1.3|\n|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||63rd percentile|\nWVS variables used: V185, V231(Republican), V202, V204, V208\n* Arrived at by simply averaging the averages of each of the Muslim groups on each question. This skews Muslim opinion towards that of the Middle East and North Africa and away from South Asia, which, in terms of sheer numbers, is unrepresentative of the world's roughly 1.6 billion Muslims. Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh all have far more Muslims than any of the MENA countries do, but with the exception of Pakistan, when Americans think of Muslims, they primarily have Arabs and Persians in mind.", "id": "<urn:uuid:72d93b86-e729-4691-baf5-73415c854495>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2012/05/religious-conservatives-in-us-more.html?showComment=1336500736575", "date": "2013-05-18T07:19:36Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.893719494342804, "token_count": 515, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Octodon degus is generally considered endemic to west central Chile, where it inhabits the lower slopes of the Andes. Although some have argued that its range may extend north into Peru, this is not well supported. It is common in the international pet trade, however, and is often used in laboratory studies outside of its native range. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus inhabits a mediterranean-type semi-arid shrubland ecosystem called \"matorral\", which is found on the western slopes of the Andes between 28 and 35 degrees south latitude. Further north the climate becomes too arid to support this plant community, and further south it is too wet. Degus appear to be limited to elevations below 1200 meters, both by the distribution of their habitat and by their intolerance of low oxygen partial pressure. Degus are well able to inhabit lands influenced by cattle grazing, and are agricultural pests in some areas. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Fulk, 1976)\nOctodon degus superficially resembles a gerbil, but is much larger. Degus typically weigh between 170 and 300 g, and measure between 325 and 440 mm in length, including the tail. The fur is yellow-brown on the back and head, and the underparts and feet are cream colored. There is a pale band around the eye and, in some individuals, the neck. The tail is moderately long and conspicuously tufted. The ears are large and darkly pigmented. The fifth digit is reduced, and on the forefeet it has a nail instead of a claw. The cheekteeth are hypsodont and their biting surfaces resemble a figure of eight. Sexes are difficult to distinguish, but males tend to be about 10% larger than females. Pups are born furred and able to see, and begin exploring within hours of birth. Octodon degus can be distinguished from the two other members of the genus Octodon by slight differences in dental morphology. It is also smaller than its relatives and its tail is said to be more noticeably tufted. (Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004)\nDuring the annual breeding season, male-male aggression temporarily increases. Males exclude other males from their burrow and monopolize the females (usually 2 to 4) who live there. Dustbathing and urine marking may be used in the defense of territory by both sexes, but these behaviors particularly increase in the male during the breeding season. Courting males often engage in mutual grooming with females, and frequently perform a courtship ritual which involves wagging of the tail and trembling of the body. The male then raises a hind leg and sprays urine onto the female. This may serve to familiarize her with his scent and perhaps make her more receptive to his advances in the future. Receptive females may sometimes enurinate males in a similar fashion. Related female degus may nurse each other's young. (Ebensperger and Caiozzi, 2002; Fulk, 1976; Kleiman, 1974; Soto-Gamboa, 2005)\nIn the wild degus tend to breed once per year. The breeding season usually begins in late May (autumn in Chile), and the young are conceived in late winter to early spring (September to October). In wet years, degus may produce second litters. It has been suggested that degus may be induced ovulators, but this has not been established for certain. There is also some evidence that male reproductive organs may be sensitive to changes in photoperiod. The gestation period is 90 days, and litter size is typically 4-6 pups. The young are precocial. They are born with fur and teeth; their eyes are open and they are able to move about the nest on their own. Pups are weaned at 4 to 5 weeks, and become sexually mature between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Degus do not reach adult size until about 6 months of age, however, and they generally live in same-sex social groups until they are about 9 months old and their first breeding season occurs. It has been reported that pups raised in isolation in the laboratory experience severe neural and behavioral abnormalities. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nBefore conception can occur, the male degu must invest considerable energy in the defense of his territory and harem from other males. The female subsequently expends considerable energy in gestation and lactation. The pregnancy is relatively long for a rodent, and the young are born well developed. After birth, both parents protect and provision the pups. Degus nest communally, and groups of related females nurse one another's young. In the laboratory, the female remains close to the pups until two weeks after birth, and males have been observed to huddle with the young during this period without instances of infanticide. In the wild, male degus may spend as much time feeding and huddling with the young as females do. Pups begin to eat solid food at about two weeks of age, and venture out of the burrow at three weeks. Upon weaning at four to six weeks, the pups are able to live independently of the parents and form same-sex social groups until their first breeding season. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nIn laboratory conditions, degus typically live five to eight years.\nDegus are social and tend to live in groups of one to two males and two to five related females. Females participate in rearing on another's young. Groups maintain territories throughout much of the year. Degus are semi-fossorial, digging extensive communal burrow systems. These burrows are often shared by Bennett's chinchilla rat (Abrocoma bennettii). Degus feed exclusively above ground, however, and have been observed climbing into the low branches of shrubs while foraging. Dustbathing is an important social behavior among degus. Groups repeatedly mark favorite wallows with urine and anal gland secretions. This may help the group identify each other by scent as well as delineating territorial boundaries. Degus are mainly diurnal, and are most active during the morning and evening. (Ebensperger, et al., 2004; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nFulk (1976) estimated that social groups of degus occupy home areas of roughly 200 square meters, and that their density is about 75 degus per hectare. This may be an underestimate, however, due to the trapping methods used. (Fulk, 1976)\nDegus have well-developed sight, smell, and hearing. They are highly vocal and use various calls to communicate with one another, including alarm calls, mating calls, and communication between parents and young. Vision is very important in avoidance of predators and in foraging. It has been shown that degus are able to see ultraviolet wavelengths, and that their urine reflects in the UV range when fresh. It has therefore been suggested that degus' urine scent marks are also visual cues. These scent marks are also used as dust wallows, allowing members of a social group to identify each other by scent. (Chavez, et al., 2003; Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nDegus are generalist herbivores. They feed on the leaves, bark, and seeds of shrubs and forbs. Among their favorite foods are the bark of Cestrum palqui and Mimosa cavenia, leaves and bark of Proustia cuneifolia, Atriplex repunda, and Acacia caven, annuals such as Erodium cicutarum when in season, green grasses, and thistle seeds. Degus choose food items that reduce fiber and increase nitrogen and moisture in the diet, and thus prefer young leaves and avoid woodier shrubs. Degus rely on microbial fermentation in their enlarged cecum (they are \"hindgut fermenters\") to digest their food. They reingest a large percentage of their feces, usually during the night. This allows them to maximize their digestion. Degus store food in the winter, and it has been reported that they occasionally eat meat in old age. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998; Kenagy, et al., 1999; Veloso and Kenagy, 2005; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus is subject to predation by larger mammals such as culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus), and from the air by raptors such as barn owls (Tyto alba), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), and black-chested buzzard eagles (Geranoaetus melanoleucus). Degus use vigilance and cover to avoid predators. Their pelage is also counter-shaded and matches the soil color, which reduces visibility to predators. Degus live socially and use alarm calls to warn others of danger. When a predator is spotted, they take cover in shrubby areas and may retreat to the communal burrow. (Ebensperger and Wallem, 2002; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus affects the plant community in its habitat by selective browsing. Degus behaviorally reduce the fiber content of their diet, preferrentially eating shrubs such as Adesmia bedwellii, Baccharis paniculata, and Chenopodium petioare, which are less fibrous and less thorny than others. These species have been shown to increase their foliage area upon exclusion of degus. As degus are very common, they are themselves an important food source for their predators. (Gutierrez and Bozinovic, 1998)\nDegus often live in association with Bennett's chinchilla rats (Abrocoma bennettii). The two species are known to share burrow systems and have even been observed in the same chamber within a burrow. This is believed to be a mutualistic relationship, but it is not well understood. (Fulk, 1976; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nDegus are frequently kept as pets, and are used extensively in laboratory research. Because they are largely diurnal, they are useful in research on circadian rhythms, and their intolerance of sugars makes them ideal models for diabetes research. (Lee, 2004)\nDegus are significant agricultural pests in some areas. They take advantage of cultivated prickly pear cactus, wheat, vineyards, and orchards as abundant food sources, and can do considerable damage. They are also known to host three species of parasites that can infect humans.

{"text": "The first day of spring was a couple of days ago, and I for one am glad to see it - except that I can already tell the pollen is starting to come out. I'm like a human barometer for that every year. :-)\nI'm sorry I have not posted much here over the last few weeks. I've been incredibly busy with regular store business. For folks that blog several times a week, or even several times a day, my question is - how the heck do you guys have the time? I always think of Glen Reynolds over at Instapundit. He posts maybe 10-20 times a day all day long, and I figure whatever else he does, his entire life must revolve around his blog. When he's not blogging, he's thinking about blogging, or looking for things to blog about, or conversing with people that write in about the blog. I seem to always have something else to do that needs to be done NOW. Anyway, my goal here is going to be to post at least once a week, so we'll see how that turns out.\nIt has been another exciting week here at Anime Corner world headquarters, and I have several items to share with you:\nErgo Proxy 3 arrived on Friday - we had it air freighted in from Geneon so we could start shipping orders as early as possible. We're shipping it now and all of your pre-orders were filled by close of business on Friday March 23rd. Oh yeah, all of our copies of Ergo 3 in this shipment have the limited pencil board - we'll be shipping those first until they run out.\nI spend a lot of my time here on 'logistics' - you know, figuring out where and when and how stuffis coming, and there certainly has been a lot of activity in that dept this week. We got a slew of new solicitations over that last couple of weeks for June and July titles and we'll have them all up on the site shortly. A couple of the new titles include Galaxy Angel AA and MAR which are already posted. Also, Geneon will be re-releasing Ikki Tousen in a Thin-Pak (same price, same bat channel) in June and won't be repressing the old box, so it will probably be unavailable for a short time until the new boxes come out. Finally, we now have the last volume of Inu Yasha up for pre-order - volume #55! Wow - 4 years to get a series released, it reminds me if Urusei Yatsura or DBZ. Now when are the rest of those IY boxed sets coming??.... -_^\nWe have a couple more date changes this week - in fact there have been so many lately they are getting hard to keep up with. Tactics 4 was pushed from 3-20 to 3-27, but became moot as it has already arrived. The new company Illumitoon pushed the BoBoBoBo 2 DVD from 4-6 to 5-1. They also announced that the Beet 2 DVD and the BT'X 2 DVD have been pulled entirely from the release schedule and will be re-announced at a later date. Since these titles have sold moderately well, one can only speculate at this point as to what their plans are, but we'll keep on top of things and let you know. Geneon cancelled the Paradise Kiss 3 Special Edition DVD, but the regular edition is still set to street on April 17th.\nI know I've done a lot of talking about the upcoming Melancholy limited edition boxes. Sam, the product manager at Bandai, told me this week that they are producing exactly 20,000 boxed sets for the North American release, and they were surprised by the massive amount of retailer pre-orders for them that have already been placed. The boxes are made overseas and the order has been placed by Bandai, so Sam says quote \"once they are gone there is no more - period\". I can almost guarantee you that this box is now, or almost is, sold out in pre-release and will be allocated to retailers by Bandai. Sam said that retailers who order early will be more likely to get the product that they ordered. That's good news as we got our order in on the first day, so our units are right at the front of the line and we will be able to guarantee delivery of boxes up to about the first 500 pre-ordered (we're 82% of the way there now as of 3/23), and I will probably close the pre-order window once we hit the 500 mark.\nWe have posted quite a few new announcements for pre-order, some of the more notable include Wings of Rean, the 4th Naruto Uncut Box, the 2nd Prince of Tennis Box, the 2nd Ranma 1/2 Thin-Pak, and the first Freedom DVD (HDDVD/DVD) which will be the very first HD-DVD Anime release here in North America. I was wondering when that was going to happen. :-)\nA lot of people have been asking us recently what we plan to do about the postal rate increase coming next month. Admittedly shipping charges have been a point of consternation for us as we try to offer you a great deal of choices, excellent delivery time and quality, and still offer shipping at a reasonable price. We have not increased our shipping prices in 3 years even though all of the carriers have increased their rates to us several times during this period. As shipping has become the 'condiment' of the internet shopping world (you know, serve a lower quality hot-dog but give the mustard away for free), it's become very challenging for us to try to put together a new shipping program that covers our actual freight costs but that fits the requirements of all of your diverse needs. We are currently working on a new shipping program that is similar to what we offer now, with our usual diverse selection or types, carriers, and quality of delivery, but that will also offer more choices for budget minded customers. We'll be integrating the new program into the new order checkout manager, and we would greatly appreciate any input on this subject that you guys have for us. Your comments help us better tailor our program to fit your specific needs, and that's what it's all about.\nAfter many requests, we've expanded our trade in program to include video games, even really old ones. Check our trade in FAQ for details.\nI have two great sales for you this week, one is a newsletter exclusive set of coupons that you canuse across the store, and the other is a nice set of overstocked figure discounts (up to 35% off) that we need to move out to make room for new arrivals. Newsletter subscribers can combine the two offers to save even more! See below for all the info.\nTo save 3% off any order over $75, use the following coupon code during checkout:\nOr to save 5% off any order over $150, use the following coupon code during checkout:\nCoupons are valid ONLY for NEW orders, and are good through Thursday, March 29th only.\nYou can combine the two offers to save even more!\nWe have some great new stuff for this week in just about every category from DVD's to Manga to Figures to Statues, and even some cool new character merchandise including new scrolls and a couple of rare Anime themed bath towels that arrived from Japan. Be sure to take a look at the excellent new Sana Horiuchi figure from Pia Carrot and the very large Tamaki Kousaka from To Heart as they are two of my favorites. Also, we have a few of both of the new Tandem Twins girls left over after filling your pre-orders - including the much sought after 'option' parts that bring the figures, well, to their full potential. :-)\nFinally, we received a special shipment of art books that I was able to coax away from one of our vendors in Tokyo. Many of these gorgeous art books have been out of print for more than 5 years and since they are extremely rare we might only have as little as 2 or 3 copies of each.\nThis little shipment was a long time in the making, and I hope we are able to help you fill some of the holes in your collection. I know it certainly helped mine. :-)", "id": "<urn:uuid:ba7abe35-1add-44d8-89d4-dc880bf01545>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://animecornerstore.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:13:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9792786240577698, "token_count": 1712, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Monday, April 27, 2009\n***Photo by Elliot Cowan. Left to right: me, Linda Beck, and Tim Rauch. Deeper in the background are Willy Hartland and Ray Kosarin. From drinks after the ASIFA event.\nASIFA-East's Linda Beck just put together a panel on the State of NY Animation, and you can read Katie Cropper's tidy summary of it at the ASIFA-East exposure sheet blog at www.asifaeast.com. The panel discussion was moderated by Linda Beck and featured Howard Beckerman, David Wachtenheim, Steve Connor, and myself.\nHoward Beckerman was his usual charming self and to record all his wisdom here would be impossible. I will say that he was a calming voice of reason, giving us example after example of how this has all happened before. He also shared some of his strategies for surviving in this fickle industry, reminding that when one door closed another always opened. In other words, when theatrical cartoons dwindled TV commercials appeared to pick up the slack.\nSteve Connor pragmatically suggested that everyone devote their efforts to making solid work on schedule and on budget and how that alone can help keep projects flowing in the Big Apple. He also suggested that even independent projects could be planned out with a better process that could be applied to making the same project with a larger crew should the project grow to a series.\nDavid Wachtenheim (of Wachtenheim/Marianetti) eloquently spoke of shrinking budgets and less commercial work floating around these days. He worried about the perception of clients, that there's a kid in his living room somewhere that can do the work cheaper and at a \"good enough\" quality.\nAfter the panel, fifty of us headed over to grab drinks at a nearby bar. While I was munching on a burger, Katie Cropper and I were discussing the evening. She told me that my message of \"make things happen, make your own luck, and work on your own projects,\" suited my personality. \"It's natural for you to do that,\" she said. And, this made me wonder just how much personality weighs in to a career. Although I would caution that what one does well often appears to others as if its effortless or simply natural.\nNo two of us are hard wired the same way. And, I think too many of us are at the mercy of our own harmful thinking. At the panel, I explained that I don't give much thought to what is going on in the economy and how it might effect NY animation. Instead, I am aware (as Howard Beckerman kept pointing out) that NY animation has always had its ups and downs. My focus is to only worry about what I can control. Therefore, I make films, I pitch shows and children's books. I look out for interesting work opportunities and am careful to nurture relationships that often lead to more work.\nDuring the panel, I told the audience that I tried to follow a smart plan as an at-home freelancer. In my current pair of freelance gigs for Sesame Workshop, I am sure to check in with the client on a regular basis to give them updates on the status of the work. Recently, they had an internal meeting to change the creative direction on one of the jobs. The producer gave me the choice of coming in for the meeting or just getting an update afterwards. For me, there was no choice. Of course I wanted to be at the meeting! Not only would attending the meeting allow me to get on the same creative page with the group, but it would also be a chance to meet with another set of folks from Sesame Workshop. I want to be more than just an anonymous freelancer uploading and downloading work. I understand that relationships are important to getting future work.\nHow much of this is based on personality and how much of this is just ol' fashioned common sense? I think it weighs heavier towards common sense. As if to provide the opposite to my story above, I heard of another animation artist who scuttled his working relationship with a new client after he came in for a meeting and then decided to bill them for it. This instantly caused a squabble and this artist was told that if he kept the charge for the meeting on his bill, they would pay it, but would not work with him again. The artist chose to be paid and kissed the relationship goodbye. Subsequently another artist got the job and worked on that particular project for almost a whole year. The industry will have its up and downs, but the greatest risk we face is making our own personal droughts.\nEach of us IS different, but better sense can be adapted by all. Personality helps and hurts in different turns and factors in to what jobs are the right and wrong fits for us. For one of my long-term flash series directing jobs, I later found out that the producers also interviewed another experienced director who had several flash series to his name, while I had none. The producers told me that they didn't hire him because he was too much of a football coach personality, while I was mellow and non-threatening. My personality helped me win that day, but this \"football coach\" director has continued on with his own great career. Clearly, he's a great fit for many employers, football coach-style and all.\nGood sense and sound judgment can be learned, but only if a person is open to learning from their own mistakes. A closed off person with an old-school \"the producers or client is always out to screw me\" attitude is not going to get far. And if they do get far, they will have had to be the most talented person in the room. That's not an option available to me, so I've always pushed other skills, learned other lessons, and kept applying them forward. The mistakes I've made can fill a book (actually, three!), which only proves that mistakes don't have to be career-killers, unless we decide that they are.\nFurthermore at the panel discussion, some wondered what will happen as India and South Korea (and others) gear up to build strong animation industries. \"They're going to take our jobs,\" many worried. I say, that's only possible if there's such a thing as \"our jobs.\" I argue that there is NOT. There are no agreed upon jobs that are ours for the taking or that can be reserved for us like a rental car. Not on an individual level, nor a city-wide level, nor a national level. We have to reach out for those jobs...to create them ourselves. There's no such thing as entitlement. Just because we decided to be journeymen animation artists doesn't mean the industry owes us squat. This can be empowering if you let it. That's how I think. Who can say I'm wrong? It's my view of the universe and it holds true in my own head, and it helps me survive and navigate this difficult industry.\nSome in the audience bemoaned NYC animation as primarily a preschool animation city. And, while many of the series have been preschool shows, there have also been older kids shows made here such as Sheep in the Big City, Codename: Kids Next Door, Kappa Mikey, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Doug, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There has also been a batch of \"adult\" or animation for tweens in the form of Beavis and Butthead, The Head, Celebrity Death Match, Daria, Downtown, Fridays, The Venture Bros., Super Jail, Assy McGee, Gary the Rat, and This Just In. This city is what we make it. If your goal is to make animation for a different audience, then the ball is in your court. If you succeed, it may not change the perception of NY animation over night, but it will be a step in a different direction. Everything is a first until it isn't. Feature animation was not a reality in this country until Disney made it happen. No British rock band had ever broken through to the American market until The Beatles. The first one through the door has a tendency to leave the door open for what comes next.\nDon't get me wrong, I don't have solid plans myself. I never have. I don't assume to know what I will be able to accomplish. I have assorted goals, but none of them have expiration dates on them. So, the only direction I have in my career is that I am going after my goals. Each day I work towards achieving them. And, I don't look at external obstacles as my problem. In my own head, the state of NY Animation is a perpetually a green traffic light.\nMonday, April 20, 2009\nWhy have I stayed in NY... instead of \"heading west young man?\" It's an interesting question to ponder, although its rare that I think about this. I never set out to be a booster of the NY animation scene. I was born here. My dad earned a terrific living as top Advertising Art director and executive (at one point he was even a vice president at Benton & Bowles), so I saw one could survive and thrive working in the commercial arts in the NY area. There was only one thing against me. No, it wasn't the anemic NY animation industry. It was my own underdeveloped talents. Spending four years at SVA didn't change that, and that was no fault to SVA. It was my own stubborn refusal to work hard enough to challenge myself. In fact, I didn't even know I had made that choice. But, choices are often made silently, aren't they?\nWhen I was privileged with the opportunity to work at Michael Sporn's studio it was both at once a rarified experience as well as typical to New York animation. Rare in that Michael's studio (then and now) tackled animation from beginning to end. No outsourcing like much of the production at MTV, Jumbo, Curious, 4Kids, Scholastic, World Leaders, (and others that have since come and gone). Here was a place to learn it all from top to bottom, because of a supportive boss like Michael and the wonderful staff that followed his lead. I soon had the opportunity to try my hand at storyboards, designs, animation, writing...all within the two year period I worked at his studio.\nWhile this would have indeed been rare to get this variety of experience at some NY studios in such a short amount of time, it WAS representative of a key an aspect of NY animation. Namely; flexibility. Getting to do different things on different projects. That's something I have never taken for granted. It still tickles me that I get to do that.\nNo, I'm not a character designer in the Phil Rynda sense (he is amazing, by the way.) Just check out http://philrynda.blogspot.com/\nBut, by being in NYC animation I get design opportunties just the same. I recently whipped out the above 3 designs after sesame workshop hired me to animate a 30 second spot. They wanted to see lots of different design approaches so I spent two or three days exploring some possible styles. They loved one particular design (not shown above) so much that they asked me to just animate that character as it was drawn. These fun little gigs, they seem very \"NYC animation\" to me. It's part of our blend of the independent and the commercial. Michael Sporn, his disciples, and those of the other NY botique-style animation studios (Buzzco, JJs, Asterisk, Wachtenheim and Marianetti, etc) are the true face of NY animation. They are the survivors that remain as the big studios come and go.\nSo, in NY animation we find ourselves with a happy problem. What to call oneself? Am I a director? A filmmaker? A designer? A writer? An author? A teacher? An animator? A jack of all trades but a master of none? To some, I'm simply the president of ASIFA-East. But, in NY animation, one doesn't have to choose one label. And, by some absurd turn of fate, this formerly raw SVA graduate is now paid to do all of these things (well, except the president of ASIFA-East thing). Why have I stayed in NY? Where else could one have such a career? And, best of all, I could list more than a hundred people just like me. Only chances are, they will be better designers.\nMonday, April 13, 2009\nI have been an adjunct teacher since 2003. That was the year that Richard O'Connor recommended me to Parsons School of Design to temporarily take over a class he was teaching. I was deep in my \"land of milk and honey\" Blue's Clue's job, which turned out to be almost 8 years of end-to-end employment. Back then, I wasn't hurting for money, and it would have been very easy to turn the teaching down. Most of my colleagues weren't teaching on the side. A small handful were. Teaching is something that had always been on my personal fear list and therefore it was something I had to do. If something is a new experience, it's probably something useful. In fact, animation producer Tina Moglia just told my career class that her only factor to stay on a job is, \"Am I learning anything?\"\nSo, how do you get an opportunity to teach? First of all, work in the industry. Local schools such as Parsons, Pratt, SVA, and NYU don't require that an adjunct teacher have a Master's degree or even a Bachelor's degree. You only need to be a working professional and that includes most of us! The next thing to do is to be an active member of the animation community. Let others see you running events, making films, and volunteering for organization's like ASIFA-East. This will grow your profile and show that you are reliable and able to juggle multiple tasks. Thirdly, tell animation teachers you know that you're interested in teaching. Current teachers are often the first ones to hear about positions opening. Usually, current teachers get a crack at the first new opportunities, but not all of them are a good fit, and many times a teacher will be able to pass the lead on to their contacts. Lastly, you can also try to set up a meeting with the head of the school's animation department and present yourself as a potential teacher.\nThe interesting thing about teaching one class is that it tends to mushroom into several classes, perhaps even spread over different schools. Just six months after taking on my first class at Parsons, Machi Tantillo recommended that I take over her Animation Career class at SVA. It was the class that inadvertently launched me as an author when my class plan spun off for the book, Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive (Allworth Press). A couple of years later, John Canemaker brought me in as temporary teacher at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, at which I will return to teach a pair of classes this year. School's like to give multiple classes to teachers that are already proven commodities, which only makes sense. But, new teachers crack through every so often, so try to make yourself one of the success stories by following the plan above.\nThe income that my first class brought in (teaching one 15-week class pays about $3,000) wasn't something I needed in 2003. But, it sure helped me in 2004 when I returned to the freelance life for 10 months, and again in 2007 to the present day when I became a full-time at-home freelancer. Income-wise, teaching has become a life-line, a guaranteed check that I can count on. It represents the very least amount of money I can make in a tough year such as 2009. The other nice thing about teaching is how it flexible it can be. Many times, the teacher can suggest a day and time that works best for them. When possible, I try to do most of my teaching at 6 PM classes, and that way when I have a full time in-house job, the class won't interfere.\nMost of all, I really appreciate the way teaching puts me into contact with the upcoming generations of animation artists. It's inspiring to see the work they do and then to see them achieving success in the industry upon graduation. Its nice to know that, as a teacher, you had some small part in that. Not all the work an animation artist takes on in a career is work we can feel proud of...but, I find teaching has always been a rewarding experience. It's become a vital part of my career cocktail. Its the lime in my gin and tonic. A small part, but one the makes a big contribution to the whole.\nMonday, April 6, 2009\n*Note: image above from Janet Perlman's film, HotSeat.\nI never know what will touch a nerve in my SVA animation career class. So, I was very pleased when a healthy debate erupted based on the \"Desktop Dilemma\" section of Chapter 7 in my book, \"Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive.\" Assuming you have the book (I can dream, can't I?), I'll give you a minute to look that section up. In short, it was a cautionary tale of how an animation artist could damage his reputation by adorning his wall space and desktop computer with swim suit models and scantily clad teen starlets.\nLook at any studio's animation cubicles and offices and you'll find personal items such as posters, toys, family photos, doodles, and other decorations at most every workstation. The stuff we surround ourselves with projects an image. Its a public display of our tastes, humor, and personality. But, how much should one share at the workplace? Even when it comes to the creative workspaces in this industry?\nIn response to the \"Desktop Dilemma\" story above, one female class member explained that if she sees pictures in the workplace that objectify woman, it feels like a personal attack. It makes her feel as if she is being looked at as a sexual object around the office.\nThe particulars of office culture comes into play when trying to understand this complicated issue. A preschool series tends to have young children, mothers, child development specialists, and female network executives walking through the office on a regular basis. Its easy to understand why it would not be desirable to have anything potentially offensive on display.\nOne male student objected and felt that the images described in \"Desktop Dilemma\" were not offensive to him... and, besides, another studio in town that animates edgy adult swim and comedy central series' had much worse on their walls. The difference, I explained, was that the edgy studio was an independent company, set up to reflect the taste and personality of its owner. For some, that might be reason enough to not want to work there. Not everyone is the right fit for every situation. And, on the male students first point (he did not understand what was offensive about swimsuit pictures), I told him the issue wasn't his personal definition of what was offensive. Instead, the point is to be sensitive that somebody else \"might\" take offense.\nI'm not sure I got this point across either. Later that night (after class), a trusted friend suggested that for men that didn't understand what could be offensive about female swimsuit pictures posted at the office,...maybe they would understand it in other terms that might be offensive to them. There's a long list of potentially offensive material that I wouldn't recommend displaying in the workplace: images that are racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, homophobic, etc. Think of the what might offend you and understand that there are some women who might be offended by your sports illustrated swim suit calendar or copies of Maxim magazine.\nThe bottom line is that the office, desk, chairs, stapler, computers, and walls, are not your property. You are only keeping the seat warm for the length of time you are on a project. You are working in someone else's home in a highly collaborative process staffed by men and women of all kinds.\nI tried one last time to reach this male student. I asked him, \"Is it worth the risk of harming your reputation to prove a point that you're entitled to express yourself no-matter-what the circumstances? Not quite sure if this was understood either, I asked, \"What are your goals on a job? Are you there to conduct a sociological experiment to determine what percent of a staff might be offended by your wall-hangings?...Or, are you there to be an animation artist working in harmony with the rest of the team?", "id": "<urn:uuid:af3f2529-c626-409a-8e68-50644b3a6d39>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://animondays.blogspot.com/2009_04_01_archive.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9817075133323669, "token_count": 4288, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean; Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "This is the second article in a four-part series . . .\nI cannot emphasize this point enough, so get ready. I REALLY like it when everything goes my way. I have to admit it feels good just to see those words in print, think about what they mean, and envision instances in the past where it has happened. Living a favored life . . . seems like it would be the be-all end-all of what would end up being a truly wonderful life.\nNow there is a favored lifestyle I think any one of us could get used to. I have read of Presidents past and First Ladies too, who have noted that lifestyle as one of the greatest perks of being in that office. Everything kept spotless, great food prepared by world-class chefs, beautiful art and artifacts, wonderfully appointed rooms and furniture, and on and on and on the list goes.

How cool is all that!?!\nEverywhere you go the roads and/or the sky is cleared, and people make way. While we may not get to have that life, we do try in our own ways. We get the best house we can, the best car we can afford, and whatever else we think will make us happy in this life. We accumulate these things around us, and consider ourselves blessed with what we have. Granted, some people are of meager means and do the best they can with what they have, while others can afford quite a bit more, but in the end, we all eventually become used to whatever life we have. We content ourselves and call ourselves blessed and highly favored, and there is nothing wrong with that.\nExcept . . . we are not here to live a favored life.\nA whole lot of Christian men will have gone to church this past Sunday. Some wear really nice clothes while others simply wear the best clothes they have. They carry their Bible under their arm, a smile on their face, shake hands and make small-talk with everyone they meet, keep the kids in line, and sit with their wife. They stand up and sit down at all the right times, sing when it is time, listen attentively to the preacher, and when it is all said and done, they go home. They love their church, their pastor, and consider themselves blessed and highly favored, and there is nothing wrong with that.\nExcept . . . we are not here to live a favored life.\nAgain, let me repeat and be very clear. There is NOTHING WRONG with having things in this life. There is not a single “thou shalt not” when it comes to having a nice home, a nice car, nice clothes, and whatever else there is in this life. There is no commandment against having and living a favored life, however, when that becomes the focus and reason for living, that is when things get off-line.\nLuke 12:16 “And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. 20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?”\nThere is a time for the favored life. Where would a baby be without the favored life? However, every child must grow up. The favored life is not something we should seek to keep permanent. Understanding that all belongs to God and that everything God has given us should be used in His service, then we begin to see a greater purpose for the things we have in this life.\nClinging to the Favored Christian life is not God’s plan or purpose for your life. When things get just a little “out of favor” how do you respond? Do you find yourself asking, “What’s wrong, Lord?!” “Why me!?!” Do you try to hold on to the favored life you are living? When things go “wrong” do you try to make them “right” again according to the life you want? Is God trying to teach you or show you something? What if there is something greater than the Favored Christian life to be had?\nReposted from www.MenRising.com\nThis is the first article in a four-part series . . .\nWhen does a man truly fail? What makes a failure complete?\nI remember being a young man truly afraid of getting my report card. I was six years old and in first grade, and I had no idea how grades came to appear on the report card or what they were based on other than someone else's idea of whether or not I had \"done well in school\" for some time period. The report card came in small yellow envelopes of the kind you'd find in most offices when something official needs to be transported from here to there. I remember carrying mine home with a heavy hand.\nI suddenly recounted all the things I had been in trouble for up to that point . . . throwing rocks in the playground . . . spitting water when it was my turn for a drink at the water fountain . . . not staying in line when walking between the classroom and the playground . . . and on and on it went. When I handed my report card to my mother, she began to read down the list of topics I had only heard in the classroom, and was not sure exactly what they meant. Reading - A, Math - A, Penmanship - A (there was a ship?!) and when she came to the bottom of the list I had gotten all A's.\nGlad that was over with, I simply went on my way. The next report card, however, did not come back so good. I had a B and a C, and although I was not sure what that meant, I knew from my dad's reaction that it was not good. The third report card came back with an F on it, and that is when my dad took me into the back room for a talk.\nIs the letter \"F\" for \"Failure\", stamped anywhere on your life? Unfortunately, many Christians have this letter stamped on their life, and not by God, but either by themselves or even more unfortunately, by other Christians. The failed Christian life happens when we do what we know is wrong, but it's not merely getting out of line at the water fountain. It can be much worse.\nInfidelity in a marriage is the biggest one that springs to my mind because it seems to be the most abhorrent and prevalent in churches. However, there are other ways to get the big \"F\" stamped onto your life. For some, it is simply failing to meet expectations. Whether you set them or had them placed on your life, a broken expectation can feel so much like a broken promise that disappoints those around us. However you get it, chances are high that you may be walking around with an \"F\" stamped on your Christian life. The worst thing about it is it feels permanently engraved there.\nHow do you know a man has accepted that mark? He stops going to church. He stops reading his Bible. He may even stop trying to talk with God. \"God cannot use me\" is the message in his heart, and that message can be reinforced in cruel ways by others.\nBack to my questions: When does a man truly fail? What makes a failure complete?\nThrough the year of first grade, I was able to bring my grades back up. The lower grades turned back into B's and A's. In the end, I was no failure. I still had the marks of the past to show for the lack of performance, but it was in the past. The only mark that mattered was the one at the end of the year. The only way that mark of an \"F\" would have been my undoing is if I had ceased to try. If I had accepted the \"F\" as permanent the moment it appeared, that would have been my moment of real failure.\nToo many Christians today live the Failed Christian life, not because of the mark of Failure, but because they have accepted that mark as permanent, and have stopped trying. What is more, there are too many other Christians out there all too ready to remind them of the mark. Though life has moved on, they continue to point their finger into the past - \"Failure\" is on their lips every time they say hello, and the engraving grows a little deeper.\nWe do not have to live the Failed Christian life though. All we have to do is keep trying. Peter fell beneath the waves, cut off a man's ear, denied Christ three times, and still lived a very successful Christian life . . . because he understood . . . a man only truly fails when he fails to keep trying. Then, his failure is complete.\nReposted from www.MenRising.com\n“Humble me, Lord.” How different would your Christian walk and spiritual life be if you prayed that prayer every day and meant it? What would it look like if God were to humble you?\nTwo stories stick out in my mind when it comes to humility, and both of them have to do with tanks. The first story comes from a soldier on the battle field of World War One, called The Great War at the time (there had not yet been a World War II), tanks were just really beginning to come into their own as a tool on the battlefield. Before tanks, armies would line up on either side, and dig in with mazes of trenches with barb wire and machine gun nests. In between them was “No Man’s Land” which was a space of land neither side held, and where both sides had equal access to fire the full force of their weapons.\nWhen the tank came along, it changed all that. As a soldier recalled his first encounter with a tank, he said the experience was both terrifying and humbling. All the prepared defenses were useless. The tank rolled through No Man’s Land, through the machine gun fire, over the barbed wire, and caved in the trenches on top of the men who were underneath. Lines of soldiers followed, and his unit was in an immediate state if disarray.\nThe second story takes me back to June 4, 1989. In Beijing China, in a plaza called Tian-an-men Square, students rose up in protest, and were fired upon and killed by Chinese government forces. At one point, after much of the square has been cleared, tanks begin to roll into the square. A single column of tanks grinds to a halt, not because of overwhelming opposition, but because one single man resolved to block them or be overrun, stands in their way.\nAs he stands there, the tanks rolling directly up to him, I am the one humbled. He stands there in protest, and we can only assume because of the events preceding he is there on behalf of the Chinese students previously murdered by their own government. In my mind, he also personifies humility in the sense that he has come to the point that, in his own mind, he has given up everything. Had he any reservation within himself for himself or the things he owned on this earth, doubtless he would not have been there, yet there he stood.\nI wonder how many Christians would be willing to make such a stand. Too many times, even I admit I am too preoccupied with the things of this world, trying to hold onto the status quo of my own life, trying to do the day-to-day things that make ends meet, and sometimes I forget what my real mission in life is as a Christian. It is worth remembering these stories, because if we pray “Humble me, Lord” it may just happen that God sends a tank over the defensive lines in our lives we have so carefully prepared, so that we may hold no thing on this earth in reserve in a stand for Him.\nHow different would your life be if you sincerely prayed, “Humble me, Lord” every day?\n- reposed from www.MenRising.com\nDoes God fail? A better question might be, has God ever failed you? As Christian men, our knee jerk reaction may be something along the lines of “God never fails” or “God has never failed me.” I am not here to argue the point, because I would agree with you, however, the way we live our lives sometimes testifies differently than what we have proclaimed with our mouths.\nI do not know anyone who has not been affected by the economic turmoil these days. If you have not been personally affected, then you know someone who has. Statistically speaking, it would be impossible for you not to fall into one of those two categories because of the immensity of the problem. Does God know about it? Does God understand how it is affecting you or someone you know? Has God failed? Has God failed you?\nWho is your God?\nIs your God someone you can count on or not?\nIn times of greatest distress, I think many of us wonder if we can still count on God. It is the reality of being human. There is a circle of people out there with a very cynical view of God, but their wondering and musing can be helpful when we ask the question, “Who is your God?” I was watching TV the other night when a guy came on asking the question, “Is God in control of everything or not?” As I listened, he began to cite the many things that are attributed to the work of God, such as tsunamis and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.\nHe then assumed that, well yes, God is in control of all those things. Because God, being all powerful could have prevented any of them, yet for whatever reason, chose not to do so. Without missing a beat, he then cited God for all the other tragedies in the world, and ended with God giving aids to babies in Africa. Whatever your reaction to these accusations of God, that is the perception of God to people who refuse to believe God exists. It begs the question: who is your God?\nI am reminded by the words of a goodie but oldie hymn called “A Mighty Fortress.” For those who have never heard of it, here is the first stanza of that song:\nA mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;\nour helper he amid the flood of mortal ills prevaling.\nFor still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;\nhis craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate,\non earth is not his equal.\nWhat those who choose to not believe in God will never understand is that while Christians may never be able to prove to their satisfaction that God is real, there is great peace and power in accepting and knowing that God does exist. God does care, and while we may not understand the tragedies in the vapor of existence we call life, we know that God has never failed us, and that God never fails.\nIsaiah 14:24 “The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:”\nReposted from www.MenRising.com\nSuppose I gave you a jar of yellow gumballs with this simple instruction: you are to separate one gumball from the rest without isolating it from the others. Could you do it? As soon as you take one gumball out of the bunch, it is separated, but now it is also isolated. As soon as you put it back in, it once again becomes neither separated or isolated.\nCan something or someone be separated without being isolated? It is a question worth asking because it drives at the core of the meaning of holiness. As Christians are we to be a holy, separated people, or are we to be a holy, isolated people?\nHow you look at your Christian life through either of these two possibilities will determine how you relate to the world around you. From two different pastors I heard the following two statements: “Church is not for the saved, it is for the lost to come and hear the Gospel” and “Church is not for the lost, it is for the saved to come and learn how to live a life pleasing to God.” As I took in and thought over these two statements, I could not see anything wrong with either of them except for their exclusive stance toward a particular group. In truth, church should be for the saved AND the lost.\nThe church should be a place where the lost feel welcome and where the Gospel can be planted in their hearts, however, it should also be a place where Christians feel comfortable bringing their families because they know that the teachings will help all of them learn to live a holy life pleasing to God.\nGoing back to the example of the gumballs, what if you were to take one gumball out, change it’s color, and then place it back in the jar. Would it then be separated? Well, it would certainly be different, and it would stand out. It would also no longer be isolated.\n1Peter 2:9 “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:” John 9:5 “As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”\nIf we are in the world and no different than the world, then I propose that we are not separated, or to use another word, holy. To be holy is to be different in a way that gives honor and glory to God instead of bringing attention to ourselves. If we are so different that we isolate ourselves, and the world has no interaction with us, then they cannot see God in us in that way either. We may as well be a gumball wrapped in opaque packaging completely cut-of from any interaction, definitely separated, but also just another form of isolation.\nThere must be balance. We cannot hope to influence a lost world if we isolate ourselves from them, nor can we be the light to a world if we are no different than they are. That balance, that distinction between being separated and isolated, that characteristic that points to God instead of ourselves, that is what I believe is holiness.\nReposted from www.MenRising.com", "id": "<urn:uuid:66dea464-c1fd-4299-93fa-2bfb5f4cf633>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://annistonstar.com/pages/blogs_faithandfamily/push?per_page=5&class=&rel=prev&x_page=14&instance=gamecock", "date": "2013-05-18T08:04:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9790070056915283, "token_count": 3983, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "By Jim Hopf\nOwners of the (556 MW) Kewaunee nuclear plant in Wisconsin recently announced that they will be closing the plant, because it was losing money and they were unable to find another company willing to buy it.\nThe reason the plant is losing money is that it is in a “merchant” power market, in which the price of electricity is governed by the cost of electricity from natural gas plants (those plants being the last, highest-variable cost, incremental supplier). Due to the current very low cost of natural gas, as well as weak demand due to a sluggish economy, the market price for electricity in those regions is very low. On top of this is the fact that small, one-unit plants like Kewaunee have relatively high operating costs, since many costs (including many of those associated with regulatory compliance, site security, etc.) do not scale down with plant size.\nUnfortunately, it is possible that Kewaunee may not be the last plant to close for purely economic reasons. Many experts are saying that several other small plants in merchant power markets (including Vermont Yankee, Fitzpatrick, Nine Mile Point, Cooper, Ginna, Indian Point, and Clinton) are at risk of closing, due to weak demand and continuing low natural gas prices.\nIn addition to plants that may close for economic reasons, a few other reactors will or may close due to equipment problems. Based on estimates of $2–$3 billion to repair the Crystal River plant’s containment dome, Duke decided to close the Florida plant. Low natural gas prices almost certainly factored into that decision.\nMeanwhile, the San Onofre plant in California has been offline for over a year due to tube failures in recently-installed steam generators that were based on a new design (that turned out to be problematic). Apparently (and surprisingly) it will take 4-6 years for new stream generators “that could pass regulatory muster” to be fabricated and installed. The utility is seeking Nuclear Regulatory Commission permission to run one of the two idled reactors at 70% power, based on analyses that show additional tube wear will not occur under those conditions.\nLow gas prices likely temporary\nAlthough many voices are saying that low natural gas prices (not much higher than current levels of $3–$4 per million BTU) will last for a long time, there are many reasons why this is unlikely to be true. The four main reasons are summarized below:\n- The price of natural gas is 4-6 times lower than that of oil, on a per unit energy (BTU) basis. Given that oil and gas are interchangeable for many uses/applications, such a difference in energy-equivalent price is unsustainable. In fact, plans are underway, as we speak, to use natural gas in the transport sector, mainly for large trucks and fleet vehicles. There are also plans to build Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) refineries that convert natural gas into clean diesel fuel.\n- The price of US natural gas ($3-$4/MBTU) is a factor of 3 to 4 times lower than what gas (LNG) sells for abroad, with Europe paying over $12/MBTU and Japan/Asia currently paying over $16/MBTU for LNG imports. Plans to export US gas are being made as we speak. Such exports will even out worldwide gas prices, and lead to significantly higher US prices.\n- The price of natural gas is very sensitive to the balance between supply and demand, and demand should increase measurably in the coming years as the economy recovers.\n- Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the current price of natural gas is actually much lower than the raw cost of gas production for most US shale fields. This is clearly unsustainable. In fact, there has recently been a major shift in drilling activity (and drilling equipment) from gas to oil, since oil production is so much more profitable, given the much higher price for oil. Given the high decline rates for shale gas wells, any let up in exploration or the drilling of new wells will soon lead to declining production.\nIn addition to the above four reasons is the likelihood that increased (tightened) requirements will be placed on shale drilling operations, either by the Environmental Protection Agency or the states themselves, in order to protect groundwater and reduce air pollution. Such requirements would also result in somewhat higher production costs. Of course, if a price or limit on CO2 emissions is ever imposed, it would make existing nuclear plants more competitive vs. gas plants. Finally, it must be noted that new EPA pollution regulations are leading to a significant number of coal plant closures. Most of this coal capacity will be replaced by gas generation. The resultant increase in US gas demand will also put upward pressure on gas prices.\nGiven this, it seems likely that the unprofitability of the nuclear plants in question will be temporary; probably only a few years. For this reason, many nuclear plant owners (e.g., Exelon) have stated that they are not currently planning to close any plants. Thus, some of the plants listed earlier may not close, despite a negative short term situation. Given the likely short term nature of the situation, any such closures would be very unfortunate, and shortsighted.\nCan anything be done?\nThe closure of nuclear plants like Kewaunee and Crystal River will have a devastating effect on the local economy, due to lost local jobs and a greatly reduced local tax base. As a result, some political efforts are being made to avoid closure. In Kewaunee’s case, a local legislator is proposing that nuclear qualify under the state’s renewable (or clean energy) portfolio standard. Depending on the details, and their design, however, many such proposals may not provide the assistance that the plant needs to remain open. As stated by the Kewaunee utility, what the plant really needed was a long-term power purchase agreement at an adequate price.\nIt would seem that the best solution would be to develop a means to either support the price or reduce operating costs, over the next few years, or somehow arrange (or incentivise) a power purchase agreement that would last for at least a few years.\nPower price supports\nOne option would be for the government (federal, state, or local) to provide a minor level of price support for the plant’s power, with the understanding that such support would be only temporary (i.e., a few years). Given the current financial state of the federal government, any such support may be unlikely. However, given the negative local impacts of the plants’ closures, it may be in lower-level governments’ interest to offer some limited support, if it were enough to keep the plants open. Such governments would have to weigh the cost of any support against the permanent loss of local employment and tax base. The situation is analogous to how local areas offer economic incentives to attract large employers in the first place.\nAs for how a “price support” would work, one could take a cue from the support given to renewable energy over the years. Such government support has often taken the form of above market prices paid to renewable suppliers, or using “renewable energy certificates” to attain a renewable generation goal, and allowing renewable generators to sell those certificates (at a price determined by the market). In one way or another, the (local) government would pay off the difference between the market price for power and an agreed-upon price that the plant needs.\nAnother option would be to arrange for some type of power purchase agreement. Either the government would add some type of incentive for a private power consumer to enter into such an agreement with the plant, at least for a few years, or the government itself could enter into such a power purchase agreement with the plant. If the government’s own power demand is not large enough to use all the plant’s output, it could sell off any remaining power to private consumers at market rates (presumably at some loss to the government, that is, until gas prices go back up).\nMany may say that such measures would be too expensive, that governments can’t afford it, or that any such interventions in the free market are not justified. It seems to me that the support these plants need is smaller in both magnitude and duration than the support that has been given to many renewable energy projects, in the form of operating subsidies or mandates for their use, regardless of cost (with power consumers being forced to pay the higher costs).\nIn terms of securing cost-stable, reliable, domestic, pollution-free, CO2-free base load generation for the long term, these may be among the most cost effective measures ever taken. In addition to preserving local employment and tax base, they would reduce the region’s vulnerability to natural gas price swings/spikes in the future. Call it a (temporary) subsidy on all (new or existing) emissions-free generation. It should be easier to justify than much larger renewable generation subsidies.\nAnother option for keeping plants in operation would be measures to reduce their operating costs (or at least prevent them from increasing) for at least the next few years. Such measures could be removed in a few years, after the market price for power has recovered, and the plants can afford higher costs.\nOne example would be to delay any expensive Fukushima-related upgrades for plants that are currently barely profitable or (temporarily) unprofitable. After a several-year grace period, the plant would be required to make the upgrades. If the market price for power has still not recovered (due to gas prices not going up), then the plant would close if the upgrades would render it unprofitable.\nAs I discussed in my last post, requirements that result in the closure of nuclear plants, and their replacement by fossil-fueled generation (even gas) does not reduce public health and environmental risks; it actually increases them. Also, it’s not as though there is no precedent for such policies. After the Clean Air Act passed in 1970, the coal industry managed to get many (if not most) of its existing plants exempted (grandfathered) from the new law’s much stricter requirements. The argument was that it would not make economic sense to retrofit old plants that would only be operating for a few more years anyway. It turns out that they kept operating those older plants (whose emissions of various pollutants are many, many times that allowed by the 1970 Clean Air Act) for 40 more years, and counting….\nNote how there is no such thing as a “grandfather clause” for the nuclear industry, with respect to Fukushima upgrades or requirements in general (anything that NRC thinks is important). At a minimum, backfits are required if justified by cost-benefit analysis (something that is not required for grandfathered coal plants, where the benefits of CAA-mandated pollution controls greatly exceed any costs). Another difference is the fact that the overall public health and environmental risk/harm from the grandfathered coal plants is orders of magnitude larger than any from a nuclear plant without Fukushima upgrades (especially given the lack of earthquake and tsunami potential at all the sites in question).\nOn a more general note, with respect to Fukushima, I definitely agree that many intelligent, cost-effective measures should be taken in response to the lessons learned from the event. However, we’ve also learned that even a worst-case plant accident event (with multiple meltdowns followed by essentially a failure of containment) caused no deaths and is projected to have no measurable health impact. In other words, the public health impacts are FAR smaller than what had been previously assumed, as the basis for current regulatory policy. Given this, while I agree that some specific upgrades should be made in response to Fukushima, I’m wondering what requirements we should also consider paring back, given the much smaller potential impacts. Are any new cost-benefit analyses being performed?\nTo my knowledge, the NRC isn’t considering taking any steps in that direction. This is unfortunate, since some carefully-considered, strategic paring of certain requirements could possibly prevent plant closures, and may make nuclear more competitive in general, resulting in reduced use of (harmful) fossil fuels in the future. (Note that this would not be analogous to EPA relaxing pollution requirements so that coal plants could remain open, in that any replacement generation for old coal plants would be environmentally superior, whereas when a nuclear plant closes, its [fossil] replacement is environmentally inferior.)\nIn a similar vein, aside from Fukushima upgrades, one could explore other ways to reduce operating costs at small, vulnerable plants. Apparently, the operating cost for some of these plants (e.g., Ginna) is $40/MWh; much higher than the under $20/MWh operating cost that I was always told applies to existing nuclear plants. This must be due, in part, to their small size and single-unit nature. That said, one still has to ask why their operating costs are so high. I’m guessing that their staffing, per MW, is extremely high; higher than most nuclear plants and much higher than that of fossil plants (the 556 MW Kewaunee plant employed 655 people). In my personal opinion, the industry (e.g., INPO), Kewaunee plant operators, and the NRC should sit down and figure out why the staffing (and operating costs) are so high, and try to figure out a responsible way to reduce them. At least that much effort should be made to keep these plants open, given the impacts on the local economy and the long-term impacts on the environment, energy costs, and energy security. The industry needs to make more of an effort on this.\nThe Kewaunee plant is only ~5 miles from the larger, two-unit Point Beach nuclear plant. Both are pressurized water reactors. One question I have is why the plants could not be effectively managed and operated like a three-unit site, given the proximity. Are there any jobs/tasks at Kewaunee that could be handled by Point Beach personnel, or vice versa? I realize that this would result in staff reductions and lost jobs, but losing some jobs is better than losing them all. I also wonder if Kewaunee plant staff considered any wage/benefits concessions, or if management considered offering them before closing the plant and laying everyone off.\nOne other option for temporarily unprofitable plants would be to mothball them for a few years, then reopen them when the market price for power recovers. The problem is that, due to various requirements (regulatory, etc.), it’s expensive to maintain a shutdown nuclear plant. If the owners give up the operating license, and switch over to a (“possession only”) license that applies to a decommissioned reactor state, it would be very expensive to gain permission to restart the plant. As a result, no nuclear plant that has been formally shutdown has ever been restarted.\nThis is one more thing that seems to be unique to the nuclear industry. Restarting a coal plant is much easier. In fact, while coal’s percentage of US generation has fallen from ~50% to ~32% over the last year or so, due to very low gas prices, utilities (e.g., Southern) have stated that they will switch many of those coal plants right back on once natural gas prices recover (i.e., once it is even slightly less expensive to run the coal plant, regardless of the much greater level of pollution). Some disincentive to pollute, which would at least raise the natural gas price at which utilities would switch old, highly-polluting coal plants back on, is clearly needed.\nThis is another area where some review of current policies is in order, in my opinion. As things stand, it is far too difficult and expensive to pull a closed nuclear plant back out of mothballs, and/or to maintain a plant in a “mothballed” state. I don’t really understand why maintaining the option of restarting a nuclear plant should make it that much more expensive to maintain a plant in a shutdown state. It’s not as though the risks and potential for release (from stored spent fuel, etc..) are any greater. Reform/scrutiny in this area should be more palatable than my earlier suggestions about paring requirements for operating plants, given the lower potential risks present during the long-term shutdown state.\nAnyway, mothballing the plant is another option that should be studied by the local governments, the utility, and the NRC. If local governments want to keep the option of restarting the plant, they should try to find a way to make it happen (i.e., make it worthwhile for the utility).\nCrystal River and San Onofre\nUnlike plants like Kewaunee, the Crystal River plant is probably a lost cause given the (inexplicably) huge cost of repairing its containment dome. I still have to ask why no cost-benefit analysis is being done on the option of operating the plant in its current state. (It’s likely that the costs of repair greatly exceed any public health or economic risk reduction benefits.) I also feel compelled to point out that even if the plant were operated in its current (unrepaired) state, its overall risk to public health and the environment in the local area would be much smaller than that posed by the four coal units at the same site, that are going to continue to operate.\nAs for San Onofre, I am not sure what “that pass regulatory muster” means. Does it refer to installing generators of the old design, or does it refer to years of analysis (paralysis)? I have to ask why it will take 4–6 years to replace the steam generators (a piece of industrial heat exchange equipment). Does the replacement of large heat exchangers in any other industry take anywhere near this long?\nAlso, news reports are saying that the NRC is having some problem allowing the plant (steam generator?) to run at 70% because 100% was the design basis. I’m having trouble understanding how legal (licensing) issues could be a significant impediment. The engineering issues, i.e., the assertion that the steam generators can operate at that power level without further tube degradation, clearly need to be analyzed, but they should (expeditiously) perform the necessary engineering evaluations and move on.\nWhatever these issues are, the NRC (and the utility) need to do what it takes to resolve them, in months not years. This is especially true given that to make up for the loss of San Onofre’s generation, they are firing up two old, dirty fossil units in the area; units that had been retired due to the fact that they did not meet current air pollution requirements, among other factors. Thus, the longer they delay, the greater the (real) impacts on public health in the region (as well as CO2 emissions) from those fossil units.\nIs this beginning to sound like a theme? Going to the ends of the earth to avoid/reduce small nuclear risks, and ignoring much larger risks from fossil generation; fossil generation that is often being used to replace nuclear generation that is closed due to the relentless quest to reduce nuclear risks to zero.\nJim Hopf is a senior nuclear engineer with more than 20 years of experience in shielding and criticality analysis and design for spent fuel dry storage and transportation systems.

{"text": "Written by County Comptroller Howard S. Weitzman Thursday, 04 June 2009 15:34\nHealthcare issues have always been at the forefront of my policy initiatives, both as County Comptroller and during the 35 years spent in the healthcare field. Throughout my two terms, I have been a squeaky wheel when it comes to finding ways to trim the escalating costs of Nassau County’s health benefits. Several years ago I persuaded the County Legislature to eliminate the practice of offering two family health benefit policies to one family, to lengthen the number of years of employment required to vest lifetime retiree health benefits and to increase the health benefit buy back amount to encourage employees with other coverage options to drop County health benefits.\nLast year County Executive Tom Suozzi and I released a report showing that the New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) was over-collecting premiums from local governments and had accumulated an excessive $540 million on top of statutory reserves. The State agreed and applied some of the excessive premium to keep the 2009 rate increase to an average 1 percent, instead of the 7 percent originally forecasted by NYSHIP. This effort saved Nassau County taxpayers approximately $11 million in health insurance premiums for 2009 and approximately $116 million for local schools and governments. I will also be working to recoup a portion of the excess NYSHIP premiums charged in prior years – an amount equal to $540 million statewide and $21 million for Nassau County, that could be made as a one month premium holiday for all NYSHIP participants. The vast majority of Nassau’s schools and local governments also participate in NYSHIP.\nRecently I received an appointment to the New York State Health Insurance Program Participating Agency Advisory Council (PAAC). This is good news for taxpayers because now I will have the ear of the people who make the policies. Nassau County is the largest local government participating agency in NYSHIP and prior to my appointment, no one from Nassau County had served on the board! The Council also includes representatives from other participating agencies, such as local school districts. Nassau County Director of Risk Management John Brooks was also named to the PAAC.\nAs a member of this council I will continue my call (and the use of my squeaky wheel) for an outside review of NYSHIP because I believe there are many more opportunities for savings and I look forward to serving Nassau County.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2c4e23a0-636a-4ec2-8720-2d30e8ff4ec8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://antonnews.com/plainviewoldbethpageherald/opinion/820-comptrollers-report-june-5-2009.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:25:07Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9623841047286987, "token_count": 487, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "What's... this? A guest post?\nHello! I know most of you come to this blog to read about quilting, and stuff like that, but this time you're in store for something a little different.\nMy name is Lauren, and I'm Sarah's daughter. I'm fourteen years old, and I know next to nothing about quilting. Not nothing.... I mean, I've lived with a quilter my entire life. But certainly not enough to write a blog post on the subject. So instead, I decided to write about my mom! That's the natural thing to do... right?\nSo here goes nothing....\n14 Relatively Unknown Things About My Mom\n1.She's really crazy and funny when she wants you to take cough medicine.\nI've had a cold for about two weeks now. It's no fun. The medicine I have to take is absolutely revolting. I hate it . It's nasty stuff. It usually takes me a little while to pshych myself up to drink the stuff. One night, Mom and I were standing in the kitchen while I was trying to take my meds. It was late, it was cold, and mom didn't want to be there much longer. So, in an effort to hurry me along in the process of drinking that horrible liquid, she started to motivate me by saying : \" Up and..... BACK! Down the....... HATCH!!!\"\n2. If she hurts herself, she must show you ... repeatedly.\nNot just once or twice, oh no.\nEvery chance she gets.\nBecause she wants you to feel bad for her. And of course you do, but after being shown her injury twenty times....\n3. She sometimes yells at people when she's driving.\nYes, I realize that lots of people do this.\nMom doesn't say anything bad.\nShe says things like \" Get out of the way B-hole!\" then she turns to me,\n\" That b-hole better get outta the way!\"\nShe actually says \" B-hole\" . Not butt hole, she'd never say that.\nOkay, maybe she would.\n4. She's the only mom who stays to watch us at dance.\nMy sister and I dance quite a bit. I have dance five days a week now. Needless to say, we're at the dance studio a good amount of time. Mom's out there everyday, sitting on the bench, cross stitching in hand, watching us dance. None of the other moms are ever there. They don't watch their kids dance. I mean, sure, they're there sometimes. But no one has yet to come close to spending as much time at the dance studio as mom does.\n5. Any story from her childhood is set in third grade.\nOkay, so not any story.\nBut a good chunk of them. So much of them... almost all of them. Her stories usually go a little something like this\nMom:\" One time when I was a kid....\"\nMe: \" Was this in third grade?\"\nMom: \" ......Yes.\"\n6. She is obsessed with Thor.\nYou know ,Thor.\nThe mythical Norse god of thunder.\nShe doesn't just like Thor... she has a Thor doll, a Thor pez dispenser, and lots of other assorted Thor goodies.Of course she does.\n7. She's always watching old movies.\nAlways. It bothered me a bit when I was little... but they've started to grow on me....\n8.She HATES shopping of any kind.\nActually, she doesn't hate shopping for yarn or fabric so.....\n8A. She HATES shopping ....... unless it's for fabric or yarn.\n9.She's absolutely horrible at video games.\nThis is a big one for my little sister. She's really good at video games.\nMom.... not so much. When she's playing a game, she has a hard time maneuvering both her head and her torso at the same time....\n10. She has an irrational disdain for old fashioned police cars.\nThey make her sick.\n11. \" Can I get a few of those snacker things.... what are they called?\"\nThis was an actual conversation between my mom and the drive through lady at KFC.\n12. She loves Honey Boo Boo.\nThis is actually fairly new.\nFor those of you who aren't in the know, Honey Boo Boo is a seven year old pageant girl.\nShe was in the show \" Toddlers and Tiaras\" . Apparently, people liked her , because now she has her own spin off show.\nPersonally, I'm not that interested in the show. Sure, she's a cute and funny kid.... mom on the other hand, says she wants to adopt Honey Boo Boo.\n13. She has lots of weird dolls.\nLots of them.\nJust the other day, she got a package in the mail . The interchange between her and me went a little something like this :\nMe: \" What's in this?\"\nMom : \" It's my blue vampoodle. Did you happen to see the envelope that has my tiny elf baby?\"\n14. An often used phrase of her's : \" I cut your grapes in half!!\"\nShe says this whenever she feels the need to remind us of the kindness she did us by cutting our grapes in half when we were babies.\n\" I kept you alive!\"\nWell folks, that's my list.\nI had fun, and I hope you did as well.This list could have gone on longer, but I think this will suffice.These are some of my favorite wacky things about my mom. I love my wacky mom.\nSo in the hopes that she doesn't rebuttle by sharing embarrassing stories from my childhood, I shall bid you all adeu.\nUntil next time,\nLauren ( AKA Big sis)", "id": "<urn:uuid:45818e25-563a-40db-83f1-1dcbeeccb5bf>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://anyonecanquilt.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/10/index.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.978670060634613, "token_count": 1235, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

You've got 30 seconds and you're trying to get them refocused and they're all thinking about other things.\"\nAfter the no-call on the block/goaltend, Kris Joseph snared the crucial rebound for Syracuse but lost the ball out of bounds with 6.2 seconds left, prompting a tirade from coach Jim Boeheim and giving West Virginia one last shot.\nUnable to drive the lane as planned, Jabarie Hinds passed to Kevin Jones in the left corner as C.J. Fair stormed at him, and his desperation 3 at the buzzer fell short.\n\"We beat ourselves,\" Gary Browne said. \"We've dug ourselves in a hole where we aren't supposed to be. We feel hurt right now. This loss hurt us a lot.\"\nSyracuse won its second straight after losing at Notre Dame and did so despite being hammered 41-20 on the boards, 24-9 in the second half, and missing 16-of-20 3-point attempts. Still, there was a battle for every loose ball under the baskets and the Mountaineers only finished with a 13-8 edge on second-chance points, not much to show for a 19-5 edge on the offensive glass.\n\"This was one of those games where if you don't make shots, it's going to come down to who makes a play at the end,\" Boeheim said.\nSyracuse (22-1, 9-1 Big East) has won 13 of the past 14 games against West Virginia (15-7, 5-4). The win was the 878th for Boeheim, moving him within one of tying former North Carolina coach Dean Smith for third in Division I history.\nJoseph finished with 13 points and seven rebounds, Scoop Jardine had nine points and five assists and Dion Waiters had eight points for the Orange, who played their third game without Melo.\nThe 7-foot center, who leads the Big East in blocks, watched the game from the bench in street clothes, shouting encouragement at his teammates. After starting the first 20 games of the season and becoming a force in the paint, the big Brazilian has not played since logging 29 minutes in a home win over Pitt nearly two weeks ago. Melo is ineligible because of academic issues but has been practicing with the team, and Boeheim is hopeful he'll be able to return to the lineup.\nJones led West Virginia with 20 points and eight rebounds. Bryant had 12 points, all in the second half, and Browne scored 11.\nThe Mountaineers were coming off a 78-62 loss at St. John's on Wednesday night, a game in which the Red Storm started five freshmen, but they led most of the first half in this one and never trailed by more than three points in the final 17 minutes.\nSyracuse led by four to start the second half and made it 33-27 on Triche's steal and layup with 18:57 to go. After that, it was anybody's game. The score was tied seven times, the last when Jones hit a 3 from the left corner to knot it at 61 with 1:41 left.\n\"They do a great job of playing defense,\" Joseph said. \"We found ways around that at the end. We did what we needed to.\"\nThe Orange were hampered by fouls to their big men. Keita picked up his fourth midway through the half and 6-9 freshman Rakeem Christmas fouled out with 4:58 to go.\nSyracuse trailed most of the first half as the Mountaineers patiently attacked the 2-3 zone. Jones started the game by hitting consecutive mid-range jumpers from the heart of the Syracuse defense.\nThe Mountaineers led by six three times, the last at 22-16 after a 3-pointer by Jones from the left wing with 7:34 left, but they converted only one other basket in the closing minutes — a runner by Hinds — as Syracuse increased the defensive intensity with a press.\nThe Orange forced shot-clock violations on consecutive possessions in the final 3 minutes and Joseph's baseline drive and layup gave Syracuse a 25-24 lead with 68 seconds left, just the Orange's second lead of the half.\nWaiters fed Jardine for a wide-open 3 from the right corner with 3.2 seconds left to give Syracuse a 28-24 halftime lead. It was just the second make in 11 tries from behind the arc for the Orange, who have struggled from long range in conference play, shooting 25 percent in the last six games.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8b8d90d8-44bf-4f76-b3e5-81c1a87309bf>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2012-01-28/syracuse-beats-west-virginia-on-missed-goaltending-call?modid=recommended_2_4", "date": "2013-05-18T06:32:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9804148077964783, "token_count": 1360, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "It happens during coaching changes, one of the aspects of the business.\nThe outgoing coach assembles a recruiting class but the incoming coach has other players in mind. Butch Jones left Cincinnati for Tennessee and when Tommy Tuberville replaced Jones, he wanted to bring recruits with him, especially at quarterback.\nThat left Massillon (Ohio) native Kyle Kempt high and dry. Most quarterbacks are done with recruiting well before National Signing Day and Kempt was no exception — he picked the Bearcats nearly a year ago. This late in the recruiting cycle, there are few scholarships left for quarterbacks at BCS schools. So if the school you're committed to has a coaching change, it can leave a recruit like Kempt with few options.\nThis weekend, Kempt might have found an even better home than Cincinnati. Oregon State was nationally ranked in the 2012 season and in the Pac-12, a better conference than the Big East. Kempt got his last-second offer and committed on the spot.\nWanna thank God through all this, I'm keeping the orange and black and committing to Oregon State! Go Beavs!— Kyle Kempt (@KyleKempt) Jan. 27, 2013\nBefore picking Cincinnati, Kempt had offers from Indiana, Ole Miss, Tennessee, West Virginia, Toledo and Bowling Green — but many of those options dried up months ago after he picked the Bearcats.\nKempt broke down his strengths to Sporting News in an interview given last year.\n\"There are a couple common things colleges are impressed with when they break down my film,\" Kempt told Sporting News. \"They like that I have a strong arm, make good decisions with the football, I'm accurate with my throws and I have a good pocket presence … Being a student of the game, studying film constantly, that's a strength.

{"text": "DENVER— The Denver Broncos have parted ways with versatile but vexing linebacker D.J. Williams.\nThe Broncos released the nine-year veteran Monday on the eve of free agency, freeing up his $6 million salary in 2013 for other needs.\n\"We appreciate the contributions made by D.J. Williams during his time with the Broncos,\" John Elway, vice president of football operations, said in a statement. \"He was a solid player with this team for a number of years, showing a lot of versatility at linebacker. Our organization wishes D.J. all the best going forward.\"\nThe Broncos also have asked Pro Bowl defensive end Elvis Dumervil to take a pay cut. If not, he'll be traded or released before Saturday when his $12 million salary for 2013 becomes guaranteed. Dumervil is also due $10 million in 2014 and $8 million in 2015.\nWilliams missed nine games while serving a pair of NFL-mandated suspensions last season and was deemed expendable after Wesley Woodyard had a breakout season at weakside linebacker in Jack Del Rio's defense.\nThe Broncos also released third quarterback Caleb Hanie, a former Colorado State star who didn't take a single snap in his one season in Denver following four years as the backup in Chicago.\nThe Broncos were busy on many fronts Monday, finalizing a three-year deal to keep backup safety David Bruton, their top special teams player, and working to keep defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson in navy and orange before the start of free agency Tuesday.\nWilliams' departure is notable because he and cornerback Champ Bailey were the longest-tenured Broncos, their careers in Denver dating back to Mike Shanahan's time as coach.\nWilliams was a first-round draft pick (17th overall) out of the University of Miami in 2004 and played four different linebacker positions during his nine seasons in Denver, where he led the team in tackles five times.\n\"It's the nature of the business,\" Bruton said about Williams' release. \"Guys change, things change. D.J. is still a young player. He was a great teammate. He'll definitely make it somewhere and he'll continue to make plays because whenever he stepped on the field here, he made plays. Best of luck to him. He's been a great player and a good teammate. Just, his time was up here.\"\nWilliams is one of only five NFL players during the last nine seasons to post at least 800 tackles and 20 sacks, and he displayed his versatility by starting at the weakside, middle, strongside and inside positions for a revolving door of defensive coordinators and schemes in Denver.\nHe turns 31 this summer and is sure to draw interest on the open market but he is coming off a season in which he collected just 14 tackles in seven games and only made one start because of his two suspensions that cost him about $4 million in salary and relegated him to playing on special teams and in sub packages upon his return in November.\nWilliams was suspended six games for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs and three games for an alcohol-related arrest in 2010 that led to a conviction last August.\nHe was originally charged with driving under the influence, but a jury convicted him of the lesser charge of driving while impaired. He was also convicted of driving without headlights, the offense that prompted police to stop him near downtown Denver in the early morning hours on Nov. 12, 2010, before taking him to a detox facility.\nThe Broncos stripped Williams of his captaincy shortly after his arrest — the second time he'd been detained for suspicion of drunken driving. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to impaired driving.\nA judge last fall sentenced him to 30 days of house arrest and two years' probation.\nWilliams also made news last summer by tweeting a picture of his new digital playbook and saying his coaches were asking him to switch positions yet again.\nIf Dumervil follows Williams out the door, the Broncos will have some big shoes to fill on a defense that was one of the NFL's stingiest last season.\n\"It's always important to keep a defense together,\" Bruton said. \"This is the first time having the same defensive coordinator in my career here. So I feel like that's a great step in the right direction. But teams change, players change. We just don't want to change that mentality no matter who we bring in.\n\"As far as me worrying, I don't have to worry as much anymore. You still worry who they bring in, because the NFL is a revolving door. Guys come in, guys come out. It's just the nature of the business.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:77943aaf-7acc-4b62-8f7f-78d8d3169bc5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2013-03-11/dj-williams-released-by-denver-broncos", "date": "2013-05-18T06:30:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9858317971229553, "token_count": 953, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Monday, January 25, 2010, 05:30 pm\nNotes of interest from Apple's Q1 2010 conference callThe first quarter of Apple's 2010 fiscal year was another record breaking three-month frame for the company, which sold more Macs and iPhones than ever before. Monday, the company conducted a financial conference call with analysts and the press, and notes of interest follow.\nOn Monday, Apple revealed the results of its fiscal 2010 first quarter, which ended Dec. 26, 2009. The company posted revenue of $15.68 billion and a net quarterly profit of $3.38 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. That's an increase from revenue of $11.88 billion and net quarterly profit of $2.26 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago frame.\nApple's blowout quarter surpassed its previous quarterly record by almost $3.5 billion.\nParticipating on Monday's call were Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer and Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook.\nApple's regional business segments\nThe real standout in Apple's worldwide business breakdown was the fact that international sales accounted for 58 percent of the company's revenue. The largest overseas slice came from Europe, which accounted for $5.024 billion in revenue, partially from sales of 1.068 million Macs.\nMac sales in Italy, France, Switzerland and Spain all grew more than 40 percent. Australia up over 70 percent, China up almost 100 percent.\nApple Americas garnered $6.092 billion in total from the U.S., including sales of 1.187 million Macs. In all, 3.362 million Macs were sold in the quarter.\nAsia Pacific accounted for $1.183 billion, including sales of 313,000 Macs. And Japan was $783 million, selling 105,000 computers.\nApple's \"Other Music Related Products and Services\" segment was responsible for $1.164 billion in revenue. Apple's \"Peripherals and Other Hardware\" added $469 million in revenue.\nThe company's \"iPhone and related products and services\" accounted for $5.578 billion in revenue, based on sales of 8.737 million units. Apple's \"Software, Service and Other Sales\" segment produced $631 million.\n$39.8B in cash at the end of the Dec. quarter, an increase of 5 billion from the previous quarter.\nApple's Mac business\nMac sales were broken down into 2.128 million portables, and 1.234 million desktops. Desktop sales were up 70 percent year-over-year, and saw a 60 percent increase in revenue. They also spiked 57 percent in sales from the previous quarter. Customers are thrilled with the new iMacs, officials said.\nPortable sales were also up 18 percent in sales year over year, and 9 percent in revenue. However, the notebook market was down 6 percent in units and 5 percent in revenue from the previous quarter. Mac and MacBook sales were up 16 percent year over year in education. New December records for K-12 and high-ed channels.\nCook said that represented the best growth rate for education since before the recession began.\n\"Our whole education business is based on we really understand teaching and learning and student achievement at a deep level, we think we're the only company that really gets it, we do more than sell boxes like other companies do,\" he said. \"I think we can continue to do well and was thrilled to see the results from last quarter.\"\nPrevious Mac record was set in September quarter, Apple beat it this quarter by almost 300K. Grew more than 30 percent year over year.\n\"We are extremely proud of this result and believe our Mac hardware and software are providing outstanding software and innovation that our customers really love,\" Oppenheimer said.\nApple's iPhone and Apple TV businesses\nRecord 8.7 million iPhones sold Revenue for iPhone handset sales, accessories, and carrier payments was $5.58 billion.\nAverage Selling Price of about $620 for the iPhone during the quarter.

However, Cook declined to comment on whether the \"halo\" effect applied to iPod use in the consumer markets could lead to Mac adoption in the corporate world.\nMore than 200,000 iPhones have been sold in China with carrier China Unicom. Cook said Apple is concentrating now on the customer experience and point of sales.\n\"We would prefer to move slow because we're building the brand for the long term and we're very much focused on the long-term of the market, because we think there is significant potential there,\" Cook said. He declined to forecast where sales could go.\nCook also defended the company's approval process for the App Store, noting that more than 90 percent of software submitted is approved within 14 days of submission. He said some rejections are to prevent inappropriate content, like pornography.\n\"Most of the rejections, however, are actually bugs in the code itself,\" Cook said. \"This is protecting the customer and the developer to a great extent, because they don't want customers who are unhappy with the app.\"\nApple's iPod business\nSold almost 21 million iPods. iPod average selling price increased 9 percent, revenue increased 1 percent. Share remains at almost 70 percent. iPod is the top-selling MP3 player, and gains share internationally.

As noted by Bloomberg, the nature of the complaint was not revealed in the notice, and the document is not yet available to view.\nThe new complaint, numbered 2828, is categorized with \"Portable Electronic Devices and Related Software.\" Named as proposed respondents are HTC Corp., of China., HTC America Inc. of Bellevue, Wash.\nAsking the ITC to ban the import of devices is standard practice when a lawsuit is filed. Similar motions were made in legal spats Apple has had with Nokia and Samsung.\nApple first sued HTC in the ITC in March of 2010, and accused the Taiwanese company of infringing on 20 patents related to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. In a statement, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said though competition is \"healthy,\" competitors should not \"steal\" Apple's technology.\nThough the suit was directed at HTC, the complaint specifically targeted a number of phones that run Google's Android mobile operating system, leading many to believe the real purpose of the complaint was to serve as a warning shot toward Google. For its part, HTC fired back with its own lawsuit, accusing Apple of infringing on five patents.\nThe first complaint filed by Apple against HTC is set to be decided on by a judge on Aug. 5. The findings will the be subject to review by the full commission.\nHTC saw an early victory in the case in April, when the ITC staff voiced it support for the company as the trial began. The staff made the non-binding recommendation in favor of HTC, but the actual ruling will be made by ITC Administrative Law Judge Carl Charneski next month, and will then be reviewed by the six-member commission.\nOn Topic: patents\n- Apple's iPhone e-wallet concept suggests payment options based on context\n- Apple's 'social camera flash' connects multiple iPhones, iPads to light a scene\n- Apple patent lets users control a device with taps, thumps and scratches\n- Apple wins utility patent for MacBook's trackpad design\n- Judge orders Google to hand over search documents in Samsung patent case", "id": "<urn:uuid:5ba41725-74c0-4832-b611-e16863cc8c4c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/07/11/apple_asks_itc_to_block_import_of_htc_handsets_in_latest_patent_complaint.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:02:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9594846963882446, "token_count": 515, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

View the audio archives.\n- Created 15 October 2010; Published 1 November 2010Convocation: R. Dale Guthrie\nProfessor emeritus at the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, R. Dale Guthrie is a renowned paleobiologist and artist. His many books and papers have covered a wide range of interests, including evolutionary dwarfing, social anatomy, causes of extinctions, climatic change and human evolution. In the past few decades his lifelong hunting experience and hobbies of painting and sculpting have dovetailed with his scientific interests, leading to his landmark study, The Natural History of Paleolithic Art.\nPrior to Guthrie's book there was no widespread practice of using information and ideas from natural history and studies of human universals in approaching the thousands of art images made by members of Eurasian Ice Age bands. The cave paintings and other preserved remnants of Paleolithic peoples shed light on a world little known to us. With a natural historian's keen eye for observation, and as one who has spent a lifetime using bones and other excavated materials to piece together past human behavior and environments, Guthrie demonstrates that Paleolithic art is a mode of expression we can comprehend to a remarkable degree and that the perspective of natural history is integral to that comprehension. He employs a mix of ethology, evolutionary biology, and human universals, along with innovative forensic techniques, to access these distant cultures and their art and artifacts.\nThe title of Dr. Guthrie's presentation was \"Evolution of Art, Morality, and Romantic Love in the Ice Age Human Band.\"\n- Created 1 October 2010; Published 6 October 2010Convocation: Rudolph Byrd\nThe Goodrich C.

She grew up a self-hating young woman, entering one abusive relationship after another. She became a heroin user, went to prison for possession of the drug and was raped and beaten before she began her long contemplative journey to change. She later began her journalism career at the Miami News, and worked for sixteen years as a reporter with the Washington Post, where she carved a niche for herself focusing on human-interest stories that reflected current issues. During this time she spent six years researching a notorious Washington, D.C. murder for which eight young men remain incarcerated. Her work on the story raised serious doubts about the guilt of the youths and showed readers the absolute power wielded by police and prosecutors. This story plus her own experience with the judicial and penal systems sparked her to begin speaking on the states of those systems today, including the high rate of incarceration among minorities and the poor, questionable police practices, prosecutors with too much power, and the weeding out of bad lawyers.

{"text": "Late Night Trivia\nWhat is LNT?\nLate Night Trivia is a four-hour student-organized trivia and activity-based competition broadcast on KRLX 88.1 FM on the first day of Reading Days each winter term. The format is the same from year to year but changes minute to minute.\nLNT will be held on Tuesday, March 12th, 2013 from 7:00PM to 11:00PM this year!\nHere's what happens:\n- A trivia question is asked over the radio, and then a song is played.\n- Teams have until the end of that song to answer the question asked before the song and identify the song and artist.\n- Fourish \"Action Trivias\" are announced throughout the night; they involve sending a contingent from (or all of) your team to a specified location and performing a specified task, usually involve acting something out, building something, or consuming something.\n- Fourish \"Medleys\" (a series of sounds spliced together) are also played throughout the competition; your job is to identify the correct elements from these compilations, elements that can range from who's talking, who's singing, or what's happening.\n- The Stumper is the crème de la crème of LNT; a series of clues (usually with a relatively simple answer) which gradually decreases in difficultly. The Stumper is worth major points but its worth scales down with each team that gets it right. Translation: the first team to get The Stumper gets the most points, the 2nd team to get it gets the 2nd most points, 3rd team 3rd most points, and so on.\n- The headquarters of LNT this year is Sayles 251.\nHow do you win?\n- The first team to correctly answer each question gets a prize as does the first team to identify the song and artist.\n- Each question, song, \"Action Trivia,\" \"Medley,\" The Stumper, and bribe is worth points and at the end of the night top teams win mediocre / absurdly thrilling prizes.\n- The most spirited team according to The Gods wins the privilege to sign their team name on the LNT Spirit Trophy.\n- Bribes will be requested by The Gods over the air throughout the competition in Sayles 251; the teams who can deliver the desired item(s) to them will receive bonus points.\n- To see the official scoring rules go here.\nHave some important phone numbers:\n- To register and find out your very important team number in the hour before LNT starts, call x5622\n- During LNT, to answer a question or identify a song or artist, call x4127\n- During LNT, to answer The Stumper or a \"Medley,\" call x5622\nA note about competitive spirit:\n- While the Gods have no way to control how you choose to identify and discover the songs that we play, in the spirit of LNT, we encourage you to partake in the thrill of the hunt and work actively with your own knowledge and with the tools that can aid that knowledge instead of letting some device or program steal the fun from you.\n- Teams can be any size.\n- Teams can be any combination of students. Floor teams tend to do well but so do clubs that play together or just a group of friends.\n- You must register your team during the hour (6 P.M - 7 P.M) before LNT begins by calling the phone number above and giving your team name and a contact phone number in order to get your official team number. This official team number must be used to identify your team when calling in answers, performing \"Action Trivias,\" giving The Gods gifts, or answering The Stumper so make sure your whole team knows this official team number.\nEmail holewind for more information.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f10d69d3-9dee-4d79-80d0-bcdb8969b238>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://apps.carleton.edu/student/orgs/latenighttrivia/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:02:07Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9434384107589722, "token_count": 800, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "July 13, 2012\nThe Lord is coming soon.\nUnmarked helicopters, hovering.\nThey said it was a weather balloon.\nNote: Today’s episode of Archie Kobain was filmed on a closed track using professional drivers. Do not attempt this on your own.\nAnd speaking of strippers…\nMy gig is up. That’s right – my true identity has been revealed. I must admit, I am a little ashamed of not having come clean earlier. After all, so many have said to me, “you look so familiar – where do I know you from?” But… No. I maintained my silence. Well, now it’s all out there in the open.\nUndoubtedly, you’ve all recognized me from my younger days when I worked in the adult entertainment industry. On screen, of course. That’s right. It’s me. It turns out that I am not locked away in a Ukrainian prison and, despite the rumors, I was not killed in a bizarre New York fetish club accident involving three chickens, Scott Stapp (the guy from Creed), and Krysten Ritter.\nTruth is, I started that rumor.\nBesides, there were only two chickens. But I digress…\nThe bottom line is that, my identity has been revealed and that’s OK. Instead of hiding, I have decided to embrace who I really am. Therefore, from this moment on, I will only answer to my official porn-star name, Loco Helicopter.\nI know. That’s the first thing that people ask…\n“Loco, just what did you have to do to earn that name?”\nAll I am aloud to say is – rent one of my films.\nJesus, Barry & Joe…\nOK, so I came across the strangest thing the other day. Someone had taken a piece of poster-board, some magic markers and made themselves a sign that said, “Jesus + Obama + Biden = Jobs”. Then they took this sign and affixed it to the trunk lid of their car using duct tape.\nI know. I can’t believe I didn’t get a photo, either…\nSo, what is one to do with this great information. My first thought was make up my own sign and park next to them. My sign was going to contain some similarly arbitrary information like, “Krishna + Mandela + Gore = Gates”.\nName of a (somewhat) prominent religious figure + the names of two random politicians = the last name of a prominent technology figurehead. Of course, they went with Jobs, who is dead and I went with Gates, who is believed to still be alive.\nNext, since Jesus didn’t really have a last name and we just knew him as - Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph, of the family of David – don’t you think they should have gone with all first names? Like “Jesus + Barack + Joe = Steve” …or in the case that they were actually talking about jobs, as in creating jobs or otherwise performing work, ”Jesus + Barack + Joe = Jobs”.\n…but that leads to an entirely different set of issues. First of all, I think we can all agree that, if Jesus were here today, he’d be a republican. Don’t you think? How awkward would it be if he wasn’t?\nIn any case, I don’t think Jesus is looking for a job. He has a job. He’s been doing that same gig for a few thousand years. He’s locked into that job worse than The Pope. Obama and Biden on the other hand, I think they’re headed for the unemployment line (personally) but maybe that’s just me.\nIsn’t someone supposed to throw a net over me if I seem to be headed off on a tangent with no point? Barnsley?\nMusical Guest? Sure. We have time.\nSo you think you can dance…\nYou know how every once in a while, I put you onto a song or an artist and then you just can’t get enough of them? C’mon! You know it happens. Remember Yacht? …or Robyn? Well, get ready for Butterfly.\nButterfly Boucher that is – and that is her real name. Yes, really. And I’m totally addicted to her stuff. All her stuff… her music, her look. Oh, yeah baby. I likes me some Butterfly and I think you will too. Please enjoy…\nFrom her recently released, self-titled album…here’s Butterfly Boucher and 5678!\nUh, huh? What’d you think? I know. She’s awesome.\nSo, get this. She co-produced Missy Higgins’ new album. True dat.\nAnd if you’re like me. You want some more, don’t cha? Well, go buy her stuff.\nIn the meantime, here’s a little fun with Butterfly & Missy…\nI know, right? I want strawberries and champagne. How is that gay?\nWhat was your favorite part?\nI can’t decide but I think it was Missy’s dancing.\nGet your mind out of the gutter. B-man. Barnsley’s favorite part was, “two hot chicks on a bed with instruments, making noise”. Of course, he said it with his British accent, which somehow makes it seem less inappropriate.\nAnd speaking of redheads…\nOne of my readers came up with a brilliant idea. He said, “Hey Arch (He didn’t know to call me Loco, at the time), Why don’t you have a Redhead of the Week”. I know. The guy is a genius. At first I thought it was a little too Mariachi Static but then I thought, isn’t everything?\nWe’ll be starting that next week. I was going to start it this week but today we’re going to feature Super Girl and I didn’t want her taking away any of the glam & glory from our very first Redhead of the Week. So, for now, enjoy this photo of what will mostly likely be our one and only ever, Super Girl of the Week…\nSupergirl – everyone should have one.\n…then, be sure to tune in next week for the launch of our exciting new segment.\nAnyway, it’s time to wrap this thing up. We’re ending a another broadcast day. You’ve been a lovely crowd. You don’t have to go home but… well… on second thought, YES. Yes you do… Go home!\nJune 29, 2012\nWelcome back my friends.\nThis installement of Archie Kobain is brought to you by…\nAnd by that I mean that I had to have several shots of this fine Vulcan nectar, in order to write this week’s installment. By the way, if you haven’t had Don Julio 70, their Limited Edition 70th Anniversary tequila, you REALLY should. It’s magically delicious. It kicks Lucky Charms’ ass on being magically delicious.\nNot that there’s anything wrong with that…\nOK, so… At the risk of being ostracized by the G&L community, as a journalist, I feel that I have the responsibility to report the facts (or fiction) as I see them. Agreed?\nSo, not too long ago, I’m talking to a friend of mine who got himself into one of those awkward situations that most of us only dream of being in…or not. Somehow, he manages to be find himself at Disney’s EPCOT center, sometime near the end of May or early June during what they call, “Gay Days”. It is important to note that, my friend is not gay.\nNevertheless, there he is and completely unaware of the situation. Also, he is wearing a red shirt, which (apparently) is one of the outward symbols of comradery or general, uh, gayness….supposedly.\nWell, next thing you know, he’s at one of the drinking establishments, uh – drinking – most likely at the Rose & Crown in the United Kingdom – and he strikes up a conversation with a couple of good looking ladies. Of course, they were there together. Yes, together like that.\nNevertheless, one of them is trying to pick up my friend. She tells him that she is gay, the other girl is her girl friend, but – get this – she has been thinking of “experimenting”. OK, that’s fine. But she’s hitting on my friend, thinking that he’s gay. That doesn’t even make any sense. If you wanted to experiment, you need a straight guy. Otherwise, you are trying to convert a gay guy, to experiment with – that’s not a very good experiment. That’s like trying to convert ham back into pork because you don’t feel like driving to your local BBQ joint… What???\nAbout this time, my friend has figured out what’s going on. Now he’s trying to convince everyone that he’s not gay…but they aren’t buying this. After all, he’s there, wearing the red shirt, and talking to the lesbians. All the while he’s thinking – and I have to quote him…\n“Trying to pickup lesbians, how is that gay?”\nThere are so many things wrong with that statement.\nBut at the end of the day, my friend believes that he has discovered a secret society, a subculture of closet heterosexuals within the gay and lesbian community. Think about it.\nOK now stop thinking about it.\nI’m going to stop before readers turn haters, turn lynch mob on me.\nBut speaking of people with unclear sexual preferences, if you’ve been with me for a while, you know I love Missy Higgins but I bet you didn’t know this… She had taken a few years off from making music. The articles I’ve read seem to indicate that she was suffering from depression and had even given up on music all together, in spite of her international success. Well, she’s back, and…\nOur little girl is all grown up…\nMissy has a new album locked, loaded and ready to go, “The Ol’ Razzle Dazzle”. It releases in the US on July 17th, with an album launch party at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. See you there, Missy. Although, maybe I’ll catch you in Nashville or at Red Rocks.\nHey that’s pretty cool.\nI called someone Missy, and that was actually her name.\nOK, so… Be prepared to be blown away.\nI promised not to talk about this song anymore, so I won’t say it, but…\nGuess who Missy is touring with? Guess? And guess who she fills in for sometimes?\nDid you guess?\nYeah… I’m definitely going to Red Rocks.\nAnd yeah, that was Missy. Is she looking hot or what?\nAnd just so we all agree, this Gotye guy, he’s getting laid a lot, right?\nBut enough about him and that damned song that I’m not supposed to be talking about. Let’s talk more about Missy. After all, this week’s musical guest is Melissa Morrison Higgins.

{"text": "One of the problems with life is dealing with change. Nothing is static. Everything is constantly changing. While that has always been true, the pace of change has accelerated in modern times. The volume of changes that seem to have some impact on us has gone up, and the awareness of change has intensified. We are constantly told that newer and better stuff is now available, to replace the stuff we just bought yesterday, which we may not have had a chance to use yet. We live in an era where we now measure things in internet time. Stability and constancy are old-fashioned virtues. This is a hallmark of technology and is particularly true when dealing with computers and software. Open source software is no exception; in fact, quite the opposite is true. Drupal and WordPress have different schemes for how they drive change into their user communities and offer different facilities to their users to comprehend and administration change. These differences are not inconsequential.\nIn this post I’m going to discuss a new viewpoint on requirements that I haven’t mentioned before: architecturally significant requirements (ASRs); and I’m going to cover a few hot button elements on my evaluation of Drupal and WordPress for architectedfutures.net.\nWhat Are Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs)?\nArchitecturally significant requirements are those requirements that play an important role in determining the architecture of the system. Such requirements require special attention. Not all requirements have equal significance with regards to the architecture.\nASRs are either functional or non-functional requirements (see part 1). What makes them significant is the impact they have on the architectural solution. If the ASRs aren’t satisfied the customer, the user, isn’t just inconvenienced, the solution doesn’t work; it doesn’t do the job. The architecture is wrong for the problem. It doesn’t provide a solid and stable solution, or it fails to please the user in how it achieves its function. Deciding what is architecturally significant is a matter of skill and judgment. Determining how well a particular solution fills requirements, especially before the fact (a priori), is again a matter of skill and judgment.\nASRs are typically defined in terms of key requirements that are the motivating factors in the design of the architecture for the system. Some of these requirements are functional. A lot of these requirements are qualitative. But what does that mean? In the architecture of buildings there is a significant difference between a church, an office building and an airplane manufacturing facility. That’s functional. But the difference between a church, a chapel and a cathedral isn’t so much functional (putting aside the aspect of scale), it’s qualitative. Or compare the differences between a half-dozen major office buildings, or compare a half-dozen architect designed 3 bedroom, 3 bath, two car garage houses. The differences in the architecture of the office buildings, or the houses, isn’t functional so much as qualitative. The same is true of other systems, including software systems and social systems. “What is it?” tends to be about function. The way it gets done, the style, the attitude, tends to be qualitative. And quality matters. Quality can drive durability. Quality can drive satisfaction.\nArchitected Futures Community of Practice ASRs\nFor my evaluation of Drupal versus WordPress (versus whatever) as the technology platform for the Architected Futures Community of Practice (AFCoP), the object being architected is AFCoP, not WordPress or Drupal. I am not writing the specifications for, nor am I designing, Drupal or WordPress. So, I am not trying to define, nor am I overly concerned with WordPress or Drupal ASRs. I am concerned and focused with AFCoP ASRs.\nWhat I’m saying is that things exist in layered, compositional hierarchies. At some point we draw a line around something and that becomes the object of focus. The architected object. The environment it exists in is outside of the object. It may have interactions with other things in that environment, but they are external to the object of concern. You don’t really design your environment. You come to grips with it; you learn to deal with it. As you look at what is inside you decompose the object into parts. If the parts are novel, you may need to design (architect) them. As you do that, you decompose those parts into other parts. If the parts aren’t novel, you can either design new parts, if you feel the need, or you can obtain pre-fabricated parts from a catalog; or you can do a little of each by making adjustments to catalog parts. This is the internal mechanics of the object. However, at some point, you become unconcerned with the details of how the remaining parts work. It stops being a primary issue with respect to operation of the object you are concerned with. The parts just need to do a job. Catalog parts are fine. You don’t want to design how they do that job, as long as the job gets done. If one part doesn’t work to your satisfaction, you swap it out and get another part.\nThere are two layers of architected entities that I am primarily concerned about in the creation of my community of practice.\n- The first, outer layer, is AFCoP – the community of interacting people. This is essentially the architecture of a social system, a Community of Practice. That community will exist in an environment of planet Earth, human beings, the internet, etc. The components involve topics, interaction policies, the involved people, groups and sub-groups, technology for communicating, etc.\n- The inner layer of concern to me is the architecture of the technology platform to support the Community of Practice. The technology platform architecture is a part of the Community of Practice architecture. The platform will be architectedfutures.net. The environment for architectedfutures.net will be the AFCoP community, a hosting service, the internet, external support services, etc. The components of architectedfutures.net will include a lower level (nested) technology platform (WordPress or Drupal), a particular set of add-on modules, etc.\nThe AFCoP technology platform, architectedfutures.net, is an ASR for AFCoP. How well the community is able to interact is critically dependent on the facilities provided by the technology platform. To meet that ASR architectedfutures.net is being designed specifically to meet the needs of AFCoP. This won’t be a social network site for a church group or a book club. It has special requirements to support the mission and focal interest of the Architected Futures™ community. If certain features, some functional, some qualitative, aren’t there, then the success of the community will be jeopardized. In a similar way, the choice of base platform (Drupal, WordPress, some other package, custom code, etc.) is an ASR for architectedfutures.net. The structure, the support requirements and the way the functional capabilities are provided by the infrastructure is a critical factor in the success of architectedfutures.net. But it isn’t all or nothing. The Drupal and WordPress platforms are being evaluated as candidate components to provide the base for architectedfutures.net‘s architecture. Some tasks can be done with either platform, although they may vary somewhat in how they are done. Other tasks or functions aren’t so benign. Their presence or absence may be critical to the community, or the way they are achieved may have a major effect on the community. That impact makes those qualities of the infrastructure architecturally significant to the community of practice. Those are the key qualities I want to focus on in terms of my decision.", "id": "<urn:uuid:884fe6d2-38fb-4304-a44f-da6b118dfed3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://architectedfutures.info/2011/09/21/part-3-asrs-and-riding-the-wave-of-change/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9396666884422302, "token_count": 1635, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "1. Why is extremism an issue in prisons?\nExtremist groups often pose special security risks in prisons. They may encourage the overthrow of the government, and prison officials can be targeted as agents of \"illegal\" government authority. Further, their literature often encourages ethnic hatred, promoting a violent and racially charged prison atmosphere.\nSince the 1980s, white supremacist organizations have spread throughout the American prison system, beginning with the growth of Aryan Brotherhood.1 Aryan Nations, although not permitting inmates to become members, has engaged in \"prison outreach\" since 1979. In 1987, it began publishing a \"prison outreach newsletter\" called The Way to facilitate recruitment. Aryan Nations also disseminates its literature and letters to inmates. The World Church of the Creator and some Identity Church groups engage in similar outreach activity, as do other racist groups, such as Nation of Islam. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nonideological criminal prison gangs are often organized based on race, which increases racial polarization.\nImprisoned extremists also pose a security threat by continuing their activities while incarcerated. They recruit inmates, and teach other inmates extremist tactics. Some imprisoned extremists also have attempted to continue to influence adherents outside of prison by, for instance, publishing newsletters from the prison to maintain their outside following.\nPrison officials have responded in various ways, reflecting the fact that each state has its own prison system (as do cities, counties and the federal government), and that prisons have varying populations. At times, prison officials have tried to limit access to extremist literature, and these responses have occasionally given rise to litigation because they potentially impinge upon inmates' First Amendment rights. The questions are especially complicated when the censored material comes from a group that claims to be religious.\n1 Aryan Brotherhood, at one time associated with Aryan Nations, began as a virulent racist and anti-Semitic prison gang, and has since developed into a crime gang associated with extortion, drug operations and prison violence.\n2. Do inmates have the same First Amendment rights as everybody else?\nThe United States Supreme Court has said that \"prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.\" Nevertheless, inmates' First Amendment rights are less extensive than other citizens' and their rights can be limited due to security or other penological concerns. Because of the particular challenges administrators face running prisons, the Supreme Court has acknowledged there is a compelling government interest which warrants limiting prisoners' rights. Courts have been deferential to prison officials' assessments of security threats, and sensitive to their related regulatory decisions, even if such decisions impact inmates' First Amendment rights.\nA prison regulation that impinges on an inmate's constitutional rights will be upheld in court if that regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. This means that, generally, prison officials can ban extremist materials from prisons because of concerns that the distribution of such material will undermine prison security. Extremist books, leaflets, and magazines have been forbidden to prisoners on this basis. Such material has not been allowed through the mail and has not been kept in the prison library.\nHowever, prisons have less discretion to limit inmates' religious practices than other First Amendment rights due to a new federal law. Because of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), prison officials' discretion in limiting access to extremist material may depend in part on whether such material is related to an inmate's religious exercise. Therefore, prison regulations that affect religious exercise, including access to religious literature, will be reviewed carefully if challenged in court.\n3. What legal standard is used to determine the constitutionality of prison regulations?\nThe Supreme Court announced the standard under which it would review the constitutionality of prison regulations in Turner v. Safley, a case involving a challenge to a complete prohibition on inmate marriage. As noted earlier, a prison regulation is constitutional if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. Under this standard, courts have upheld regulations based on the consideration of certain factors:\n- Is there a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\ninterest put forward to justify it?\n- Are there alternative means of exercising the assert- ed right that remain open to inmates?\n- How great a negative impact will accommodating the inmates' rights have on guards, other inmates,a\nnd on the allocation of prison resources?\nCourts will consider the existence of obvious and easy alternatives to a challenged regulation as evidence of a regulation's arbitrariness.\n4. Is the same legal standard used to determine the constitutionality of prison regulations that implicate an inmate's right to free exercise of religion?\nNo, the same standard is not applicable to determining the constitutionality of prison regulations alleged to violate inmates' free exercise rights. The constitutionality of such regulations is determined under the more stringent standard set forth in RLUIPA. RLUIPA says that the government cannot impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of an inmate, even if the inmate's religious exercise is being limited by a generally applicable rule. However, an inmate's religious practices can be limited if the prison official demonstrates that the regulations in question (i) further a compelling interest and (ii) the same interest cannot be served in a manner that is less restrictive of the inmate's free exercise rights.\nSince RLUIPA was enacted in September 2000, it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. Therefore, how this statute will impact prison regulations that affect inmates' religious exercise remains unclear.\n5. How should prison officials evaluate whether particular material can be withheld from inmates?\nGenerally, the First Amendment does not allow speech to be censored by the government because of the content of that speech. The government can only limit the time, place, and manner of speech. However, because inmates have more limited First Amendment rights than other citizens, some content-based discrimination is allowed for security reasons. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld a prison official's decision to withhold entire issues of the magazine, Muhammad Speaks, because certain articles in the magazine created a danger of violence by advocating racial, religious, or national hatred. This decision was prior to the passage of RLUIPA, and therefore the Court's analysis might be somewhat different today. Under current law, if having the entire magazine withheld was determined to be a substantial burden on inmates' free exercise rights, the Court might require that the offending material be removed rather than the entire issue being withheld.\nRegulations that exclude publications from a prison because of security concerns have been found constitutional when the regulations have required individualized review of any material before it is banned, notification to inmates that the material has been denied, and the possibility of review of such decisions. Courts have tended to find prison regulations that ban all literature from particular groups unconstitutional. However, the determination of the constitutionality of a given regulation or the implementation of the regulation has tended to be very fact-specific. Courts look not only at the regulation at issue but also consider the nature of the prison (high, medium, or low security) and the particular administrative challenges faced by the prison (such as crowding and quantity of incoming mail) in determining reasonableness, or the practical existence of less restrictive alternative measures.\n6. Can prison officials apply the same restrictions to outgoing prison material?\nThe Supreme Court does not allow content regulation with respect to outgoing mail from inmates. While outgoing mail can be searched for contraband,2 content regulation of outgoing mail is also more restricted because it implicates the First Amendment rights of non-prisoner addressees.3 In addition, outgoing material does not pose a threat to internal prison security; therefore content limitations have been considered less urgent. However, regulations can limit the content of outgoing mail categorically. For example, escape plans, threats, running a business, and blackmail are categories that have been disallowed. Therefore, correspondence from prisoners to extremist groups cannot be banned outright because of its content. However, inmates can be prevented from distributing a newsletter from prison when doing so constitutes running a business.\n2 Special rules exist with respect to attorney-client correspondence or mail that implicates an inmate's right to access the courts that are beyond the scope of this discussion.\n3 However, prison officials can forbid all correspondence between incarcerated individuals.\n7. Can extremist \"missionaries\" be prevented from visiting prisons?\nPrison officials can ban categories of prison visitors, such as former inmates or visitors who have previously broken visiting rules. An extremist \"missionary\" can be barred from a prison because of generally applicable rules. In addition, prisons can create procedures for requesting visiting ministers, and impose conditions on the selection of the ministers, such as sponsorship by an outside religious organization. Prison officials can also exclude prison \"missionaries\" if they are advocating violence or otherwise fomenting prison unrest by encouraging racial tension. However, under RLUIPA, the prison would have to show that any restrictions on visiting clergy are the least restrictive means of achieving its end.\nPrison officials do not have a responsibility to hire a minister for each religious denomination represented in the prison population. However, if visiting ministers of one denomination are compensated, visiting ministers of other denominations must be equally compensated. Security limitations can be placed on inmate-led prayer or services, but again, under RLUIPA, the prison would have to show that any restrictions on such gatherings is the least restrictive means of achieving its end. For example, it is more likely that the prison could limit the frequency of such meetings, the number of attendees and require supervision than that such gatherings could be banned outright.\n8. Under what circumstances must prisons accommodate prisoners' religious dietary requirements?\nAccommodating religiously based dietary rules has become an issue when dealing with extremists because incidents have raised concern that extremists \"adopt\" religious practices that are not based on sincere beliefs in order to obtain special privileges, such as specialized diets. Generally, if an inmate's request for a special diet is because of a sincerely held belief and religious in nature, the inmate has a constitutionally protected interest. Under RLUIPA, a request for a special religious diet can only be refused based on a compelling prison interest and if it is the least restrictive means possible for the prison protecting that interest. Prisons may offer more limited food selection to prisoners with religious dietary limitations, such as providing only cold kosher meals rather than hot food. In the past, when determining whether a prison was required to provided a special diet for a prisoner, courts have considered whether the dietary restrictions were central to the prisoner's religious observance. Under RLUIPA, such a determination would probably not be relevant. The threshold question in evaluating the prison's obligation to accommodate a request would still be whether the inmate's dietary request arose out of sincerely held beliefs that were religious in nature.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4b29297a-7223-4dae-a9fc-a294677b62b3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://archive.adl.org/civil_rights/prison_ex.asp", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9501674175262451, "token_count": 2202, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "SIR,—As, a regular reader for nearly five years, I must congratulate you on your far-sighted leading asticle of May I. It came to me as a breeze of sanity, courage and hope after the heavy and almost stifling hothouse atmosphere created, alas, by the endless medieval platitudes about the \" guild system,\" the \" abolition of usury,\" the \" just price \" (whatever that may mean to-day), and all the stock-intrade of the doctrinaire Catholic writers on socio-economic questions.\nExcept for one or two passages that indicate some understanding of the technical approach to the central problem of industrial reconstruction, I fear that even Mr. Stanley James lucid series of articles strike one as hut an honest yet unconvincing attempt to put \" old wine into new bottles.\" To anyone familiar with the machinery of industrial administration, and its possibilities as an instrument of self-government in modern industry as a whole, neither Mr. James nor Mr. Benvenisti (with his over-insistence on the financial problem), nor the really \" Long \" answer to \" What is the Social Policy of the Catholic Church?\" given in 3 recent issue, give any indication as to how the vital problem of reconstruct' ins our industrial politico-economic system is to be tackled as a post-war fact.\nI am therefore more than glad to see that you yourself arc aware that planning has come to stay ; and that you for one realise that a planned economy is \" the obvious and inevitable solution to the social problems of the day.\" To my knowledge you are the first Catholic writer to accept this situation fearlessly and to acknowledge it as a necessary historical fact of social evolution. Since returning from the forty-fifth Oxford Management Conference I have been more than ever appalled by the guff which needlessly separates the usual run of academic Catholic thought on this subject from the eminently practical Christian thinking (of which your leading article is a grand example) of those directly concerned with the relations between employer and employee.\nHow many Catholic writers have ever seriously considered the implications of Works Councils or of Joint Production Committees? Have they ever contributed one particle of constructive thought to the basis and functioning of these instruments of co-operation as between employers and workers on the things that really matter to-day? In fact I often wonder whether Catholics are really alive to social problems. Of the 200 or so managers and managing directors of industrial concerns, ranging from the huge combine like I.C.I. to the small family-owned business, who were present at the Oxford Conference there was not one who was a Catholic.\nNow surely there are some Catholics represented in management circles in this country? If so, it was their duty to attend a conference of this nature, devoted as it was to the general theme of \" co-operation between employers and labour,\" in order that the Catholic viewpoint could be expressed. Believe me, there were opportunities galore. For example, at one of the early sessions of the conference, the chairman, a delightful, popular and typically agnostic personality, voiced his scepticism as to whether \" industry has within itself the spiritual power to create cooperation.\" Please note that even he recognised it as a spiritual problem.\nHis view was, however, that \" what industry needed now was a great leader, like Mr. Churchill after Dunkirk.\" (Shades of Main!) On the other hand, the chairman at a subsequent session, when Jack Tanner gave us the trade union point of view on industrial cooperation and the planned society of the future, emphasised that this spiritual problem could he solved by the delegates present if they would only make up their minds to put their backs into solving it. Far from confessing a disbelief in any of the great religions as a source of industrial inspiration (as the other chairman did to me privately afterwards), he spoke as a practical Christian and laid grim stress on the spiritual values underlying all human nature.\nThe point I am getting at. is this. Here were gathered together a body of industrial administrators representative of all manners and sizes of manufacturing and distributive organisations, all of whom were in agreement with Tanner that the problem they had come to discuss was,a human one—not merely one of industrial organisation as such. As a result they discussed things not in any doctrinaire fashion, but with a practical grasp coupled with vision that was impressive, to say the least. I must confess that I left Oxford feeling that this vital social problem can be left safely in the capable, sympathetic and really experienced hands of industrial management—which, after all, lies midway between shareholder and worker.\nAll of us at the Conference felt the urgency of this problem. As Sir Frederielt Leggett, the Government's Chief Industrial Commissioner, put it (amplified by a wealth of sober and convincing argument): \" Unless we solve this problem of industrial cooperation now, during the war, we shall be faced with a workers' revolution at the end of it.\" Sir Frederick made it painfully clear, moreover, that although the Government was quite neutral in the matter of co-operative machinery and its erection, yet its sympathies lay with the worker rather than with the employer.\nIt seems to me that Catholics as a whole are doing little to further the cause of true industrial democracy, either in their writings or their actions. Why should the impetus for the creation of Joint Production Committees have been left to the Communist Party?, Why could it not have come/from the ,Y.C.W. or the S.O.S. movement? How many Catholics, I wonder, could have written such a revolutionary and far-reaching article as that of Samuel Courtauld in the April issue of the Economic Journal? This great capitalist and industrialist evidently moves with the times. No doubt he has been \"converted\" by his former personnel manager, Dr. Marsden Jones, now Director of Factories under the Ministry of Supply, and one of the pioneers in the field of practical industrial so-operation. Would that there were one or two Catholics of his calibre in industry to-day!\n88. Napier Court, Hurlingham, S.W.6.\n[We think our correspondent underestimates the importance from the Christian point of view of the general framework within which practical cooperation should proceed. It is possible to make useful progress in tackling detailed problems, and yet wake up to find that the whole system has been allowed to drift into a totalitarianism. That is why the insistence on a Guild ideal, no atelier how much modified to suit present needs, remains important.— EDITOR, C.H.1", "id": "<urn:uuid:6a509af1-54bf-452c-a3cf-a908e3450ef8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/29th-may-1942/2/catholics-and-a-new-order", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9711897373199463, "token_count": 1346, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Michigan could end 'spoiled' elections with instant runoff voting\nBy Douglas Campbell\nPublished November 14th 2006 in The Detroit News\n'Tis November. Leaves are falling, Lucy snatched the football away from Charlie Brown, and Democrats are whining that the Green Party spoiled an election.\nIn the election for the Michigan Senate, Republican John Pappageorge, Democrat Andy Levin and Green Kyle McBee each received a minority of the vote in District 13, which covers part of Oakland County. Pappageorge received a plurality -- more votes than anybody else -- and will be the district's senator. Democrats say that because Levin and McBee, combined, received more votes than Pappageorge, Levin should get the Senate seat.\nI understand their disappointment, after spending close to a $1 million campaigning for this one Senate seat, including $364,600 of soft money from the Senate Democratic Fund, a similar amount from political action committees and much of the remainder from lawyers and chief executives (for a job that pays $79,650 a year).\nMinority votes don't win\nCorrect me if I'm clueless here: Which part of receiving a minority of the vote entitles you to expect to win? Some are howling that the election was \"spoiled\" because \"the left\" was divided between Democrats and Greens, and \"the right\" won the Senate seat.\nI don't see it as spoiled so much as the inevitable outcome of our first-past-the-post style of elections. Somebody wins, everybody else loses. If you earn a minority of the vote, you should expect to lose.\nOur system doesn't allocate 3 percent of the seats in Congress to parties that receive 3 percent of the vote, or there would be three Green senators and 13 Green representatives in Washington, D.C.\nMcBee accepted no soft money, corporate contributions or PAC money. It's the Green Party way - we have unilaterally implemented campaign finance reform and remain 100-percent lobbyist-free. Almost everyone wants to see obscene sums of money out of political campaigning and we have formed a new political party that does precisely that.\nBut because McBee spent less than 1 percent of what Levin did advertising in media outlets, he encountered a near-perfect news blackout from those media outlets.\nGreen's campaign reforms\nYes, the Green Party has a plan for campaign finance reform. We may be best known for protecting and restoring the natural environment, but becoming active in politics is necessary to achieve that. Wangari Maathai, recipient of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize and the founder of the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, probably says it best:\n\"It is very, very important for the world to recognize the linkage between good management of the environment, sustainable and efficient management of our environment and resources, and equitable distribution of these resources on one side, and democratic space and peace. If we are going to manage our resources sustainability, efficiently, if we are going to share them equitably, we need democratic space. It is impossible to manage resources responsibly and sustainably in a dictatorship, because in such a situation you have a few people controlling the resources at the expense of the many, and therefore, you cannot have peace. Sooner or later, you have conflict.\"\nTry new voting system\nThe United States may not be a dictatorship, but we do have a few people controlling the resources at the expense of the many.\nWe have a plan for eliminating spoiled elections, too: Instant Runoff Voting, which we've been promoting since day one. Under this system, you mark both your first and second choices. It makes it unnecessary to choose the lesser of two weasels, enables you to mark both your true preference and your fallback choice, mathematically eliminates the possibility of spoiled elections, eliminates the need for primary elections and assures no candidate is elected without a majority.\nWe just haven't found anybody in the Legislature who's interested in preventing spoiled elections.\nThe Green party is not going away, and we're not giving up.

{"text": "Erica first noticed him when they were five.\nStiles was the rowdy little five-year-old, always bouncing from one foot to the other, he was the one who brought an extra pack of crayons in case anyone forgot theirs, who would hug their teacher's legs before leaving everyday after school--and Erica knew this, because the only father who came after Stiles' to pick their kid up was her own. He was the one to split a sandwich that was already split in half in case any of the other child mentioned they were hungry and didn't have enough money for lunch. He was nice, and he may have been a little restless, but not in the way most boys were at that age. He was different.\nSomething most kids weren't.\nHe had been great, and Erica had immediately been captivated by him.\nThey'd never talked, not really, not because Erica was scared he'd give her cooties but because she was scared of rejection. Stiles didn't seem like a jerk, but Erica was only five and the thought of someone cooler than her not wanting to be her friend hurt more than the (admittedly low) possibility of him saying yes ever happening could make her happy. So she stayed away, admired from afar.\nShe'd stay like that for years.\nShe didn't mind, though, because Stiles made her happy just because he was happy.\nThe summer she turned twelve is when the seizures started happening.\nShe started to miss school more, sat in the back of the classroom when she actually went instead of sitting in the front like she used to, would sink back so she'd go unnoticed. It's not that Erica wanted it to be this way, she wanted to go out with friends and experiment with boys and be that girl that every boy wanted--the girl that Stiles wanted, but she couldn't do that when she was the poster child of a liability. She could never go out with boys, because what if she had a seizure while they were at the movies holding hands? Or worse--when they were kissing. She was already mortified enough that she had the condition, she didn't want it to relfect on her worse than it already did.\nSo, she stayed away from boys, told herself that she was saving herself the embarrassment, and them the realization that their date was a total loser. Maybe they'd find their own little personal Lydia Martin--she'd be better for them. Boys didn't want someone like Erica, someone who was sickly and weak, a girl that was so terrifed of what her condition was capable of that she could barely control herself enough not to cry in class. They needed someone like Lydia. Someone who was brave, brilliant, and beautiful.\nNo one would ever notice Erica. She wasn't a Lydia. She'd never be a Lydia.\nAnd sure, Stiles was understanding, he was too nice for his own good and had grown up with a father figure that had taught him right from wrong--explicitly--and he'd grown up as a pretty accepting person, too, but Erica didn't think Stiles would be friends with that-girl-who-seizes-because-she-has-a-disease-or-something. She wasn't so sure that his nice-guy-streak would extend as far as that.\nStiles didn't have to accept it. He didn't have to accept Erica or her condition or anything about her, really. Erica was nothing to him, had always been nothing to him--hell, Erica had never even been sure that he'd ever noticed her, let alone wanted anything to do with her.\nThe most embarrassing thing about it, though, was that she always went to Mrs. Riley in the clinic to take her medication so she wouldn't have seizures in class, and she knew that it shouldn’t be something she should be ashamed of, because it was keeping her alive and that was the best thing, for her, and for her family. But it made her feel different from other kids. It made her feel like an outsider.\nErica didn’t need another reason to be an outsider; she’d already had enough.\nBut then Stiles started coming a few months later, after his mom died.\n\"You're Erica, right?\" He asked, one afternoon when Mrs. Riley was in the other room tending to a sick kid, with some sort of flu. Erica was forced to stay in a different room, almost always, because she had a shitty immune system.\nNot that she wanted to see puke or anything, but it just felt like one more kick in the direction of invisibility. She was only twelve, and everything was melodramatic and the world was always ending, but it didn't make things easier, or better, or any of the things that her doctors and her parents had promised her.\nIt just made it more difficult, made kids stare at her in the halls and whisper about her, made some kids push her into lockers and call her Epileptic Erica, Never-Get-a-Date Erica, Earthquake-Make-the-Ground-Shake Erica--really, she’d heard them all.\nKids were assholes, but Erica eventually had just understood that it was who she was.\nBut anyway, her heart got caught in her throat and her fingers started to get clammy, kind of\nhow she sometimes felt before she had a seizure, and she almost was afraid she was about to have one before she realized it was just Stiles . Stiles made her crazy inside, made her think about things that a twelve-year-old girl shouldn't be thinking about, like first kisses and the 7th grade dance coming up, and how Stiles had always looked ridiculously good in red.\n\"Yeah,\" She whispered, voice cracking, but Stiles didn't seem to notice, and if he did--which he probably did, because sometimes Erica was convinced that Stiles noticed everything, except for her, never did he notice her--he was nice enough not to say anything--\nStiles was just--nice. Too nice, almost.\nStiles was bouncing his leg up and down, a habit that Erica knew he got when he was too tired of sitting in one place for too long, and it should've been annoying, but it was Stiles so she just found it adorable.\n\"Nice to meet you,\" he said, and then kind of flushed, like he was embarrassed about something. Probably that he was talking to her, Erica thought. \"I'm Stiles. I don't think--I've ever introduced myself to you. Sorry, about that. I wasn't--avoiding you, or anything, I just don't know what to say. I'm bad with words,\" he blabbered.\nErica bit her lip on a smile. \"That's okay. No one ever does.\"\nStiles kind of looked conflicted at that, hurt in a way that she'd never seen before, but she shrugged it off--mentally, of course, because Stiles already thought she was crazy, probably, he didn't need another reason.\nHe looked like he was about to say something, but then Mrs. Riley walked in with both of their medication bottles in hand, and handed them both theirs respectively, along with some water.\n\"Come back before the day's end, Erica, we have to talk about the new medication your doctor's putting you on,\" Mrs. Riley said, because she obviously wanted to ruin Erica's life forever .\n\"Okay,\" she answered, quietly, glancing over at Stiles, who was smiling at her slightly.\n\"That's annoying, isn't it? My doctor's always changing my ADD medication on me too.\" He grabbed his backpack after swallowing his pills, strapping it over both shoulders before waving at her slightly. \"See you around, Erica. It was nice to meet you!\"\nEveryday after that, she'd find a piece of notebook paper on her desk in Mr. Greene's class, a simple piece of notebook paper, folded and tattered around the edges like it'd been folded over and over again.\nIt was a simple piece of notebook paper and it'd always have a \"Have a great day, Erica :-) - G.\"\nShe treausred them so much she eventually had to get a box for them, had stuck them under her bed and even though they were always the same, when she was feeling especially shitty on the worst nights, she'd stay up for hours to read them all, because someone actually cared.\nAnd for Erica, that meant everything.\nTwo days into sophomore year, the letters stopped.\nTwo days into sophomore year, Stiles started to skip classes more, his grades started to slip a little, and he was perpetually sweaty.\nFour days into sophomore year, Erica realized that the letters were done for good.\nSix days into sophomore year, Erica had a seizure in class for the first time in months.\nThen Derek happened, Derek happened and he promised he’d make everything better for her, that he’d make the seizures stop and he’d make everything change and the one thing in life that Erica had ever wanted was change.\nErica wanted to stop feeling helpless and useless. She wanted to stop being the laughing stock of the school. She wanted to stop being second to Lydia Martin, she wanted to be noticed, by Stiles, by everyone.\nErica wanted what Derek could give her, and even if she wasn’t completely sure that Derek was telling the truth, she bared her throat and whispered, “yes.”\nThe morning after the bite, Erica knew the seizures wouldn’t return.\nShe felt strong in a way that she never had, strong and powerful and different.\nDerek was there, lurking in the corner of her hospital room, and she almost screamed at him, asking what he was doing here, but she didn’t, she sank back to the sheets, before looking up at him curiously.\n“What am I now?” She whispered.\nHe grinned, feral and promising, eyes flashing red. “You’re a werewolf.”\nShe almost laughed at the absurdity of it, because werewolves were the nightmares you told your stupid kid brother at night so he wouldn’t be able to sleep, they weren’t real, they were fantasy. But Erica knew Derek wasn’t lying, and it should’ve made her terrified, to think that she was the monster she used to be afraid of when she was younger, what all kids were afraid of, but it only made her swell up, with something that resembled pride.\nAnd maybe a little fear.\nBut mostly pride.\n“Will I kill anyone?” She asked.\nShe didn’t want to kill anyone.\n“No,” Derek answered, more of a snort than anything, and made the move to leave.\n“But you could,” he paused at the door, glancing at her over his shoulder, before leaving.\nShe won’t kill anyone.\nBut she could.\nIt made her feel more safe than she’d ever felt in years.\n“I need you to distract him.”\nErica rose an eyebrow in Derek’s general direction. “Pardon?”\nDerek growled, eyes flashing red, and a part of her wanted to turn belly-down on the floor. She didn't, of course, but she wanted to. “I need you to distract Stiles for a while.”\nHer heart thudded in her chest, and by the look that Derek gave her, she knew that Derek had heard it--of course he’d heard it, he heard everything, he heard how Erica had spent the first few nights in her room, hissing and shaking out on the bed, clawing at the sheets, not because she had any reason to, but because she could. Because she had control, something she hadn't had since it was ripped away from her when she was twelve, lying on the hospital bed sweating through sheets after sheets.\nDerek shrugged. “You need to hold him off and point him in a different direction. Tie him to a chair. Lock him in a closet. Just make sure he doesn’t get to that ice rink tonight.”\n“Okay,” She whispered, because she was still young, she still hadn’t realized that she’d have enough room to wiggle around with Derek, that she could poke at him and prod him and anger him without any serious repercussions.\nWhen Derek found out she wrecked Stiles’ car and knocked him out, Derek had shoved her up against a wall and had told her that taking initiative was careless and stupid and that she shouldn’t rough up a human, much less the sheriff’s son.\nShe’d pushed back, had stared at him with glowing eyes, and hissed, “you wouldn’t understand,” because he didn’t, and he never would.\nErica didn’t mean to hurt Stiles.\nShe didn’t mean to hurt him at all.\nDerek gave her protection, Derek gave her strength. Derek gave her pride and happiness and things she’d never experienced before--well, things she hadn’t experienced in a long time. So yeah, Erica may have kissed him, may have used it more as a tactic to throw him off, but she’d kissed him, with enough confidence to know that there’d been a 90% chance he’d kiss her back. It was reckless and would probably end in nothing but a pissed off Alpha and her leaving with her tail in between her legs, but Erica--\nShe wanted control, now. She wanted to stop taking orders and she wanted to shout them.\nShe wanted it and Derek was the one that she could milk it out of, at least for a couple of seconds.\nAnd it wasn’t like Erica was stupid, she wasn’t unaware, she knew how attractive she was now.\nAnd Derek had never told her, had never told her or Isaac or Boyd, but Erica knew--\nShe knew Derek had a type, and she was achingly certain blondes were included.\n(She was right; even if it only lasted a few seconds, she was right.)\nThe day in the hallway, when Stiles had cornered her to ask about Jackson’s parents, she couldn’t hide her attraction anymore.\nShe couldn’t hide how she had spent years yearning for his affection and attention without ever getting it. She couldn’t hide that because maybe she thought that there was a chance that Stiles would want it. She couldn’t pick up scents like Derek or Scott could, because Derek hadn’t taught them that, had barely taught them anything besides basic combat skills, but she could see Stiles’ mouth open in surprise whenever she came around, like he still wasn’t used to how she looked now.\nHow she would’ve looked if she had never had epilepsy.\n“I used to have the worst crush in the world on you ,” Erica says, voice cracking like it hadn’t since before she’d been turned. Stiles had simply blinked at her, like he didn’t believe her. “Yes, you, Stiles.”\nAnd for a moment, for a moment she let herself believe that she’d gotten through to him, that he had seen her for her , for what she’d been trying to to show him all along.\n“And you never noticed me,” Erica laughed, after Stiles made no move to say anything, but it was humorless, falling dry in her throat. “Like how you’re not noticing me now.”\nAfter Jackson attacked her, when they brought her to Derek, Erica focused on how Stiles’ heart was beating like a hummingbird’s in his chest, how Erica might even be inclined to call it out of fear, fear for her safety, for her life .\nShe’d finally gotten his attention.\nAnd it was because she was dying .\n“Is she dying?” Stiles asked, sounding panicked and on-edge and Erica would’ve smiled if she could have.\nBecause he cared.\nHe showed something for her.\nHe didn’t want her to die.\n“Stiles, you'd make a good batman,” she said, reaching up with a hand to grasp his flannel shirt sleeve.\nShe didn’t have to look to notice Derek’s glare.\nShe didn’t have to have a superior senses to smell how angry Derek was.\nShe didn’t know how she knew, but in that moment, she knew Stiles would never be hers.\nHe already belonged to someone else.\nEighty-three days into sophomore year, she found a letter on her desk, again.\n\"Batman always needs some backup. - G\"\nErica, despite herself, smiled.", "id": "<urn:uuid:062c3496-aec6-4845-a1b3-42e8db05134d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://archiveofourown.org/works/456027", "date": "2013-05-18T08:03:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.992565393447876, "token_count": 3635, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "ACLU fights residency law for hiring\nA lawsuit says the state should not limit employees to current or former residents\nA law that requires applicants for most public-sector jobs to be current or former Hawaii residents at the time of application is adversely affecting both non-residents seeking employment and the state government, a civil rights group contends.\n\"Damage from the pre-employment residency requirement runs not just to plaintiffs ... but also to the public interest of Hawaii's residents because (agencies) are unable to fill positions that are necessary for a well-equipped government,\" the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii said in a court motion filed yesterday. The motion seeks a preliminary injunction to stop enforcement of the residency requirements until the issue can be decided by the courts.\nIn July the ACLU sued the state and the City and County of Honolulu on behalf of two Florida men who said their applications for various state and county jobs were rejected solely because of the residency requirements. The federal lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, contends the residency requirements are unconstitutional and penalize nonresidents.\nAttorney General Mark Bennett has said he believes the state law, upon which county hiring policies are based, is constitutional and that he will defend it, but he acknowledges the issue is an \"open question\" that never has been definitively decided by the courts.\nCity officials have declined comment on the lawsuit.\nThe ACLU contends plaintiffs Blane M. Wilson of Pensacola and Kevin R. Walsh of Tallahassee have suffered irreparable harm, not being able to apply for work in Hawaii.

Catholic has received more and more offers to add to his list that has now exceeded twenty; with USC and Clemson among his most recent offers.\nAnother program that liked what they saw in the No. 18 overall prospect in the country was the Oklahoma Sooners who offered as well a little over a week ago.\nThe majority of the 2012 class that the Sooners signed haven't even stepped foot on campus but that doesn't mean they aren't already recruiting for the Crimson and Cream. The thing is the Sooner signee that's been talking with Isaac plays the same position as the Joliet Catholic product.\n\"Obviously they are winners, they have won a lot. I've talked to one of their running backs that they got for 2012, David Smith. Obviously we are from the same general area. He said it was pretty nice out there and to definitely check it out. I take his word, if I can I can,\" Isaac said.\nOklahoma's running backs coach, Cale Gundy is responsible for recruiting Isaac. Though they have not met in person Isaac says Gundy has made a good first impression.\n\"He's been real straight up about everything. He seems like a good guy. Obviously meeting someone in person is what you want to do but good first impression for sure,\" he said.\nAcademically Isaac is doing well with a 3.1 GPA and says he has not taken the SAT yet. Last season on the gridiron Isaac had a monster year finishing with 203 carries for 2629 yards, and 51 touchdowns.\nBeing as big and fast as Isaac is and playing running back some might say he has an advantage at the high school level. That may be true but Isaac hasn't allowed himself to think his size and speed alone will get the job done, which is especially true when at the next level.\n\"Obviously I have some weight behind me to do some things. When we are playing the game I'm not thinking I've got to play like a big back, I know something that I have really tried to get myself to do is get low especially when you are playing in crowded areas is get low,\" he said. \"So, it wouldn't necessarily be like oh he's running straight up you know I get down low, get behind my pads and just run hard and do whatever is necessary to get wherever I need to.\"\nWith all the prestigious programs that have offered Isaac the talented running back is aware that each will have impressive facilities on their campus but he is looking for more than that.\n\"At this point all these big programs have all got great facilities, and good things about them. Definitely, the people will set apart a school and just a general feel when on campus.\"\nIsaac says he would like to play in a pro-style offense at the next level.\nArizona State NEWS", "id": "<urn:uuid:4831f6e2-a4f0-4898-8563-c1b0f08101c8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://arizonastate.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1339165", "date": "2013-05-18T05:31:47Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9851552844047546, "token_count": 666, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

(The full list of those products is listed in the Official Rules.) The announcement states:\n“This contest, launched in 2007, is a way for promising start-ups to get noticed and compete for an opportunity to win some great rewards for your start-up. This year’s challenge offers prizes such as $100K in combined cash and credits for multiple winners, VC introductions, PR support, and more. If your start-up is built using AWS, we want you to apply!”\nThe write up goes on to give some specifics on the rewards Amazon will shower upon the winning contestant. You can see the entire list here, but opportunity and publicity are perhaps the most promising. The announcement mentions:\n“Meet Tier One Investors: At last year’s event, finalists met 1:1 with representatives from top VCs such as Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, NEA, Accel and Madrona Venture Group. Last year’s winner Fantasy Shopper went on to raise $3.3M from top tier venture firms NEA and Accel after the Challenge.\n“Press and attention for your start-up: Finalists and Semi-Finalists will be featured in Start-Up Challenge press releases which have previously been picked up by top tech outlets such as TechCrunch and GigaOM.”\nSo, there you have it.

E de fato, era assim:\nParticle physics is a branch of physics that studies the elementary particle|elementary subatomic constituents of matter and radiation, and their interactions. The field is also called high energy physics, because many elementary particles do not occur under ambient conditions on Earth. They can only be created artificially during high energy collisions with other particles in particle accelerators.\nParticle physics has evolved out of its parent field of nuclear physics and is typically still taught in close association with it. Scientific research in this area has produced a long list of particles.\nMas hein? Partículas que só podem ser criadas em aceleradores? Física de partículas é ensinada junto com física nuclear? A pesquisa produz partículas (essa é ótima!)?\nEm que mundo essa pessoa vive? Reescrevi:\nParticle Physics is a branch of physics that studies the existence and interactions of particles, which are the constituents of what is usually referred as matter or radiation. In our current understanding, particles are excitations of quantum fields and interact following their dynamics. Most of the interest in this area is in fundamental fields, those that cannot be described as a bound state of other fields.

{"text": "- published: 19 Mar 2013\n- views: 42\n- author: T.A. B\npossibly testing on weans, that worries me http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21849808.\nA vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and \"remember\" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated; see cancer vaccine).\nThe term vaccine derives from Edward Jenner's 1796 use of cow pox (Latin variola vaccinia, adapted from the Latin vaccīn-us, from vacca, cow), to inoculate humans, providing them protection against smallpox.\nVaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease. Sometimes, this is because the host's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all. This may be due to a lowered immunity in general (diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection, age) or because the host's immune system does not have a B cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen.\nEven if the host develops antibodies, the human immune system is not perfect and in any case the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection immediately. In this case, the infection will be less severe and heal faster.\nAdjuvants are typically used to boost immune response. Most often aluminium adjuvants are used, but adjuvants like squalene are also used in some vaccines and more vaccines with squalene and phosphate adjuvants are being tested. Larger doses are used in some cases for older people (50–75 years and up), whose immune response to a given vaccine is not as strong.\nThe efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on a number of factors:\nWhen a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against, the disease is likely to be milder than without vaccination.\nThe following are important considerations in the effectiveness of a vaccination program:\nIn 1958 there were 763,094 cases of measles and 552 deaths in the United States. With the help of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56). In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. 54 out of 64 infections were associated with importation from another country, although only 13% were actually acquired outside of the United States; 63 of these 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles, or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.\nVaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them.\nThere are several types of vaccines in use. These represent different strategies used to try to reduce risk of illness, while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response.\nSome vaccines contain killed, but previously virulent, micro-organisms that have been destroyed with chemicals, heat, radioactivity or antibiotics. Examples are the influenza vaccine, cholera vaccine, bubonic plague vaccine, polio vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, and rabies vaccine.\nSome vaccines contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many of these are live viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or which use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps and the bacterial disease typhoid. The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a contagious strain, but contains a virulently modified strain called \"BCG\" used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain Yersinia pestis EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They have the capacity of transient growth so they give prolonged protection, and no booster dose is required. But they may get reverted to the virulent form and cause the disease.\nToxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. Toxoid vaccines are known for their efficacy. Not all toxoids are for micro-organisms; for example, Crotalus atrox toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites.\nProtein subunit – rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated micro-organism to an immune system (which would constitute a \"whole-agent\" vaccine), a fragment of it can create an immune response. Examples include the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients, but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast), the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) that is composed of the viral major capsid protein, and the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus. Subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization.\nConjugate – certain bacteria have polysaccharide outer coats that are poorly immunogenic. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g. toxins), the immune system can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen. This approach is used in the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine.\nA number of innovative vaccines are also in development and in use:\nWhile most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from micro-organisms, synthetic vaccines are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates or antigens.\nVaccines may be monovalent (also called univalent) or multivalent (also called polyvalent). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism. A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms. In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.\nThe immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the virulent version of an agent comes along the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) by recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.\nWhen two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin polio vaccine, where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the \"take\" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine. This phenomenon has also been found to be a problem with the dengue vaccines currently being researched,[when?] where the DEN-3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN-1, -2 and -4 serotypes.\nVaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases known to man. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of four countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan). The difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings, however, have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.\nIn order to provide best protection, children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional \"booster\" shots often required to achieve \"full immunity\". This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia. The large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.\nBesides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters, many specific vaccines are recommended at other ages or for repeated injections throughout life—most commonly for measles, tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia. Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended in the U.S. (as of 2011) and UK (as of 2009). Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza, which are more deadly to that group. In 2006, a vaccine was introduced against shingles, a disease caused by the chickenpox virus, which usually affects the elderly.\nSometime during the 1770s Edward Jenner heard a milkmaid boast that she would never have the often-fatal or disfiguring disease smallpox, because she had already had cowpox, which has a very mild effect in humans. In 1796, Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, inoculated an 8-year-old boy with it, and six weeks later variolated the boy's arm with smallpox, afterwards observing that the boy did not catch smallpox. Further experimentation demonstrated the efficacy of the procedure on an infant. Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation, the latter, though still widely practiced in England, was banned in 1840. Louis Pasteur generalized Jenner's idea by developing what he called a rabies vaccine, and in the nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.\nThe twentieth century saw the introduction of several successful vaccines, including those against diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s. Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century. As vaccines became more common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including malaria and HIV.\n||The neutrality of this section is disputed. Please see the discussion on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved. (October 2011)|\n||This article is missing information about Scientific rebuttal to the attacks. This concern has been noted on the talk page where whether or not to include such information may be discussed. (October 2011)|\nOpposition to vaccination, from a wide array of vaccine critics, has existed since the earliest vaccination campaigns. Although the benefits of preventing suffering and death from serious infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following immunization, disputes have arisen over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, and safety of vaccination. Some vaccination critics say that vaccines are ineffective against disease or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate. Some religious groups do not allow vaccination, and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty. In response, concern has been raised that spreading unfounded information about the medical risks of vaccines increases rates of life-threatening infections, not only in the children whose parents refused vaccinations, but also in other children, perhaps too young for vaccines, who could contract infections from unvaccinated carriers (see herd immunity).\nOne challenge in vaccine development is economic: many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases, because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.\nMost vaccine development to date has relied on \"push\" funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations. Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health. The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades.[when?] This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support, rather than economic incentive.\nThe filing of patents on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines. Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product, the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used on the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy.\nVaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza), or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Alternatively, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.\nVaccine production techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.\nIn 2010, India produced 60 percent of world's vaccine worth about $900 million.\nMany vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection that, in one 1928 incident, killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Several preservatives are available, including thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, has better shelf life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety, but in the U.S., the European Union, and a few other affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content. Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims.\nThere are several new delivery systems in development[when?] that will hopefully make vaccines more efficient to deliver. Possible methods include liposomes and ISCOM (immune stimulating complex).\nThe latest developments[when?] in vaccine delivery technologies have resulted in oral vaccines. A polio vaccine was developed and tested by volunteer vaccinations with no formal training; the results were positive in that the ease of the vaccines increased. With an oral vaccine, there is no risk of blood contamination. Oral vaccines are likely to be solid which have proven to be more stable and less likely to freeze; this stability reduces the need for a \"cold chain\": the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines. A microneedle approach, which is still in stages of development, uses \"pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin\".\nA nanopatch is a needle free vaccine delivery system which is under development. A stamp-sized patch similar to an adhesive bandage contains about 20,000 microscopic projections per square inch. When worn on the skin, it will deliver vaccine directly to the skin, which has a higher concentration of immune cells than that in the muscles, where needles and syringes deliver. It thus increases the effectiveness of the vaccination using a lower amount of vaccine used in traditional syringe delivery system.\nThe use of plasmids has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.\nVaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans. Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated. In some instances, wild populations may be vaccinated. This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine-laced food spread in a disease-prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons.\nWhere rabies occurs, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease among others.\nVaccine development has several trends:\nPrinciples that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure. Factors that have impact on the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine, demographics, regulatory science, political, cultural, and social responses.\n|Modern Vaccine and Adjuvant Production and Characterization, Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News|\nThe World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy.

{"text": "WASHINGTON -- As the House begins to debate a major overhaul of the campaign finance system, special-interest groups are opening the floodgates and spending big money to try to preserve their right to spend big money on campaigns.\nFrom the National Right to Life Committee to the American Civil Liberties Union to huge corporations, Capitol Hill has been blitzed by phone calls, letters, advertisements and faxes arguing that the legislation would infringe on their right to express political opinions.\n\"We're open, and we're loud, and we're very clear how we feel about this,\" said Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. \"What's at stake is what type of political society we live under in the 21st century -- whether we live in a society where men and women can get together and express a point of view or whether we're going to turn over the keys to the national media conglomerates.\"\nRelenting to pressure from more than 200 members who signed a petition supporting campaign finance legislation, House Republican leaders will bring to the House floor tomorrow up to 16 campaign finance bills.\nThe debate will turn on the two most prominent bills, both of which are designed to curtail \"soft money,\" the unregulated and unlimited contributions to political parties from unions, corporations and wealthy individuals.\nThe tougher of the two bills, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, and Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, would ban soft money to both state and national parties. The other bill, sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of first-term representatives, would restrict donations only to national party organizations; soft money could still go to state parties, which could then funnel the money to federal candidates.\nThe Shays-Meehan bill, identical to a Senate version sponsored by John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, would also ban political ads paid for by independent interest groups in the last 60 days of a campaign, if the ad mentioned a candidate by name. Groups that paid for such ads would have to disclose their donors.\n\"It's not a matter of their voices being denied,\" Shays said. \"It's a matter of disclosure. The truth is, right now, they can say outrageous things about anybody, and they have no accountability.\"\nA final vote will likely come in June. In the Senate, Republican leaders have said resolutely that they do not plan to revisit the campaign finance issue this year.\nHouse Republican leaders have also made clear that they will oppose new limits on campaign donations, making passage a long shot. The way they have structured the debate also presents a significant new hurdle. Members can split their votes among any number of competing versions, allowing them all to fail for lack of a majority, and still claim they supported reform. Even Shays concedes that fewer than half the House members back real reform.\nOpponents of the bills are as united as ever. The Christian Coalition, for example, has made campaign finance reform one of its \"key issues.\" It has listed a candidate's position on campaign reform on the coalition's congressional score cards, which are stuffed into church pews and sent to nearly 2 million people.\n\"What's going on here is first and foremost an attack on the First Amendment free-speech rights of people to organize into interest groups and express themselves,\" said Arne Owens, a Christian Coalition spokesman.\nThe National Association of Broadcasters has written to every member of Congress and mobilized its member companies to oppose any free or reduced-rate air time for candidates. That proposal, which some lawmakers plan to introduce as an amendment, is intended to lower the cost of campaigns and make aggressive fund-raising less necessary.\nThe National Association of Business Political Action Committees has asked the 20 million Americans who donate to PACs to write or call their representatives. The group also plans to launch an advertising campaign this week opposing reform bills.\n\"We're spending money to protect the right of 20 million Americans to participate in the political process in the way they choose,\" said Steve Stockmeyer, the group's chief lobbyist.\nAnd the National Rifle Association is rustling up its considerable grass roots, denouncing reform bills on radio talk shows and sending lobbyists to Capitol Hill.\nYet even as they fight to preserve the campaign finance system, some donors are quietly growing tired of a process that is extracting more and more of their money to finance political campaigns. General Motors, Monsanto, AlliedSignal and Tenneco have halted donations of soft money. Charles S. Mack, president of the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, said other companies are exploring the option. If the trend catches on, the groundswell may do more to change the political system than any legislation out of Washington.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a17606ca-cad2-4b84-9179-bc6775488413>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-05-20/news/1998140068_1_campaign-finance-soft-money-house-republican-leaders", "date": "2013-05-18T06:47:09Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.96440190076828, "token_count": 966, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Wars have given us the Jeep, the computer and even the microwave.\nWill the war in Iraq give us the Tiger?\nMilitary scientists at Edgewood Chemical Biological Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground hope so. The machine - its full name is the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery - combines a chute, an engine, chemical tanks and other components, giving it the appearance of a lunar rover. It's designed to turn food and waste into fuel. If it works, it could save scores of American and Iraqi lives.\nAmong the biggest threats that soldiers face in the war in Iraq are the roadside bombs that have killed or maimed thousands since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Because some military bases lack a landfill, transporting garbage to dumps miles away in the desert has become a potentially fatal routine for U.S. troops and military contractors.\nThe Tiger would attempt to solve two problems at once: It would sharply reduce those trash hauls and provide the military with an alternative source of fuel.\nIt is the latest in a long line of wartime innovations, from can openers to desert boots. The conflict in Iraq has produced innovations such as \"warlocks,\" which jam electronic signals from cell phones, garage door openers and other electronic devices that insurgents use to detonate roadside bombs, according to Inventors Digest.\n\"In wartime, you're not worried about making a profit necessarily. You're worried about getting the latest technology on the street,\" said Peter Kindsvatter, a military historian at Aberdeen Proving Ground, who added that money is spent more freely for research when a nation is at war. \"Basically, you find yourself in a technology race with your enemy.\"\nThe Tiger, now being tested in Baghdad, would not be the first device to turn garbage into energy - a large incinerator near Baltimore's downtown stadiums does it. But it would be among the first to attempt to do it on a small scale. Its creators say it could one day become widely used in civilian life, following the lead of other wartime innovations.\nDuring World War II, contractors developed the Jeep to meet the military's desire for a light, all-purpose vehicle that could transport supplies.\nThe development of radar technology to spot Nazi planes led to the microwave, according to historians.\nThe World War II era also gave birth to the first electronic digital computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC. Funded by the Defense Department, the machine was built to compute ballistics tables that soldiers used to mechanically aim large guns. For years it was located at Aberdeen Proving Ground.\nThis decade, the Pentagon determined that garbage on military bases poses a serious logistical problem.\n\"When you're over in a combat area and people are shooting at you, you still have to deal with your trash,\" said John Spiller, project officer with the Army's Rapid Equipping Force, which is funding the Tiger project. \"How would you feel if somebody was shooting at you every other time you pushed it down the curb?\"\nHe and other Army officials said they could not recall any specific attacks against troops or contractors heading to dumpsites.For years, large incinerators have burned trash to generate power. Baltimore Refuse Energy Systems Co., the waste-to-energy plant near the stadiums, consumes up to 2,250 tons of refuse a day while producing steam and electricity.\nThe process is so expensive that it has only made sense to do it on a large scale, scientists say.\nThe military has spent almost $3 million on two Tiger prototypes, each weighing nearly 5 tons and small enough to fit into a 20- to 40-foot wide container. The project is being developed by scientists from the Edgewood, Va.-based Defense Life Sciences LLC and Indiana's Purdue University.\nThe biggest challenge was getting the parts to work together, said Donald Kennedy, an Edgewood spokesman. Because the Tiger is a hybrid consisting of a gasifier, bioreactor and generator, much of it is built with off-the-shelf items, including a grinder.\nAnother big challenge: expectations.\n\"When we would initially talk to people about the Tiger system, a large percentage would refuse to believe it could actually work,\" Kennedy wrote in an e-mail. \"Alternatively, a similar percentage would be so intrigued by the idea that they would demand to know when they could buy one for their neighborhood.\"\nThe Tiger works like this: A shredder rips up waste and soaks it in water. A bioreactor metabolizes the sludge into ethanol. A pelletizer compresses undigested waste into pellets that are fed into a gasification unit, which produces composite gas.\nThe ethanol, composite gas and a 10-percent diesel drip are injected into a diesel generator to produce electricity, according to scientists. It takes about six hours for the Tiger to power up. When it works, the device can power a 60-kilowatt generator.\nThe prototypes are being tested at Camp Victory in Baghdad\nInitial runs proved successful. The prototypes have been used to power an office trailer. At their peak, they could power two to three trailers.\nIn recent weeks, the scientists suffered a setback: The above-100 degree temperatures caused a chiller device to overheat and shut off occasionally. A new chiller from Edgewood just arrived at the site, Kennedy said.\nAfter the 90-day testing phase that ends Aug. 10, the Army will decide whether to fund the project further.\nIts developers envision the device being used to respond to crises such as Hurricane Katrina, when there is no lack of garbage but a great need for electricity.\nSpiller, of the Army's Rapid Equipping Force, said he is optimistic.\n\"The mere fact we wrote a check means we think it's got a high chance of success,\" Spiller said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:749f4f2e-01bf-42ab-ac03-1dfa84af34dc>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-07-21/news/0807200131_1_garbage-aberdeen-proving-ground-war-in-iraq", "date": "2013-05-18T07:16:57Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9598866701126099, "token_count": 1205, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Then and now, there is ample proof that Americans do take Supreme Court nominations seriously. With good reason.\nSooner or later, the nation's most vexing disagreements over our most vital issues wind up before the Supreme Court. None quite penetrates to the core of our democratic being more than those involving First Amendment rights and values.\nEach term, the nine justices must grapple with profound questions involving freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom to participate in political discourse: Just how free is freedom of speech? What is the role of religion in public life? Does national security trump the public's right to know?\nDuring the Court's last three terms, the First Amendment has not fared well. The high court has accepted for review far fewer free-expression-related cases than usual and it has been unusually stingy in recognizing First Amendment claims. In only two of the 15 decisions rendered in free-expression cases did the Court sustain those claims.\nHow the First Amendment will fare in the future depends on how Chief Justice John Roberts differs from his predecessor, William Rehnquist, and how Miers, if confirmed, differs from O'Connor.\nDuring his 33 years on the Court as an associate justice and chief justice, Rehnquist consistently voted against free-speech and free-press claims. O'Connor, however, played a pivotal role during her time as justice, frequently casting the decisive fifth vote in religion cases and occasionally in expression cases.\nThe justices over the next 12 months will hear arguments, review briefs and render opinions in several cases that have direct bearing on whether we have full or constricted freedoms when we wish to play a role in the crucial political, cultural or religious issues that confront us.\nIn five cases, the Court will once more take up the question of whether state laws regulating campaign contributions and expenditures pose an unconstitutional threat to political expression: Is money speech?\nThe issues of compelled speech and government funding of speech are raised in another case. A coalition of university law schools which object to the military's ban against acknowledged homosexuals contends that requiring them to allow military recruiters on campus violates their rights.\nAnother case tests the limits of the free exercise of religion. The justices will decide whether the federal government can prohibit a small group of followers of a Brazilian religious sect in New Mexico from importing a banned substance, a hallucinogenic tea, for use in its ceremonies.\nIn a case involving anti-abortion protests appearing before the Court for the third time since 1986, the justices' ruling could affect protest and picketing rights and practices.\nAnd a Los Angeles deputy district attorney wants the Court to declare that his free-speech rights were violated when he was disciplined for informing a defense attorney about ethical problems in a pending case.\nThe confirmation process for Miers should be complete by the end of the year. At present, chances seem good that she will be confirmed. Since 1789, the Senate has rejected only 34 of 155 nominations to the Supreme Court.\nNot much is known about Roberts' views on these issues; even less about Miers'. First Amendment advocates, of course, hope they set the new Court on a new course as far as free expression is concerned. In that regard, Justice Brandeis set a great example as a First Amendment champion during his 23 years on the Supreme Court.\n\"Those who won our independence,\" he wrote in 1927, \"believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.\"\nThe cause of liberty would be better served if this Court's future rulings transcend individual temperament and ideology to embrace the freedom for speech and the tolerance for belief that define a vital democracy.\nEditor's note: Paul K.

{"text": "Radisson Hotel Corp. is negotiating the purchase of a Near North Side site for a luxury hotel to open in early 1987, it was learned Monday.\nIf negotiations are successful and the hotel is built, it would be Radisson`s first downtown since it terminated a management agreement in late 1982 for the Radisson Chicago Hotel, now the Hotel Continental, 505 N. Michigan Ave.\nWilliam Hanley, vice president of marketing for the Minneapolis-based innkeeper, said Radisson hopes to begin construction this summer and open the hotel in early 1987. He declined to say exactly where the hotel may be built.\nThe new hotel is expected to have approximately 300 rooms, a health club, specialty restaurant and premium-priced concierge floors that would offer a higher level of service than elsewhere in the building, Hanley said.\nRadisson is returning to Chicago as part of long-range plans to expand nationwide to 139 hotels totaling 36,000 rooms by 1989 from 41 hotels with 12,100 rooms currently, Hanley said.\nThe firm`s plans locally call for the downtown facility; an all-suite hotel in west suburban Downers Grove, which would open ahead of the Near North hotel as Radisson`s first newly built property in the metropolitan area; the acquisition of an existing suburban property to be operated as a conventional hotel; and construction of two more hotels in the suburbs, he said.\nThe five facilities would contain 1,300 to 1,500 rooms, Hanley said.\nThe Downers Grove facility will be a 256-unit, $28 million ``Radisson Suites`` hotel at Wood Creek Drive and Butterfield Road in the Wood Creek Office Park, according to Walden Investment Corp. of Schaumburg.\nWalden Investment has started construction and expects to open the facility in the summer of 1986, said Herman S. Hefler, director of hotel operations for Walden. Walden`s Entrust Hotel Management Corp. affiliate will operate it under a franchise agreement with Radisson.\nThe 7-story building, designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, will have six floors of suites overlooking a skylighted, interior atrium; an indoor pool; exercise room; game room; sauna; valet and room service; and meeting facilities, Hefler said.\nEach suite will average 500 square feet, ``approximately double that of a conventional hotel room,`` and have a separate living room with microwave oven, refrigerator, wet bar, sofa-bed, dining-conference table, television and telephone, Hefler said.\nHefler said his firm also hopes to obtain franchises to build and operate Radisson Suites in north suburban Glenview and near O`Hare International Airport.\nHefler and Hanley declined to say exactly where in the suburbs the new hotels would be built, nor would Hanley identify the existing hotel now under negotiation.\nRadisson`s new all-suite line is patterned after its 96-unit Radisson Henley Park Hotel in Washington and the 126-unit Radisson Suite Hotel in Ogden, Utah, both of which officially opened in January, Hanley said.\n``We`ll probably have about five (all-suite hotels) totaling about 1,100 rooms in operation nationally by the beginning of 1986,`` he said.\nThe facilities will open in areas containing concentrations of high-technology companies and national and regional corporate headquarters, ``where you`d experience a fair amount of training programs and people coming in for longer stays,`` Hanley said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:89b3d430-8ea0-4fea-b8ca-f559f50993a6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-03-12/business/8501140340_1_conventional-hotel-all-suite-two-more-hotels", "date": "2013-05-18T07:27:19Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9442341923713684, "token_count": 736, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "LENINGRAD — Imagine George Washington as hateful.\nImagine a campaign to rename Washington, D.C., as the most cherished political hope of residents in the nation`s capital.\nImagine the Founding Fathers discredited and in disgrace, blamed rather than praised for the American Revolution, while the new president and his Congress scurry to rewrite the Constitution and the history books to keep the country from disintegrating into 50 independent states. Imagine National Guard tanks already on patrol in several state capitals to keep the peace.\nThen imagine trying to grow up in this atmosphere of shattered ideology and faith, and you might just be able to understand why I see a crisis in Soviet youth.\nIt is a quiet crisis, because its manifestation is apathy and studied indifference toward everything but the most personal concerns.\nLiving in Leningrad for the past half-year, I have spent a great deal of time with teenagers and young adults, going to school with them, hanging out after school with them, and talking, talking, talking with them.\nThey are the Soviet ``Lost Generation.``\nAt a Leningrad high school, I was talking about belief with a 16-year-old who immediately responded that her age group ``could best be described as nihilists.``\nHer parents` generation grew up with a comforting belief that dictator Joseph Stalin saved the nation from the Nazis and rebuilt its economy. But youth raised during glasnost know the truth about his labor camps, show trials and mass executions.\n``For us, there was no way we could believe in Stalin, since I, for instance, began hearing the truth about Stalin when I was 7-my father told me,`` she said.\nIndifference is the primary characteristic of contemporary teenagers, as one parent related to me. This indifference is selective, protective, directed at Soviet society, politics and economics, which have never evinced any interest in improving young people`s lives, but only in complicating them.\nThus, young Leningraders` indifference toward their own society is paired with a thirst not only for information about the West but also for the life there. Nearly without exception, Soviets aged 16 to 26 hate politics and only want a better life.\nOne variation of this attitude manifests itself in a desire to emigrate, mostly seen in those over 18 and out of school. They distrust their political system and its politicians, and thus have no desire to participate. Recent bloodshed in the Baltics and the insulting monetary reform, in which people`s life`s savings were wiped out overnight, only reinforced this distrust.\nThose who do participate in political life are a small minority. They join such fringe groups as the Monarchists-who call for the return of the czarist autocracy-or Anarchists-who believe that having no system is better than having one.\nThere are several preservationist movements, with more wholesome platforms, in which young people participate, one dedicated to the\narchitectural renaissance of Leningrad and another whose politics parallel the West European Greens Party.\nThe Komsomol, or Young Communist League, like an ideological Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, has a dwindling cadre. Participation once was a prerequisite for future professional standing, but today its members remain more from inertia than interest.\nA 16-year-old told me she is still a komsomolka, but only because she retains a membership card. There are rarely meetings these days, and she never attends.\nSteps toward a market economy and private property also brought changes in Soviet youth. Some young Leningraders doubt the value of finishing their higher education at technical or professional institutes, or of ever working officially at all if they have obtained their decrees.\nThanks to the current inflation, they have seen their parents` salaries becoming laughably insufficient, and realize they would be better off at semi- legal biznes-or even plying the illegal black market-than trusting the system that betrayed their parents.\nYoung speculators who bribe their way into possession of scarce consumer goods at government prices resell them at a price 10 times higher, netting in one day more than an honest worker makes in a month. One 25-year-old told me he dropped out of an engineering institute because he can earn more as a private car mechanic in the shadow economy. And black marketeers, who often earn their profits in Western currencies, live the most golden life of all, even if it is totally illegal.\nThese are the new hero-workers of Soviet society.\nThe cultural effects on Soviet teenagers of the current social transformations tend to be more subtle. For ethnic Russians, their identity is reinforced by joining the recently unfettered Orthodox Church; last January, the Russian Orthodox Christmas was officially celebrated for the first time in 74 years. One teen told me she even was christened last fall-at her own intitiative.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8062d160-06b6-4983-98b6-ba363d5a0361>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-26/news/9101180458_1_soviet-youth-leningrad-quiet-crisis", "date": "2013-05-18T05:31:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9697725772857666, "token_count": 1002, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "It would be a cinch for retirees to figure out how much money they can spend without running out if they could count on their investments growing at a set rate each year.\nBut as the past 18 months have reminded investors, the market is not only unpredictable, but can go down, too.\nCalculating how much money to draw out of a retirement nest egg each year is complicated. It can even be harder than saving for retirement, experts said.\n\"You have more variables to contend with,\" said Christopher L. Jones, executive vice president with Financial Engines. How much to withdraw depends on the amount saved, taxes, life expectancy, what portion is in stocks or bonds, and whether the money is in tax-deferred accounts or not, he said.\nAnd there's timing. Retire just as a bear market hits and your nest egg will shrink a lot faster than the portfolio of someone lucky enough to retire in a bull market.\nFinancial planners say people often assume that they can safely withdraw 8 percent to 10 percent a year from invested assets throughout retirement, excluding what they receive from pensions and Social Security. That's about twice the rate generally recommended.\nChristine Fahlund, a senior financial planner with T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, said she's often greeted with skepticism at seminars when she suggests a 4 percent or 5 percent initial withdrawal rate from a portfolio, with slight increases thereafter to keep up with inflation.\nHer audience tends to become more accepting when she explains the huge hit that their portfolios will take if they withdraw 8 percent from a portfolio that's fallen 3 percent. \"We are getting a lot of believers now that the market is down,\" she said.\nSo, how does a retiree figure a realistic withdrawal rate?\nFortunately, planning in recent years has become more sophisticated than just basing withdrawals on a projected average annual return and average inflation rate.\nComputers now run portfolios and withdrawals through hundreds and thousands of economic scenarios and tell retirees the likelihood of their money lasting in retirement.\nPrice offers its free online version, the Retirement Income Calculator, at www.troweprice.com. Financial Engines next year will launch technology that shows retirees how much to invest, how much to draw down and from what accounts based on assets and income, including Social Security and pensions.\nIf you are trying to determine a withdrawal rate, here are some factors to consider:\n- Life expectancy. This depends on a person's health, gender and family history of longevity. Generally, people are living longer and need to plan for that.\nRockville, Md., financial planner Marvin Burt said a decade ago that he would use a life expectancy of 85 when developing retirement plans. He later upped that to 90 and recently started using 95. Couples must factor in the life expectancy of each partner, especially if one is much younger than the other, he said.\n- Asset allocation. Retirees should have at least 25 percent of their portfolio invested in stocks to help keep up with inflation, but probably no more than 70 percent in equities, Fahlund said.\nStocks add volatility to a portfolio, and investing too heavily in them can exacerbate the effects of a down market.\n\"You'll find the volatility can work against you over time,\" Fahlund said. \"You might have to withdraw a little less than you can if you are well-balanced.\"\nAlso, avoid the mistake of trying to make up for a lack of saving by aggressive investing, which can backfire, warned Jack Brod, head of Vanguard Advisory Services in Malvern, Pa.\nSome retirees with long life expectancies also may want to consider buying an annuity as part of their portfolio to provide a lifelong income stream, suggested Jones.\n- Timing. Not only how much you take out each year matters, but whether you start tapping into your nest egg in an up or down market can be critical.\n\"The worst thing is to have a big market downturn early on in your retirement. That will affect all future years,\" Jones said.\nTake the case of a retiree who assumes an annual return of 9 percent on a $500,000 portfolio and withdraws about 7 percent the first year, increasing that yearly for inflation. Based on a portfolio of 60 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 10 percent cash, the retiree would run out of money in 25 years if the market performed according to plan, according to a calculation by Price.\nBut what if that person retired in 1973, just as the market headed into two years of negative returns? Using actual market returns, Price found that the retiree would run out of money about six years ahead of schedule if no adjustment to withdrawals was made.\nHowever, if the retiree started out with a more conservative withdrawal rate or reduced withdrawals after the bear market, he or she would have wound up with a hefty portfolio balance after 23 years because of the bull market.", "id": "<urn:uuid:19b9d6c9-6af7-46b5-8a62-6b8a623b4861>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-11-20/business/0111200175_1_withdrawal-rate-thousands-of-economic-scenarios-retirement-income-calculator", "date": "2013-05-18T06:56:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9679765701293945, "token_count": 1009, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean; Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Its location on the main floor (the museum's third floor) sits near old favorites like the coal mine and newer ones such as \"Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination.\" The trees may be better suited for older kids and adults who would enjoy the sight of pickle and spider-web ornaments, while younger kids might have more fun at the hatchery, watching baby chicks emerge from their shells.\nPrice: Included with general admission ($11 for adults, $9.50 for seniors, $7 for children ages 3-11).\nDaley Plaza and Christkindlmarket\nBest for: Multigenerational, Family-friendly, First-timers, Singles, Romantic couples, Budget, Sightseers\nFigure in: 2 hours to browse through the huts and nosh on Germany's many encased meats.\nGeography: 50 W.

Less than 5-minute walk (.17 miles) from \"Holiday Central.\" Walk 2 blocks north.\nWhat to know: One day, the Food and Drug Administration should pay a visit to the Christkindlmarket at the Daley Plaza. They'd find the perfect cure for cold, blustery days in leberkase (topped here with mustard and served on a kaiser roll). Chase that with a cup of gluhwein (a hot spiced wine) and let the warmth envelop you like a summer day in Nuremberg. Chicago's market, started in 1995, was meant to resemble the original Christmas market held in the German city, with its red and white huts and craft-selling artisans. But don't go just for the European chocolates and lace table linens. Go for the 90-foot-tall Christmas tree adorned with thousands of lights and ornaments. Really. You know a bigger Christmas tree? Christkindlmarket runs Nov. 22-Dec. 24.

{"text": "Military families are a key voting bloc in battleground Virginia, but one group fears its voice will be under-represented on Election Day.\nRequests for absentee ballots from members of the armed services, their spouses and dependents could be down sharply from 2008, according to statistics from the Military Voter Protection Project, which is seeking to boost voter participation among troops.\nThe blame for the anemic numbers rests with the Defense Department, which has been slow to enact reforms that make it easier to register, said Eric Eversole, founder and executive director of MVP.\n\"I see a significant amount of foot-dragging,\" Eversole said Tuesday.\nThe Pentagon takes \"strong issue\" with the MVP report, spokesman George Little said Tuesday, saying its figures are dated and doesn't take into account recent outreach efforts.\nAs of late August, 1,746 absentee ballot requests came from military families in Virginia, the group said. For all of 2008, the number was 20,738.\nEversole's group recently released an update that tracked a slightly different population: military members, their families and civilian overseas voters. There was still a shortfall. The current number of requests as of Sept. 22 from that group was nearly 13,000. That's a drop of 70 percent from 2008, when the number was 41,762.\nAlthough more requests are coming in every day, the gap between this year and 2008 is so wide in both groups that it raises serious concerns, Eversole said.\n\"The number of absentee ballots being requested is shockingly low,\" he said.\nThe group also released data that cited shortfalls compared to 2008 in Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and Illinois.\nA federal official countered Tuesday that government outreach efforts are better than ever, and warned against comparing figures from this political season with the 2008 race, because the two campaigns are different.\nPam Mitchell, acting director for the Federal Voter Assistance Program, said activity on the program's web site – which includes site visits and downloading of applications – is comparable to 2004. That was the last time an incumbent president faced off against a challenger. The 2008 race was different, she noted, because the nomination was wide open on both sides and therefore could have attracted more voter interest.\nLittle, the Pentagon spokesman, cited another reason why a 2012 and 2008 comparison isn't valid.\n\"They did a compare and contrast between this year and 2008,\" Little said. \"And it's important to remember that there -- the number of deployed service members, especially in the war zones, has declined significantly. So just as an example, the Virginia National Guard, as I understand it, has all units home for the first time in 10 years. We have ended the war in Iraq. We have drawn down in Afghanistan. And it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.\"\nAnother issue is whether the Defense Department has followed through on changes required by the 2009 Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act, or MOVE. One provision required a voter assistance office at every military installation – not necessarily a free-standing office, but a place where incoming soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines could register to vote, change address or receive other assistance when they first arrived on base.\nEversole said the department was slow to create the offices, and some offices were placed in out-of-the way locations.\nMitchell said the government is now \"fully compliant\" with the MOVE Act, with 221 voter assistance offices at bases in the U.S. and around the world.\nLangley Air Force Base in Hampton has a voter assistance office at the Bateman Library, said 1st Lt. John Cooper, a base spokesman who is also the installation's voting assistance officer. Airman can come to the office by appointment, and there is a dedicated email box for questions and concerns. Perhaps most importantly, voting assistance is available at briefings for incoming airmen, he said.\nInformation on voter assistance was not available from Fort Eustis in Newport News and Naval Station Norfolk.\nMeanwhile, Virginia officials have gotten into the act trying to promote military voter participation.\nBack on Sept. 15, state officials publicized National Military Voter Readiness Day, encouraging members of the armed forces to apply for absentee ballots well in advance of the deadline.\nIn Virginia, requests to vote absentee by mail must be received by the State Board of Elections by close of business on Oct. 30, said board spokeswoman Nikki Sheridan.\nThose in the armed services and others who live overseas are advised to mail their requests well before that day.\n\"I can't reiterate enough, the time is now,\" Sheridan said.\nVirginia voting deadlines\nOct. 15: Deadline to apply to register to vote\nOct. 30: Requests to vote absentee by mail must be received by close of business on this day.", "id": "<urn:uuid:06de4695-e05b-4d18-ab20-e676c74a6cd4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.dailypress.com/2012-10-02/news/dp-nws-military-absentee-voting-20121002_1_eric-eversole-military-voter-protection-project-absentee-ballots", "date": "2013-05-18T08:11:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9743682742118835, "token_count": 986, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "by Dan Barker\nDear Believer, — You asked me to consider Christianity as the answer for my life. I have done that. I consider it untrue, repugnant, and harmful.\nYou expect me to believe Jesus was born of a virgin impregnated by a ghost? Do you believe all the crazy tales of ancient religions? Julius Caesar was reportedly born of a virgin; Roman historian Seutonius said Augustus bodily rose to heaven when he died; and Buddha was supposedly born speaking. You don’t believe all that, do you? Why do you expect me to swallow the fables of Christianity?\nI find it incredible that you ask me to believe that the earth was created in six literal days; women come from a man’s rib; a snake, a donkey, and a burning bush spoke human language; the entire world was flooded, covering the mountains to drown evil; all animal species, millions of them, rode on one boat; language variations stem from the tower of Babel; Moses had a magic wand; the Nile turned to blood; a stick turned into a snake; witches, wizards, and sorcerers really exist; food rained from the sky for 40 years; people were cured by the sight of a brass serpent; the sun stood still to help Joshua win a battle, and it went backward for King Hezekiah; men survived unaided in a fiery furnace; a detached hand floated in the air and wrote on a wall; men followed a star which directed them to a particular house; Jesus walked on water unaided; fish and bread magically multiplied to feed the hungry; water instantly turned into wine; mental illness is caused by demons; a “devil” with wings exists who causes evil; people were healed by stepping into a pool agitated by angels; disembodied voiced spoke from the sky; Jesus vanished and later materialized from thin air; people were healed by Peter’s shadow; angels broke people out of jail; a fiery lake of eternal torment awaits unbelievers under the earth ... while there is life-after-death in a city which is 1,500 miles cubed, with mansions and food, for Christians only.\nIf you believe these stories, then you are the one with the problem, not me. These myths violate natural law, contradict science, and fail to correspond with reality or logic. If you can’t see that, then you can’t separate truth from fantasy. It doesn’t matter how many people accept delusions inflicted by “holy” men; a widely held lie is still a lie. If you are so gullible, then you are like the child who believes the older brother who says there is a monster in the hallway. But there is nothing to be afraid of; go turn on the light and look for yourself.\nIf Christianity were simply untrue I would not be too concerned. Santa is untrue, but it is a harmless myth which people outgrow. But Christianity, besides being false, is also abhorrent. It amazes me that you claim to love the god of the bible, a hateful, arrogant, sexist, cruel being who can’t tolerate criticism. I would not want to live in the same neighborhood with such a creature!\nThe biblical god is a macho male warrior. Though he said “Thou shalt not kill,” he ordered death for all opposition, wholesale drowning and mass exterminations; punishes offspring to the fourth generation (Ex. 20:5); ordered pregnant women and children to be ripped up (Hos. 13:16); demands animal and human blood to appease his angry vanity; is partial to one race of people; judges women to be inferior to men; is a sadist who created a hell to torture unbelievers; created evil (Is. 45:7); discriminated against the handicapped (Lev. 21:18-23); ordered virgins to be kept as spoils of war (Num. 31:15-18, Deut. 21:11-14); spread dung on people’s faces (Mal. 2:3); sent bears to devour 42 children who teased a prophet (II Kings 2:23-24); punishes people with snakes, dogs, dragons, drunkenness, swords, arrows, axes, fire, famine, and infanticide; and said fathers should eat their sons (Ez. 5:10). Is that nice? Would you want to live next door to such a person?\nAnd Jesus is a chip off the old block. He said, “I and my father are one,” and he upheld “every jot and tittle” of the Old Testament law. Mt. 5:18 He preached the same old judgment: vengeance and death, wrath and distress, hell and torture for all nonconformists. He believed in demons, angels and spirits. He never denounced the subjugation of slaves or women. Women were excluded as disciples and as guests at his heavenly table. Except for hell he introduced nothing new to ethics or philosophy. He was disrespectful of his mother and brothers; he said we should hate our parents and desert our families. Mt. 10:35-36, Lk. 14:26 (So much for “Christian family life.”) He denounced anger, but was often angry himself. Mt. 5:22, Mk. 3:5 He called people “fools” (Mt. 23:17,19), “serpents,” and “white sepulchers,” though he warned that such language puts you in danger of hellfire. Mt. 5:22 He said “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword.\" Mt. 10:34 (So much for “Peace on Earth.”) He irrationally cursed and withered a fig tree for being barren out of season. Mt. 21:19 He mandated burning unbelievers. Jn. 15:6 (The Church has complied with relish.) He stole a horse. Lk. 19:30-33 He told people to cut off hands, feet, eyes and sexual organs. Mt. 5:29-30, 19:12 You want me to accept Jesus, but I think I’ll pick my own friend, thank you.\nOne of Jesus’s many contradictions was saying good works should be seen, and not seen. Mt. 5:16, 6:1-4 One of his mistakes was saying that the mustard plant has the smallest seed. Mt. 13:31-32 The writers of Matthew and Luke could not even get his genealogy straight, contradicting the Old Testament, and giving Jesus two discrepant lines through Joseph, his non-father!\nI also find Christianity to be morally repugnant. The concepts of original sin, depravity, substitutionary forgiveness, intolerance, eternal punishment, and humble worship are all beneath the dignity of intelligent human beings and conflict with the values of kindness and reason. They are barbaric ideas for primitive cultures cowering in fear and ignorance.\nFinally, Christianity is harmful. More people have been killed in the name of a god than for any other reason. The Church has a shameful, bloody history of Crusades, Inquisitions, witch-burnings, heresy trials, American colonial intolerance, disrespect of indigenous traditions (such as American Indians), support of slavery, and oppression of women. Modern “fruits” of religion include the Jonestown massacre, the callous fraud of “faith healers,” recent wars and ethnic cleansing, and fighting in Northern Ireland. Religion also poses a danger to mental health, damaging self-respect, personal responsibility, and clarity of thought.\nDo you see why I do not respect the biblical message? It is an insulting bag of nonsense. You have every right to torment yourself with such insanity — but leave me out of it.

{"text": "TURTLE BAY, Hawaii — The surf rolls in with tumbling white crests over the sculptured coral on the far north coast of Oahu, capital island of Hawaii.\nKuilima Point, a finger of land reaching out into the Pacific Ocean, catches the surf and keeps a small private bay serene for quiet snorkeling. The warm sands along the beach invite sunbathing.\nOut on the point, 400 guest rooms and suites in three low-rise wings overlook the challenging surf.\nGuest cottages are nested in tropical greenery above the surf, with a tennis club in its own greenery behind the cottages. Surrounding the resort is the 18-hole Arnold Palmer golf course.\nHonolulu and Waikiki are an hour's drive away, across north Oahu's fields of sugar cane.\nIn 1972, Oahu's only North Shore resort opened as the Del Webb Kuilima Hotel on Turtle Bay, encompassing 808 acres of ocean-front land near the town of Kahuku.\nIn 1984, after a $17-million renovation, the resort reopened as the Turtle Bay Hilton & Country Club.\nNew Hotels Planned\nAsahi Jyuken, an investment and development company based in Osaka, Japan, paid about $127.5 million to buy the resort from Prudential Insurance Co., which has been the owner since the Del Webb era of the 1970s and early 1980s. Hilton Hotels will continue to operate the resort.\nThe Japanese firm intends to build another hotel on adjacent Kawela Bay, a project that had received all necessary permits before the sale. Two more hotels, another 18-hole golf course and a second equestrian center also are planned, along with 2,000 condominium units.\nWill Turtle Bay continue to seem area codes away from Honolulu and Waikiki?\nThe same kind of question was being asked by local people and environmentalists when we first came here 16 years ago, when the Kuilima Hotel was less than a month away from its grand opening.\nLater we heard that Del Webb had reached out from Las Vegas to north Oahu with the belief and hope that casino gambling would soon be legalized in Hawaii.\nIt never happened. Kuilima is no longer a destination name. The postal address is still Kahuku, but the resort area has come to be known as Turtle Bay, which is the wide bay open to the sea, not the private bay protected by the point.\nAs we arrived from Waikiki, surfers were out waiting for the big waves. Some of the best surf in the world is found at the \"Pipeline,\" just beyond Kawela Bay and off Sunset Beach.\nThe golf course is home of the Arnold Palmer Golf School and is managed by the Arnold Palmer Golf Management Co. The Arnold Palmer/Sam Snead \"Legends of Golf\" tournament is held here in January; top women pros compete in February.\nFor guests there are complimentary golf clinics Tuesday and Thursday mornings. Greens fees with carts are $45 for guests. The Turtle Bay Twosome golf package is $95 per person per night, double occupancy; it includes ocean-view accommodations and a round of golf.\nThe Peter Burwash professional tennis organization manages the tennis club and has complimentary clinics for guests three mornings a week. The Tennis Holiday package is $77.50 per person per night, double occupancy, for accommodations, court time and a private lesson.\nOther sports on the North Coast include horseback riding, windsurfing and scuba diving. Quilting, lei-making and leaf weaving are quieter options.\nDining is in the Cove restaurant and out on the Palm Terrace, with Sunday champagne brunch in the Sea Tide Room. Evening entertainment can be found in the Bay View Lounge.\nConstruction of the next hotel on Kawela Bay is scheduled to start in 1 1/2 years and will take about two years to complete.

{"text": "Those multicultural slackers, hipper and less corn-fed than the groups gamboling across the pages of Vogue or the spiffily dressed junior execs who star in ads targeted for Forbes or GQ, will be seen in Vibe, Wired, Details and Rolling Stone. Bus shelters in a number of cities are papered with an unstudly, shirtless guy in Tommy jeans, the FIGER on his underwear waistband peeping out above his slender hip. The irresistible kindergarten-recess portrait used for Tommy Hilfiger boys ads features diverse children dressed in rolled-up khakis and polos bearing the Hilfiger lion crest. They look like they could teach world leaders how to play in the sandbox harmoniously.\nImage maintenance is just one crucial element of the strategy that helped make Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A. the No. 1 apparel firm traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Barbara Bates, president of the company, worked at Polo for 10 years before joining Hilfiger in 1991. \"Obviously, the product had to be great,\" she says. \"But the presentation, the visual merchandising, having our own shops within the department stores, having our own selling specialists, was all important. That was a formula that had worked very well at Polo. Creating the hype behind it was a formula that had worked very successfully also, so we very aggressively went after that, first in men's, then in boys, we're doing it in denim right now, and we're launching women's wear the same way.\"\nRalph Lauren, who has just inaugurated two younger, lower-priced lines to combat Hilfiger's encroachment, was an unwitting tutor. \"Ralph and I have very similar taste,\" Hilfiger says. \"We both love the classics. I think Ralph has done an incredible job, and if anybody has been an influence in America, he has.\"\nIn the 14-person Hilfiger design studio, the major collections and mini-groups that roll out every month are developed. Each is designed around a theme, a location or an activity in which form follows function. The themes impart a look and a palette and conjure visions of a fantasy lifestyle: Expedition, Alpine, Nautical, Tailgate, Bermuda, Back Bay. Lauren began working with themes in the '70s: Sun Valley, Santa Fe, Safari. A genealogical chart of traditional American style would trace a line from Brooks Brothers to Lauren to Hilfiger.\n\"I take the classic idea and mix it with a lot of different inspirations,\" Hilfiger says. \"I made my shirts oversized and I made them relaxed. I washed the cotton shirts till they were soft. I made my chinos baggy and loose. Now I'm looking at board sports and getting inspiration from what the snowboarders and surfers wear.\"\n\"Five minutes to first outfit.

{"text": "The vaunted protection that intellectually active adults get from Alzheimer’s disease has a dark downside, a study released Wednesday has found. Once dementia symptoms become evident and Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed in such patients, their mental decline can come with frightening speed.\nThat finding, published in the journal Neurology, comes from a study of 1,157 Chicago-based seniors who were followed for an average of just over 11 years. Six years after gauging the extent to which the study participants engaged in activities that challenged their mental capacities, researchers from Rush University Medical Center Alzheimer’s Disease Center made periodic assessments of the study participants’ cognitive health and traced the trajectories of their brain health.\nAll told, 148 of the participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease during the follow-up period, and 395 were found to have mild cognitive impairment—intellectual problems that are less severe than Alzheimer’s disease, but which often precede such a diagnosis.\nWhile all participants’ mental function showed yearly declines, the steepest downward trajectories belonged to those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, but who had reported high levels of mental engagement at the outset of the study. Fellow Alzheimer’s sufferers who had not sought out much intellectual stimulation at the study’s outset showed a more gradual decline in their function.\n“In effect, the results of this study suggest that the benefit of delaying the initial appearance of cognitive impairment [in Alzheimer’s disease] comes at the cost of more rapid dementia progression,” the author wrote.\nThe findings support a common observation of those who treat intellectually minded patients who go on to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease—that once diagnosed, their decline is rapid. It also underscores a growing body of evidence that the bright and mentally-active may not beat Alzheimer’s disease, but can hold off its ravages for months or years longer than those who are not so engaged.\nDr. John M. Ringman, a UCLA neurologist and assistant director of the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research, said he sees regular evidence of the phenomenonen in his clinical work, as well as in brain-imaging scans that can detect the physical signs of Alzheimer’s disease while a patient is still alive: Patients with a history of intensive mental engagement seem to develop a “cognitive reserve,” said Dr. Ringman. That mental strength frequently allows them to function almost normally, he said, even as the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallmarks of the disease have advanced upon the brain.\nBy the time such a patient comes to his office complaining that his memory and mental function are not what they used to be, the disease has progressed significantly, said Ringman. The decline from that point can be precipitous.\nIn a disease that evidence now suggests takes years, perhaps decades, to show up in everyday behavior, Ringman said “it’s hard to quantify this cognitive reserve.” The strength of the study published Wednesday is that it gathered copious evidence of participants’ mental status and activity at the outset and followed them for more than a decade, he added.\n--Melissa Healy/Los Angeles Times", "id": "<urn:uuid:5d156165-181a-4195-a926-d51850c7b599>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/01/news/la-heb-alzheimers-20100901", "date": "2013-05-18T06:22:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9584160447120667, "token_count": 679, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Belgian physicist Francois Englert, left, speaks with British physicist… (Fabrice Coffrini / AFP/Getty…)\nFor physicists, it was a moment like landing on the moon or the discovery of DNA.\nThe focus was the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that exists for a mere fraction of a second. Long theorized but never glimpsed, the so-called God particle is thought to be key to understanding the existence of all mass in the universe. The revelation Wednesday that it -- or some version of it -- had almost certainly been detected amid more than hundreds of trillions of high-speed collisions in a 17-mile track near Geneva prompted a group of normally reserved scientists to erupt with joy.\nFor The Record\nLos Angeles Times Friday, July 06, 2012 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 48 words Type of Material: Correction\nLarge Hadron Collider: In some copies of the July 5 edition, an article in Section A about the machine used by physicists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research to search for the Higgs boson referred to the $5-billion Large Hadron Collider. The correct amount is $10 billion.\nPeter Higgs, one of the scientists who first hypothesized the existence of the particle, reportedly shed tears as the data were presented in a jampacked and applause-heavy seminar at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\"It's a gigantic triumph for physics,\" said Frank Wilczek, an MIT physicist and Nobel laureate. \"It's a tremendous demonstration of a community dedicated to understanding nature.\"\nThe achievement, nearly 50 years in the making, confirms physicists' understanding of how mass -- the stuff that makes stars, planets and even people -- arose in the universe, they said.\nIt also points the way toward a new path of scientific inquiry into the mass-generating mechanism that was never before possible, said UCLA physicist Robert Cousins, a member of one of the two research teams that has been chasing the Higgs boson at CERN.\n\"I compare it to turning the corner and walking around a building -- there's a whole new set of things you can look at,\" he said. \"It is a beginning, not an end.\"\nLeaders of the two teams reported independent results that suggested the existence of a previously unseen subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 to 126 billion electron volts. Both groups got results at a \"five sigma\" level of confidence -- the statistical requirement for declaring a scientific \"discovery.\"\n\"The chance that either of the two experiments had seen a fluke is less than three parts in 10 million,\" said UC San Diego physicist Vivek Sharma, a former leader of one of the Higgs research groups. \"There is no doubt that we have found something.\"\nBut he and others stopped just shy of saying that this new particle was indeed the long-sought Higgs boson. \"All we can tell right now is that it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck,\" Sharma said.\nIn this case, quacking was enough for most.\n\"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably at least a bird,\" said Wilczek, who stayed up past 3 a.m. to watch the seminar live over the Web while vacationing in New Hampshire.\nCertainly CERN leaders in Geneva, even as they referred to their discovery simply as \"a new particle,\" didn't bother hiding their excitement.\nThe original plan had been to present the latest results on the Higgs search at the International Conference on High Energy Physics, a big scientific meeting that began Wednesday in Melbourne.\nBut as it dawned on CERN scientists that they were on the verge of \"a big announcement,\" Cousins said, officials decided to honor tradition and instead present the results on CERN's turf.\nThe small number of scientists who theorized the existence of the Higgs boson in the 1960s -- including Higgs of the University of Edinburgh -- were invited to fly to Geneva.\nFor the non-VIP set, lines to get into the auditorium began forming late Tuesday. Many spent the night in sleeping bags.\nAll the hubbub was due to the fact that the discovery of the Higgs boson is the last piece of the puzzle needed to complete the so-called Standard Model of particle physics -- the big picture that describes the subatomic particles that make up everything in the universe, and the forces that work between them.\nOver the course of the 20th century, as physicists learned more about the Standard Model, they struggled to answer one very basic question: Why does matter exist?\nHiggs and others came up with a possible explanation: that particles gain mass by traveling through an energy field. One way to think about it is that the field sticks to the particles, slowing them down and imparting mass.\nThat energy field came to be known as the Higgs field. The particle associated with the field was dubbed the Higgs boson.\nHiggs published his theory in 1964. In the 48 years since, physicists have eagerly chased the Higgs boson. Finding it would provide the experimental confirmation they needed to show that their current understanding of the Standard Model was correct.\nOn the other hand, ruling it out would mean a return to the drawing board to look for an alternative Higgs particle, or several alternative Higgs particles, or perhaps to rethink the Standard Model from the bottom up.\nEither outcome would be monumental, scientists said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:fb237ffb-9cc0-4077-99d5-56c6fce1ca5f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/05/science/la-sci-higgs-boson-new-particle-20120705", "date": "2013-05-18T08:11:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9634510278701782, "token_count": 1134, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Where to put special education students in Lehighton Area School District buildings has been a longstanding problem for district officials.\nAs with most districts throughout the area, Lehighton has an increasing number of special education students and not enough space to put them.\nAlthough the School Board ended one space problem with a move made at this week's meeting, members learned that another problem has arisen.\nAccording to acting Superintendent Robert Nagle, the district must provide three classrooms as part of a fair share program with the Carbon-Lehigh Intermediate Unit.\nThe fair share program allows Lehighton to send its special education students to another district for instruction. As part of the agreement, however, Lehighton must return the favor sometime.\nNagle said a current special education classroom at the Franklin Elementary School has been found to be substandard because it can only hold six students instead of 15.\nOne room in the high school is substandard and a resource room in the East Penn Elementary School is moved around as rooms become available, Nagle said.\nIn addition, Nagle said, the district must find two classrooms for Lehighton students presently attending classes in the Palmerton Area School District. Palmerton has informed the intermediate unit that it will need the classrooms next school term for its own students.\n\"What we're finding in the Lehighton School District is that we simply don't have the room,\" Nagle said.\nRobert J. Klucharich, director of curriculum and instruction in the Lehighton district, briefed the board on several ways of creating more classroom space.\nKlucharich said a former school building in the Packerton section of Mahoning Township could be used to house the district's administrative offices. Klucharich said the move would open up space in the Shull-David Elementary School, the present location of the administrative offices.\nPortable facilities could also be used to increase available space for classrooms, Klucharich said.\nA long-term solution to the problem, according to Klucharich, would be to integrate or mainstream special education students into regular classrooms.\nThe School Board took no action on Klucharich's suggestions, but did authorize district officials to continue a study on how to solve the problem and to make a recommendation at a future meeting.\nThe board did, however, improve the junior high special education situation by agreeing to allow nine seventh-grade students to be inte grated into regular classrooms on a full-time basis.\nJames Smith, the junior high school principal, called the move a \"compassionate alternative to isolation.\"\nThe nine students, composing an entire class, are termed self-contained, and have some degree of learning disability or are classified as mildly emotionally or mentally retarded.\nUnder the plan, the students will attend all classes with regular education students. Intermediate unit personnel and junior high teachers will meet to discuss an educational program for the students.\nEach student will receive a grade from the intermediate unit teacher, who will continue to teach English and reading to the nine students.\nSmith has said the move will have no effect on classes attended by regular students, and will help improve the self-esteem of the special education students.\n\"Children will no longer be isolated from other students and all students will have a chance to participate in experiments, view quality educational media, and socialize with all of the other students in the junior high,\" Smith said.\nThe special education students had previously been integrated or mainstreamed into classes such as art, shop and physical education. The students will now be taking course such as science, social studies, math, geography and skills for adolescence while sitting next to regular education students.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8c42f89f-3538-49cd-9283-6b4d7d994a9a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.mcall.com/1989-03-01/news/2675029_1_special-education-students-regular-classrooms-district-s-administrative-offices", "date": "2013-05-18T06:57:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.965471088886261, "token_count": 747, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Spearing for pike and musky was slow and no reports on walleye.\nBlack Lake: Was producing some nice perch but catch rates were slow. A few muskie were caught.\nGrand Lake: Is producing some perch and panfish. For pike and walleye, try tip-ups in Whiskey Bay or Black Bass Bay.\nVan Etten Lake: Ice anglers were catching a few perch.\nHiggins Lake: Smelt have been caught in the evening along the west side of the lake between Big Creek and the North State Park. The fish are suspended in 30 to 40 feet of water. Lake trout and whitefish are still in the North Bay in 80 to 100 feet of water. Try gray shiners for lake trout or wax worms and wigglers for whitefish. Those pike spearing off Sam-O-Set Park have taken fish in 15 to 18 feet of water. Perch were also caught in the same area in 20 to 40 feet of water however anglers will need to sort out the small ones. Perch can still be found off Point Detroit and Flag Point.\nHoughton Lake: Nothing on panfish yet however with the warm up, bluegill and crappie should start biting. For walleye, fish the west side of the lake.\nTawas: Fishing was slow but perch anglers were still targeting waters 15 to 20 feet deep and 20 feet for walleye. Pike spearing was slow because of muddy water.\nAu Gres: Produced a few walleye straight out in 32 feet of water and off Booth Road in 26 to 30 feet of water. Rumor has it pike spearing has picked up and so has the success rate south of the breakwall and in the bayous.", "id": "<urn:uuid:d9fd20f9-00e7-4686-8b97-2774d140f15e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.petoskeynews.com/2011-01-26/perch-fishing_27051185", "date": "2013-05-18T05:30:15Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9780257940292358, "token_count": 1013, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Actually, Caputo is referring to the male heart, because he is a very male author whose idea of a good time is to hook a marlin in the waters near his home in Key West, Fla., to fight that fish to the finish and thus experience, as he once put it, \"the pleasant pain (and) the cleansing exhaustion that come after a hard-fought battle.\" No, Caputo will never be mistaken for Alan Alda, not with his boxer's build and the slight limp in his gait, the latter courtesy of wounds suffered in Beirut 12 years ago when a sniper felled him with rounds from a Soviet rifle.\nTen years ago this spring, Caputo published a memoir, A Rumor of War, which became the first Vietnam best seller at a time when the war was a taboo topic and vets were often treated as lepers. Today, ironically, with war books flooding the market and Platoon topping the box-office charts, Caputo vows that his fourth work (and third novel), the newly released Indian Country, is his last substantive word on what happened.\nHis fans might be disappointed to learn this - Caputo is our most prominent macho man of letters, the heir to Hemingway and Conrad - but now, for the first time, he appears to have found a little peace of mind. He has actually written a happy ending; the main character, a Vietnam vet, transcends his mental prison and finds the road to redemption.\nThis is no small literary event; as Caputo puts it, \"the other books ended as horrifying downers, with no redemption in any way.\" Now 46 and twice divorced, Caputo was known as a guy who would stomp around his house, acting out (and living within) his profane, half-mad characters - men who were often eager to embrace the beasts within them because it felt good to flout the rules.\n\"I pretty much felt the need to get out of that (dark) outlook myself,\" said Caputo, during a visit last week to Bantam, his publisher. \"Maybe I needed to come to terms with something. With that constant drumbeat of despair, you start to wonder, 'Well, if there isn't much hope, and it's all kind of bleak, why don't I just kill myself?' And then you begin to see reasons why you shouldn't. You begin to see what is life-affirming.\"\nFortuitously, Caputo's tale of spiritual renewal arrives at a time when, in his words, \"there's a real subliminal hunger on the part of the American public to make some sense out of what happened (in the war) - to come to terms with it. But coming to terms means recognizing that we're just as capable of committing the kinds of moral evil as the great European colonial powers did in the past, and that we've got to transcend ourselves.\"\nBut he wonders whether Americans are learning this lesson. Right now, he says, there is too much evidence to the contrary. All he has to do is read the papers.\n\"I came out of the war with the perception that people, including myself, were capable of things that I didn't think one could be capable of doing,\" Caputo says. \"I felt certain impulses that were kind of scary. It led me to a perception that human nature was not as fundamentally sound and good as I'd thought previously. I realized that our hold on goodness was rather tenuous, that it was contingent upon the existence of some form of civilization, without which we'd tend to run amok.\"\nLooking back to his youth, he says, the irony is that \"I had a desire to escape civilization, and that's why I went (to Vietnam) - to escape its suffocating restraints. I had kind of an American frontier outlook - to go out into the wilds, because that's where man would really flourish. But that ideal of mine was just turned on its head by Vietnam.\"\nA product of a middle-class Italian family from the Chicago suburbs, Caputo reached manhood during Camelot, when the Kennedy goal was to pay any price and bear any burden. So the lover of romantic poets, the student of theology and metaphysics, the Catholic with the seemingly strong moral compass, became a gung-ho Marine.\nHe was one of the first to land in Vietnam in 1965, and before long \"a callus began to grow around our hearts.\" He became a platoon leader, \"an agent of death.\" His mission was to kill Viet Cong in quantity, to \"stack 'em like cordwood,\" because war was \"a matter of arithmetic.\"\nIn battle he felt elation as well as dread. He commanded a platoon that rampaged through villages, an \"incendiary mob\" that, at one point, murdered two innocent civilians. He was later put on trial for these murders, but a plea bargain was reached and he was reprimanded for minor offenses.\nHe was honorably discharged in 1967, wandered around Spain trying to put his war stories on paper, returned to Chicago, worked as an advertising copywriter, and then joined a suburban newspaper. He missed the \"sheer intensity\" of the war, although by this time he opposed it politically. He thought the United States should get out, although, in his civilian life, ''everything felt kind of bland and dull.\"\nThen the Chicago Tribune hired him, and, after he shared a Pulitzer Prize for a team probe of city voting fraud, the paper sent him overseas - to Rome, then to Beirut, where he was captured by Palestinian guerrillas, then to Saigon for the American debacle in 1975, and again to Beirut, where he was wounded. By this time, his proposal for a Vietnam memoir was making the rounds in New York; while confined to a wheelchair, he learned that he had a publisher.\nA Rumor of War appeared in 1977, when it was trendy for publishers to say that readers didn't care about a lost war. But Caputo's grunts-in-the-paddy perspective won an audience, and books and movies on the war became chic. Caputo quit the Tribune, moved to Key West and began writing novels. Horn of Africa took place in Ethiopia, but its themes were grounded in the war. DelCorso's Gallery featured a photographer obsessed with the horrors of\nVietnam and Beirut.\nHe has been able to live well by writing about death, but there are times when he is not sure the public is getting the right message. Take the Oscar- winning film Platoon, for example. \"The movie has been ballyhooed as an introduction to what 'really' happened, as Vietnam Experience 101,\" he says. ''But it sets up a false metaphor by dividing this platoon into the forces of darkness and the forces of light. Barnes, the bad sergeant, battles archangel Sgt. Elias. Each has his followers, bad versus good. And that's just bull. It didn't happen that way, and it should offend the intelligence of the public.\"\n\"Here was Barnes, with no single redeeming virtue, and he drank whiskey. The 'bad' guys all drank, and the 'good' guys all smoked pot. That was so stupid, just idiotic. The movie is simplistic. It doesn't confront people with the very difficult truth that good and evil exist within a single human breast, that good or evil can be made manifest depending on the circumstances.\"\nHe pauses, thinking back to his war stint. \"You could get a guy who might often be a perfectly ordinary man and suddenly, under extraordinary circumstances, he becomes a terrific hero or he performs a magnanimous act,\" he says. \"Conversely, the same guy could do something brutal and evil within that same moral and geographical wilderness.\"\nCaputo shrugs. \"But hey,\" he says, \"Oliver Stone is a filmmaker. . . . That's why the public needs literature more than ever. It's the function of literature to explore these complexities. Unfortunately, the country seems to be getting more subliterate.\"\nCaputo denies that he writes about war because he wants to relive it or to\nsomehow purge himself. \"I lived for that intensity,\" he acknowledges, \"for the camaraderie, the sheer intensity of the experience, and I do think there still is some residue of that, some impulse toward the extraordinary. But now I'm getting a little too old for that. You'd have to have a shrink interview me, to say whether there's been some therapy involved. But I don't think so. I think of myself as a professional, and that takes mental discipline.\"\nCaputo is big on personal tests. His hitch in Vietnam taught him to distrust opinionated people whose views have not been challenged, people who think and act without having searched their conscience. To Caputo, both the Iran-contra scandal and the Ivan Boesky flap on Wall Street stem from \"a cowboy mentality very much in the American character, very much rooted in the desire to escape rules and regulations, to do whatever the hell you want. People get a particular end in mind that they think is so overwhelmingly necessary that they do almost anything to further it.\"\nThe arming of the contras, he says, is symptomatic of the fact that \"we still have this image of ourselves as an idealistic and visionary people, and it's not easy for us to accept the dark side of our character. As the Soviet Union is now, can be just as true of us, because we're just as capable of doing (harm) as any other nation in the past.\"\nBut Vietnam, he says, was more than just a foreign war; it was an indictment of certain American values that Caputo deplores - the quest for success at all costs, the reliance on \"technocratic rationalism that becomes irrational.\" In Indian Country, Vietnam vet Chris Starkmann serves as a metaphor for a nation in the throes of a spiritual crisis. We are a nation of lonely people, Caputo says, isolated from one another by selfishness, by a desire to flout the rules that should bind us together.\nHe sees a need in this nation for spiritual (as opposed to religious) renewal, much like the one Chris Starkmann finally achieves - \"a return,\" he says, \"to a form of piety, a recognition that we are all creatures of God, creatures of a higher power, and we owe something to each other and to our human race. Because when we liberate ourselves from what makes us human, we become monsters.\n\"I saw a lot of that with the guys in Vietnam - a recognition that if one can commit certain acts that are utterly reprehensible, it can give you a hideous but very attractive freedom, and suddenly you can snip all the bonds to what you once were. There is this inner voice, though, that can always tell you when something is morally evil. The voice was there for me, but I just failed to listen to it. The lust for blood can become so powerful that even though something is telling you 'this is a monstrosity,' it doesn't matter.\n\"You just have to learn to listen to that inner voice.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:c9afa4d1-ce97-41eb-8d54-02810d022af5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.philly.com/1987-05-20/news/26162254_1_hemingway-and-conrad-indian-country-philip-caputo", "date": "2013-05-18T06:00:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.984187662601471, "token_count": 2308, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "In the basement studio of Crumb's home in Media (where he barricades himself away from the six household dogs), you can pick up a cylinder resembling a sawed-off mailing tube, pull the string hanging out of the bottom, and hear the sound of a cavernous exhalation. It's typical of Crumb's otherworldly ominousness, heard most famously in his settings of Garcia Lorca poems, titled Ancient Voices of Children.\nAs with his six previous songbooks, the new one builds phantasmagorical sound environments around hymns, spirituals, and folk songs, many of which he heard during his upbringing in Charleston, W.Va. His daughter, Ann Crumb, is again a featured soloist, along with baritone Patrick Mason. Though the huge battery of percussion is used with spare precision - there are only four players - the voices have to be amplified, especially in passages inspired by the flocks of crows in the composer's backyard.\nCrumb flips through the score: \"Here I use a low-pitch siren. It's in a very soft range, like a disembodied human voice. Here's the African-Brazilian berimbau,\" a stringed instrument that makes a buzzing sound. \"I knew about it long ago. A percussionist found the crazy thing and I thought of a way to use it. . . . \"\nThough Philadelphia has surprisingly extensive percussion rental agencies, baritone Mason is bringing American Indian rattles in from Boulder, Colo., where he lives. One new feature of Voices From the Heartland is the presence of Navajo and Pawnee chants, the words of which are similar in tone to the Chinese poems Gustav Mahler used in his Das Lied von der Erde.\nHow Crumb came to do this is hard to say: His process is too intuitive for self-analysis. \"I hardly know any facts about the construction of my music,\" he says. \"I'm sure there is some rational process involved. . . . \"\nCertainly, he's remarkably easygoing about how his music is reincarnated. At last year's Ojai Festival in California, director Peter Sellars staged one of Crumb's songbooks, a collection of Civil War songs titled The Winds of Destiny, with soprano Dawn Upshaw costumed as a traumatized Afghan-war veteran.\nHasn't he ever been curious to analyze what's really going on in his music? Though he was on the University of Pennsylvania faculty for more than three decades - analyzing scores by students such as Osvaldo Golijov and Jennifer Higdon - Crumb won't consider subjecting his own music to that kind of scrutiny.\n\"That's a form of suicide. If you get too analytical about your music, it becomes more like a textbook illustration. . . . something that looks good on a blackboard,\" he said, citing Paul Hindemith as an example.\nCrumb does take a certain delight in how his music looks on the page. He loves inventing new time signatures that look like hieroglyphics. In years past, his manuscripts have sometimes come in different colors of ink. An eccentricity? An aesthetic priority? Whatever the case, Crumb has turned out to be a durable survivor of the American avant-garde, perhaps because he was never really a part of it.\nSuch now-deceased contemporaries as Milton Babbitt spent the 1960s producing ever more tightly controlled music with scores that looked more like complicated blueprints. John Cage went to the extreme opposite by declaring that even silence was music. Crumb crafted a sound world of his own with what are often called \"extended techniques\" - drawing unusual sounds out of conventional instruments and then moving on to unconventional instruments.\nThe impracticalities of such pieces only temporarily deterred their performance. His string quartet Black Angels, in which players shout and play tuned water glasses, inspired the formation of the Kronos Quartet - one sign of the lasting recognition that composers often don't have until after they're dead.\nYet for a decade or so, Crumb's compositional life seemed not to survive his fame. Throughout much of the 1990s, he was silent. The rumor in new-music circles was that he had had to give up his multi-pack-a-day smoking habit, and that that had somehow derailed his intuitive gifts. Typically, Crumb won't say anything definite on the subject. But he does quote Alban Berg, who supposed asked a prospective student, \"How can you compose if you don't smoke?\"\nUltimately, nothing truly excited him until his daughter, Ann - who has starred in several Broadway shows and will head the cast of Media Theatre's production of Wings - suggested he write a piece based on folk songs. The silence was broken in 2002 with the first of his songbooks, Unto the Hills, which had her singing \"I am a poor wayfaring stranger\" amid percussive explosions that suggested the song's protagonist was navigating land mines.\nCrumb routinely claims the latest songbook is his last, but often he has a few outtakes from the \"last\" piece, and they grow into the next one. Any future pieces, he says this time, will involve returning to Lorca.\nWhen that happens, Orchestra 2001 is likely to be the first to know - since Swarthmore-based founder/music director James Freeman has been a close collaborator with Crumb (along with Bridge Records, which records the new pieces soon after the premieres). Though Crumb's orchestral works have been performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, Freeman assures the composer that he need not settle for secondhand sounds.\n\"And it's so handy,\" the composer muses. \"Only five miles down the road!\"\nOrchestra 2001 performs\nat 8 p.m. Saturday at Trinity Center in Philadelphia and at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Lang Concert Hall, Swarthmore College. www.orchestra2001.org or 215-893-1999.\nContact music critic David Patrick Stearns at firstname.lastname@example.org.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5e6f8a63-3d32-49d8-bc4b-65eed2e0f23b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.philly.com/2012-01-24/news/30659551_1_george-crumb-ancient-voices-percussion", "date": "2013-05-18T05:32:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.975483238697052, "token_count": 1264, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "SOUTH BEND -- Is there such a thing as too much Darius?

Darius Walker had a career-high 116 yards on 26 carries in his most recent outing, a 44-41 overtime loss to Michigan State Saturday. He also had five catches for 24 yards and a TD in that game. \"I think Darius could run the ball in a game 40 times if you wanted him to, but you have to worry about the whole season,\" said ND head coach Charlie Weis, whose 16th-ranked Irish (2-1) visit Washington (1-2) Saturday. \"I wouldn't be very smart if I gave him the ball too many times in any game, because I want the kid to last the whole season. \"I've seen too many good running backs get worn out early in the year and have no gas in their tank at the end of the year.

{"text": "Rookie Steve David has been exciting powerboat fans since June 5, when he drove Pocket Savers Plus to fourth place in the Budweiser Unlimited Hydroplane Regatta at Miami Marine Stadium.\nThree months and six races later, David is no less impressive, though he has no victories.\nFrom Miami to Madison, Ind., and from Syracuse to Seattle, he has shown he intends to be among the sport`s superstars someday. He says he is pacing himself, and his ultimate goal is to vie for Driver of the Year.\nDavid`s first-year goals are less lofty. He wants to qualify, compete in the finals and finish in the money in every race. He has been successful five of seven times.\nStardom, as he obtained during 10 years of racing smaller limited hydroplanes, can wait.\nThe two times David failed to reach the finals were not his fault. He was clipped from behind in one race, and Pocket Savers Plus blew a piston in another.\n``Steve has an upbeat personality. He also has the talent it takes to do well,`` said Don Jones, American Power Boat Association hydroplane vice president and commissioner of the Seattle-based Unlimited Racing Commission.\nJones said if the vote were today, David would be a cinch to win Rookie of the Year. And David, 34, a real estate agent from Pompano Beach, would love nothing more.\nRookie of the Year status won`t be official until David competes in the final two unlimited races at San Diego and Las Vegas. But he already has a comfortable lead over the sport`s other two rookies: Larry Lauterbach of Portsmouth, Va., and Wheeler Baker of Chester, Md.\nThrough the Budweiser Cup in Seattle, David was in sixth out of 19 places in the American Hydroplane Series URC standings with 3,330 points. David leads Lauterbach by 684 points. Baker has yet to score a point.\nIn the last two races, David will have to race aboard a different boat than the one he has used all season. The original Pocket Savers Plus sustained damage to 70 percent of its hull when the warehouse it was stored in at Owensboro, Ky., caught fire three weeks ago.\n``The funny thing about it is that we`re leasing another boat to finish out the season and it`s faster than the one we`ve been using, so we should do even better,`` David said.\nThe newer boat, leased by the Fred Leland racing team from Seattle, has two Rolls Royce engines.\nDavid`s top finishes were fourth overall in Miami and fourth at the APBA Gold Cup in Evansville, Ind., June 26.\nIn Miami, David reached the finals by default when favorites and top qualifiers Jim Kropfeld in Miss Budweiser and Scott Pierce in Mr. Pringles withdrew because of an accident.\nPierce has since resumed racing. Kropfeld sustained neck and back injuries serious enough to keep him sidelined until next summer.\nDavid paid his dues to get to the unlimited circuit. He started racing 1- and 7-liter limited hydroplanes at 24.\n``I don`t consider limited racing the minor leagues,`` David said. ``Limiteds are just a different class of boat. You need a lot of the same skills. In a lot of places they get just as much respect as the unlimiteds.``\nDavid`s record in limited races enticed owners Jim McCormick and Bob Fendler to choose him as driver for Pocket Savers Plus.\nDavid still races limited boats. On July 10, he won the 1-Liter Stock Hydroplane World Championships. Last August he placed second in the APBA 7- Liter National Championships in Miami.\n``Of course moving up to the unlimited circuit is something every driver dreams about, but I still get a kick out of driving the smaller boats,`` David said. ``There`s only a few unlimited drivers out there, so I`m happy to be among them.``\nPocket Savers Plus is seventh of 18 unlimiteds. Miss Budweiser (6,721), which Tom D`Eath drove to victory during the last three series races, is top boat, followed by Mr. Pringles (6,169).\nDavid will race this weekend in San Diego at the Miller High Life Thunderboat Regatta. The final race is the Las Vegas Silver Cup Sept. 22-24.\n``We`re doing better than we expected,`` David said. ``It`s been a fun summer.``\n-- The Marine Fisheries Commission will hold two workshops in South Florida this week to receive public testimony on a proposal to set the maximum number of tarpon tags to be issued for 1989 at 10,000, with 5,000 reserved for licensed professional guides.

{"text": "Discrimination against citizens because of their sexual orientation or their youth is just as unfair as discrimination based on race, religion or gender. Access to housing, hotels, theaters and restaurants should be equal to all, as a matter of plain fairness.\nThe Palm Beach County Commission recognized this truth in passing an ordinance protecting homosexuals, unmarried couples and young people from discrimination in renting or buying housing and in public accommodations. The ordinance also bans discrimination based on race, religion, gender, ethnic origin or disability, but it was the protection of gays that generated opposition and demands for a countywide referendum on the issue.\nNo other Florida county protects homosexuals against housing discrimination. In the 1970s, Dade County passed a similar ordinance but it was repealed in a voter referendum after a bitter fight.\nA Broward County effort to revise the human rights law to protect homosexuals is more complicated. The Broward law was adopted through the Florida Legislature, so a revision must get legislative approval and be ratified in a public referendum.\nPalm Beach County`s ordinance passed 4-1; commissioner Ron Howard dissented. The other four commissioners demonstrated courage by refusing to buckle under to opponents or to pass the buck to the public in a referendum. Commissioners were elected to make tough decisions; this time they did.\nThe ordinance provides exceptions: A landlord who lives on his property of four or fewer housing units and rents the rest won`t have to comply. Nor will a seasonal resident who rents his home to someone else part of the year and lives in it himself the rest of the time. Also exempt are religious organizations that own housing units.\nThose sensible exceptions leave the vast majority of housing covered under the new ordinance. Violators will face fines of up to $50,000, but it may be difficult to prove a violation. Early decisive action against violators by law enforcers, prosecutors and judges could make a clear statement that the county means business and won`t tolerate further discrimination in housing and public accommodations.", "id": "<urn:uuid:04a92c65-e194-4b3c-ae6e-d4a7b6b1631d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-01-19/news/9001190945_1_ordinance-public-accommodations-housing", "date": "2013-05-18T08:13:40Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9598913788795471, "token_count": 402, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Nikhil Agarwal uses his mobile phone to search Google maps more than to make calls. The 29-year-old marketing professional has to travel extensively in the course of his job and needs to find his way around strange cities and unknown towns. For Nikhil, the map in his palm is a blessing. He says this was why he upgraded to a GPS-enabled mobile. He knew it would simplify life.\nNikhil's experience illustrates a truth now universally acknowledged. A mobile phone is no longer merely a portable alternative to a landline. It can have so much more. Reasonably priced feature-rich handsets may have qwerty keypads, wider screens, touch interfaces. The mobile is increasingly becoming the multi-tasking workhorse of the 21st century:\nenabling the user to surf the net, access emails, get directions, shop or stay in touch with friends on social networking sites.\nAccording to Opera, a popular mobile web browser, page viewing on Indian mobiles has grown 322% from May 2009. It says the number of unique users has grown 324% in the same period. That's not surprising, considering Vinay Goel, Google India products' head, says, that \"the number of mobile users in India with data plans (that allow you to use the internet) has increased 10-fold, from 2.5 million to 25 million in the last two years.\"\nGoel says that almost all phones sold in India today are GPRS-enabled. GPRS or General Packet Radio Service, allows internet access at speeds of anywhere between 56 and 114 kbps. \"Besides the 25 million data plan users, there are an additional 70-80 million using GPRS-enabled phones to download operator applications like ring-tones and wallpapers,\" he says. But the phone is handy in other ways too.\nBOOK TICKETS: Thulasidaran M, a Bangalore-based tech writer, confesses he has quite forgotten the long queues he stood in for years at railway reservation counters. Today, he uses his mobile to book tickets on the Indian Railways website. \"I can even book my tickets while travelling,\" he says.\nHOME SHOPPING: Then there is the shopping. Mobile purchasing is still a nascent phenomenon, but it is undoubtedly catching on. The mall has literally come to your phone as companies tie-up with stores, allowing you to buy almost anything from the comfort of your home. There are a slew of players – Ngpay, mChek, Obopay, Atom Technologies, Paymate – that enable the purchase of airline, railway, bus and movie tickets, pay utility bills and insurance premiums and make hotel bookings.\nTUNE IN: The mobile has also put music at everyone's fingertips. Shubha C S works at Bengaluru International Airport and says FM radio is a boon. \"I spend three hours travelling daily. The only time I relax is when I shut my eyes and\nlisten to music on my mobile,\" she says.\nMOTHER'S HELP: The mobile has become an extraordinary help for the harassed mother. Geetanjali S says she regularly searches the mobile's web browser for new games to amuse her six-year-old. \"When his friends are not around to play, he throws a tantrum. He is bored of the games I have on my mobile. So I keep finding new ones,\" she explains.\nCHEAP INTERNET: Mobile internet has become fairly affordable, with costs coming down almost 300% over the last couple of years. Goel says that Aircel's monthly internet plan for Rs 95 triggered a revolution. \"India is now among the top five countries for data traffic. Data plans here are cheaper than anywhere else. And only a tiny fraction of internet traffic is through high-end phones.\"\nNow, Airtel offers internet vouchers starting at just Rs 7. \"I was surprised when the 15-year-old son of a farmer in Dharwad told me that he uses his pocket money (Rs 100) for phone internet. The cost has influenced rural penetration too,\" says Venkatesh V, CEO of mobile services for Bharti Airtel's Karnataka operations.\nBSNL has made it still more attractive. \"Customers purchasing a 3G data card from BSNL are given free data usage of 6 GB per month,\" says D M Ezhil Buddhan, director (southern region) in the Department of Telecommunications. 3G will further marginalize voice on the mobile phone, given the extremely high internet speeds it promises. Already, BSNL 3G offers TV on the cellphone. Videos will catch on too.\nUnsurprisingly, app stores have become treasure troves. There are more than 2.25 lakh apps in the iPhone store and 60,000 in Google's Android store. Some are severely useful, helping track daily calorie intake. Some are fairly barmy, reproducing, say, the moo of a cow (Hello Cow) or tricking people into believing your phone can detect smells (Smell Scanner).\nNow, Indian telecom operators are creating their own app stores. When Bharti Airtel opened its mobile application store – Airtel App Central – earlier this year, it clocked over 2.5 m downloads in just one month. \"Now, we have over 1,500 apps for downloads and these are as low as Re 1 per day,\" says Venkatesh of Bharti Airtel. The apps range across 25 categories, including business, games, books and social networking.\nThe future seems bright. Micromax has introduced phones that double up as a remote for the TV, DVD and AC. Texas Instruments has helped build what is called a DLP Pico projector into cellphones, which allows one to take a picture or a video and share them instantly on any surface that can take a big projected image.\nIn short, that little device in your hand is becoming the way to achieve almost anything and everything.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e919f8e9-b0cc-45ea-8c4e-79269c8ca389>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-22/telecom/28321253_1_mobile-phone-gprs-enabled-phones-vinay-goel", "date": "2013-05-18T06:46:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9650413990020752, "token_count": 1245, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "24/7 culture, autogenic training, befriend, brainstorming, change, condition, get worse, grieving process, heal, insomnia, lavander, patterns, recharge your battery, rhythms, shiatsu, silence, sleep tight, sleeplessness, speep problem\nIt’s funny how little things can throw us off course. Our body gets so used to its rhythms and patterns that any changes to our daily routine can have a big impact. I really noticed the phenomenon after the clocks went back at the weekend. Just the difference of an hour can affect how we sleep, and our feelings about ourselves as a result.\nSleep problems are increasingly common, thanks to the hectic pace of life today, and the 24/7 culture that expects us to be available whenever, wherever. There are some sleep problems that are largely unavoidable, such as the fatigue associated with parenting babies and small children, nighttime shift work and international travel. But many people still struggle to drop off and sleep soundly, even without intervening factors.\nIt was problems with sleeping that led me to discover Autogenic Training (AT) in 2004. Despite the severity of my insomnia, it disappeared in a few short weeks as I learned how to take my body and mind into a deeply relaxed state. About a year later I began to experience sleeping difficulties again, and was worried that I had relapsed, or that the AT had somehow ‘worn off’.\nHowever, I was reassured to discover that it was just another layer of my development, and that I had several more to go in order to help my body and mind to truly heal. A few things I learned from that experience were:\n- It takes time to develop a condition, and will take some time (but not as long) to heal it. There is no quick fix, whatever we might like to believe.\n- It can help to befriend your condition, rather than view it as an enemy. This will help you to understand what it needs.\n- Things might temporarily get worse before they get better, as if to remind you of your problem’s existence before you can let it go.\n- Your condition might flare up again from time to time, but less severely and for shorter periods. This is all part of the healing process.\nOne of my clients had suffered from insomnia for 50 years, but after five weeks of AT training could sleep for five hours instead of the usual two to three.\nAnother client admits that he does his best business brainstorming when he’s not able to sleep. He actually enjoys these creative times. I’ve observed this with other people too – we may experience a condition for years and wish to change it, but on another level we’re kind of attached to it. We actually need to go through a grieving process and say goodbye to the nights when we enjoyed the silence and mystery of the darkness.\nYou may also find you buy into the ‘romance’ of insomnia, or the competitive sleeplessness that pervades our society. People often boast about working into the small hours and still hitting the gym at 6am. Margaret Thatcher was well known not only for surviving but thriving on four hours’ sleep a night. It’s important if you do hold some positive’ associations with insomnia, that you let them go so you can truly relax.\nSleeplessness should not become a lifestyle.\nHowever you choose to treat your condition, it’s important to regularly recharge your battery. I’ve written about the importance of ‘me time’ in a previous post , and that you enjoy what you are doing. Autogenic Training (AT) has been proven to help with insomnia. If you would like to come for a trial session, please get in touch. Anyone can learn AT. It’s simple, you can practise it anywhere, and the results can be life-changing. You’ve nothing to lose but your insomnia.", "id": "<urn:uuid:13bff664-399a-41e8-b5e9-430a28bd9c19>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://artofrelaxation.org/tag/lavander/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:55:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9683902859687805, "token_count": 816, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "I apologize in advance for how long this is but I need to explain and I need help!\nSo last Monday was the first week at school for students... Wednesday morning, I get my class schedule and see that there are two teachers' names in one class slot. I kept looking at it thinking that surely I must not be understanding it correctly. I started to ask another teacher and then saw my principal. I asked him about it and he said that since we had to add another Kindergarten class this year due to a large enrollment (now 7 classes of 18 students,) the only way to fit them all in the schedule was to send two Kindergarten classes to art at once, 36 students! My jaw literally dropped for like the second time in my life. It took me a minute to process and then I asked where I was supposed to put them! (I currently have room for 24 students.) After talking with my principal and both of us trying to come up with other solutions, he said we could go to the cafeteria and he would get someone to help me. I talked to him today and one of the Paras is going to help with that section. I said that was certainly better than 36 five year olds in my classroom with just me, but I am still really stressed out about it!\nI just feel bad, like those students won't get the same experience as the others. For example, I use my classroom projector ALL THE TIME to teach the art history inspiring some of the projects that I don't have posters for.

Add the dry ingredients to the batter in three additions on low speed, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.\nDivide the batter among the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges clean, 55-65 minutes. Cool the layers for 15 in the pans, and then carefully invert them onto wire racks to cool completely.\nAnd now, you make the frosting. I chose a recipe found here, at The Way the Cookie Crumbles – recipe #2,\nVanilla Buttercream (from epicurious.com and Gourmet January 2004)\nMakes about 6 cups. (I might have made 1.5 batches for better coverage)\n4 large egg whites at room temperature for 30 minutes\nRounded ¼ teaspoon salt\n2/3 cup water\n1 1/3 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar\n4 sticks (2 cups) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon pieces and softened (next time, I might use only 3 sticks)\n2 teaspoons vanilla\nCombine whites and salt in a very large bowl. Stir together water and 1 1/3 cups sugar in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan until sugar is dissolved, then bring to a boil over moderate heat, without stirring, brushing any sugar crystals down side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in water.\nWhen syrup reaches a boil, start beating egg whites with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until frothy, then gradually add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat at medium speed until whites just hold soft peaks (looks kind of like soap foam). (Do not beat again until sugar syrup is ready.)\nMeanwhile, put thermometer into sugar syrup and continue boiling until syrup registers 238 to 242°F. Immediately remove from heat and, with mixer at high speed, slowly pour hot syrup in a thin stream down side of bowl into whites, beating constantly. Beat, scraping down side of bowl with a rubber spatula, until meringue is cool to the touch, about 10 minutes in a standing mixer or 15 with a handheld. (It is important that meringue is properly cooled before proceeding.)\nWith mixer at medium speed, gradually add butter 1 piece at a time, beating well after each addition until incorporated. (Buttercream will look soupy after some butter is added if meringue is still warm. If so, briefly chill bottom of bowl in a large bowl filled with ice water for a few seconds before continuing to beat in remaining butter.) Continue beating until buttercream is smooth. (Mixture may look curdled before all of butter is added but will come back together by the time beating is finished.) Add vanilla and beat 1 minute more.\nAt this point, if you’ve planned well, you can immediately frost the cooled layers.\nI, of course, did not plan well. It was late at night on a workday, the cake was too warm to frost, and I wasn’t about to stay up. So I put the frosting in the fridge overnight. Moderate mistake – it didn’t change the flavor, but the texture and volume changed. So. FYI.\nFrost the cake – layer cake, frosting, layer cake, frosting, layer cake, and frost everything. Another half batch of frosting would’ve covered the messiness that results from white frosting on a chocolate cake, but then everything might’ve been too rich.\nNow, you slice and eat.\nThis is a very rich cake – eat in small pieces. Freezes and refrigerates well, too. It will be made again.\nTomorrow: the best and only mac and cheese recipe you’ll ever need again.", "id": "<urn:uuid:38c8726c-5a2d-4b48-b810-ac3686f4cb51>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ashinwi.wordpress.com/2010/01/16/tims-birthday-cake-2010/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:08:26Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9207051992416382, "token_count": 1110, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "This is a quick post, not the one on leaky gut syndrome that I promised you! That is not finished yet. This is just to show how ridiculous the lives of chronically ill people can be! It is no wonder I get so little done in a day and am mentally exhausted! This stuff takes a lot of concentration…\nI have started taking digestive enzymes recently as described in my previous post. I have added a high protease (systemic) enzyme to take between meals (to allegedly reduce bodily inflammation and pain among other things). I have also started taking L-Glutamine (though I suspect it has caused diarrhea so I have paused for now to test that, but let’s assume I am taking it. I also read that drinking fluids should be avoided so as not to dilute the enzymes in their very important work, and that if you have low stomach acid the dilution is not good (I don’t know if this applies to me but it could and seems likely) so I should not drink for an hour before meals or two hours afterwards. The protease enzyme is the same rules, but only half an hour before meals is ok. I also take an anti-spasmodic and other medications not related to my digestive issues. I also have in the fridge two probiotics which I plan to start taking soon. I generally need to drink about 4 litres of fluids per day (that’s up to 4x what people usually drink unless it’s hot weather) to help with POTS symptoms.\nSo let’s see what a day looks like if I do this properly:\n8.30am wake up and take my usual medications with water (most of my glasses of water and cups of tea are 1/3 litre).\n9am Get up and have a cup of tea. Take vitamins including zinc (good for digestive/gut health). I really should take more vitamin C too – note to self – it apparently helps kill bad bugs in the gut.\nAlso put Alpha Stim electrodes on my upper back as I do every day (my pain relief machine).\n9.30am take antispasmodic and L-Glutamine\n9.45 take digestive enzyme (as it is a veggie capsule I read it needs time to dissolve so to take it a bit before eating, but other places say to take at the same time as food, so I am confused about this one. Let’s say 15 mins is ok for now.\n10am take probiotic (type one) and eat breakfast\nAlso move electrodes on Alpha Stim to anywhere else that hurts or just to another position for upper back/shoulders.\n11am change setting on Alpha Stim to CES and put earclips on\n12 midday take systemic enzyme and wait half an hour for it to get into my system (think this way round makes sense or I would drink then have to wait an hour?)\nAlpha Stim done.\n12.30 take usual medications and push fluids for half an hour, perhaps 1 litre.\n1pm stop drinking and wait an hour before food\n1.30 take antispasmodic and L-Glutamine\n1.45 take digestive enzyme assuming it takes time to dissolve\n2 – 2.30pm take probiotic (type one) and eat lunch\nGo to bed and rest/nap\n4.30 wake up and take systemic enzyme\n5-5.30pm take usual medications and drink fluids – 1 litre\n6pm take antispasmodic and L-Glutamine\n6.15 take digestive enzyme\n6.30-7pm take probiotic (type one) and eat\n9pm drink – not much as getting late and don’t want to be up all night – 1/3 litre\n10pm – take usual medications and probiotic (type two). Make way to bed.\nSo I have only managed to fit in 3 litres of fluids, plus a bit with tablets. I could take a jug and drink more before getting up. This regime also prevents me eating little and often as I prefer and forces me to make sure I have eaten enough in one sitting to last me 4 1/2 hours. This goes against advice for managing IBS and POTS symptoms. I also really like to finish a meal with a cup of tea, but I have known for a long time this is not meant to be good if you have digestive issues.\nI have tried the systemic enzyme for a few days and that was fine although my stomach seemed to be getting more sore each morning so I am resting it before starting again as is advised. I am unsure about the L-Glutamine but will try it again in a few days. My plan is to do this properly in a couple of weeks and go sugar-free for that time to see if I get any symptoms of die-off to test for a yeast overgrowth. If I feel fine (normal for me!) than it suggests that yeast is not a big issue for me. The more I read about Leaky Gut Syndrome I suspect it may be an issue, despite being quite skeptical, but I think not too extreme for me. I hope so anyway. Even if I cut out all sugars I will still have to eat the diet that I can currently digest which is not very low GI so there will be sugars present (rice/potato) but it will be reduced and that should trigger some reaction. I think taking the probiotics at this time will maximise their efficacy as the bad bugs will be dying anyway - ha ha evil laugh.\nSomeone had generously given me some Stevia to use during my sugar-free fortnight. My plan is to make some chocolate biscotti (I have found a recipe) so that I can end meals with something sweet and also sweeten my breakfast as I will have to switch to unsweetened soya milk (yuk!).\nSorry for the lack of links in this post – I really have no energy/time for it. Please leave a comment if anything is unclear – my next post on Leaky Gut Syndrome (coming in a week or two) should clarify it all anyway!\n*I do not advise anyone to undertake this strange regmen, I know not how useful it will be, only using myself as a guinea pig, as usual…", "id": "<urn:uuid:ae0a4257-9256-4a92-b78d-0ac4c66c5c17>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ashy00.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/too-many-time-constraints/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:56:37Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9687758088111877, "token_count": 1305, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "China's Africa Strategy\nChina's Africa Strategy\nChina's Rise Series\nNEW YORK - In its effort to secure oil and other resources, China has set its sights on Africa, increasingly attracting the world’s attention. While state-owned companies sought out exploration and supply contracts, Beijing courted African governments with trade, investment, debt reduction, and aid packages. There are strongly divergent viewpoints on how this economic diplomacy has impacted China’s efforts to promote a positive image abroad, and what the overall impact of China’s strategy has been on the African continent.\nOn May 5, three experts came to the Asia Society to share their thoughts on this issue. With a range of both complementary and opposing viewpoints, one thing was certain: the effects of China’s Africa strategy are not black and white.\nStephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, China and North East Asia project director at the International Crisis Group, noted that China’s role could be both positive and negative in Africa, but that “China’s investment puts the ball in Africa’s court”; in other words, it is up to African leaders and corporations to take proper advantage of China’s capital and resources. Harry Broadman, economic adviser for the Africa Region at the World Bank, concurred, admitting that a lack of national leadership in Africa made it difficult to take advantage of China’s unconditional investment strategy. Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies and a former vice president at the CNOOC, was more defensive of China’s investments and position of non-interference. At one point, he noted that the CNOOC had not invested in Africa until the Unicom deal was derailed by US protectionism, complaining that the West cannot “have your cake and eat it too.”\nDespite differences in the overall effect of China’s investment, there was consensus that China’s approach to investment—unconditional, and frequently including human capital training, infrastructure development, and worker benefits—had successfully wooed African corporations and governments. However, China may have to transform its strategy as Africa develops a stronger consumer culture and civil society.\nExcerpt: Why is China grateful to African nations?

The attic water heater started raining water into the bathroom below yesterday so we decided it was probably time to get a new one. Now the guy installing it tells me that in addition to the $299 installation fee, I also need to install flexible piping ($60) and that the water pressure coming into my house is too high and that they need to install a new water pressure valve for $199. I think they're ripping me off - I can understand the need for the new piping because the current water heater is connected with rigid copper piping, but I already bought an expansion kit to go with the water heater that I thought controlled the water pressure coming into the water heater. So do I really need to change the water pressure for the whole house?

{"text": "We've all heard it and we all love it, but what exactly is Gangnam Style and what makes it so popular in your opinion?\nThe Korean tried. He really tried to avoid the fad. He thought this was going to blow over in a few days, and everyone will feel a bit silly afterward. But no . . .\nGangnam Style just kept coming on -- 273 million views and counting, appearances on network televisions shows, continuous climb up the charts and numerous homages to the original. (The latest one: from the Ohio University marching band.) Questions about Gangnam Style just kept coming also, even though the Korean has been slower with blog updates.\nSo, FINE. Let's discuss Gangnam Style. First, what exactly is \"Gangnam Style\"? \"Gangnam\" literally means \"south of the river.\" But generally, Gangnam refers to a specific area in Seoul located south of the Han River that bisects the city. The area generally encompasses the northern half of (confusing name alert) Gangnam-gu and Seocho-gu, covering neighborhoods like Apgujeong, Sinsa and (confusing name alert, again) Gangnam. It is an area with posh malls, expensive dining and swanky clubs. People who populate those areas are rich, stylish and beautiful, carrying all the appropriate status symbols like imported cars and fancy handbags. They are often celebrities or heirs of Korea's magnates.\nThe Korean was raised in Apgujeong, so he is the original Gangnam man. And it has been a little bit funny to see his old home described breathlessly as some place that \"has no real equivalent in the United States. The closest approximation would be Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Beverly Hills, Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and Miami Beach all rolled into one[,]\" according to the Wall Street Journal (quoting this clueless blogger.) Finding the U.S. equivalent of Gangnam is quite easy: it's West Hollywood / Beverly Hills. It has celebrities, style, money, and nice homes and good schools just behind those flashing lights.\n(Aside: This \"no equivalent in U.S.\" trope is really overused, and in this instance, the comparison is clearly hyperbolic and incorrect. Gangnam is obviously not a Silicon Valley, since there is no huge concentration of tech companies in Gangnam. Nor is it Wall Street -- that would be Gwanghwamun / City Hall area, north of the river, where all the major banks have their headquarters. Gangnam is not Upper East Side either, since Gangnam is decidedly nouveau riche. The old money of the kind that occupies the Upper East Side of New York is found in Yeonhee-dong of Seoul, north of the river. The Miami Beach comparison is too dumb to address.)\nSo when PSY speaks of \"Gangnam Style,\" he means to invoke the trendy, stylish image. But of course, what PSY ends up doing in the music video is a parody of such image. He is wearing a ridiculous suit and dances a ridiculous dance. He appears in decidedly un-Gangnam areas: children's playground, on a paddle boat, riverside park, a bus with a disco ball, etc. A couple of times, PSY does encounter what might be fairly close to a Gangnam-type occasion -- a man driving a fancy car (a cameo appearance by the legendary comedian Yoo Jae-seok,) and a beautiful woman (cameo by Hyuna from the girl group 4Minute) flirting. But those moments quickly dissolve into another round of ridiculous dancing.\n(Aside: If you immediately understood the relevance of the bus with a disco ball, you have a black belt in Korean culture. The \"party\" bus is usually for older Korean men and women, who would like to dance away from the public view. To release their urges to shake it, they would charter these buses with total strangers and have a mobile dancing session. By the way, those old Korean folks dance about as well as your parents. It is probably the most un-hip mobile party in the world -- which fits perfectly with Gangnam Style's aesthetics.)\nHaving said that, what made Gangnam Style so popular?\n(More after the jump)\nGot a question or a comment for the Korean? Email away at email@example.com.\nAt bottom, Gangnam Style is popular because of the same reasons why any pop music is popular. The song is catchy, the music video is interesting and funny (and full of hot girls to boot,) and the dance is distinctive. (One recent example that replicates this pattern: Teach Me How to Dougie by Cali Swag District.)\nBut of course, there is more to it, since plenty of Korean pop music that never sees the light of the day still satisfy those criteria, even as a lot of Korean pop musicians deliberately market themselves in the U.S. So what made Gangnam Style stand out? Broadly speaking, there are two reasons.\nFirst, Korean pop music has been laying a solid groundwork for PSY to succeed. It is true that, thus far, efforts by Korea's pop stars to break into the U.S. market resulted in a flop. Top stars like Wonder Girls, Girls' Generation and 2NE1 never made a dent on America's public consciousness. Nevertheless, the groundwork that these groups laid remains important. Because Korean pop music at least got on the radar screen of the insider players of American media market, PSY's music was easily accepted by those insiders.\nThis is a crucial point that separates Korean pop music and pop music from other, non-Anglophonic countries. Through repeated contacts with American media, Korean pop music had a ready audience among American media insiders.\n|The Twitter network map that traces the connection between |\nthe first appearance of Gangnam Style and T-Pain,\nfrom a study commissioned by YG Entertainment, PSY's production company\nSecond, Gangnam Style is popular in America because Gangnam Style is familiar to Americans in multiple ways. The song's electro-pop tune fits right in with the current American music trend, in which LMFAO's Sexy and I Know It is one of the favorites. (Try listening to Gangnam Style right after Sexy and I Know It -- the similarities are enough to think that the same person composed both.) Because the tune of the song is so familiar, it matters less that most Americans have no idea what PSY is singing about.\n(Aside: But do not over-interpret this point and think that PSY was copying LMFAO. PSY has been around for 11 years, and he can be heard composing this self-satirical, electro-pop music pretty early on in his career. For example, check out PSY's 2002 song, Champion.)\nSimilarly, it is not enough to say that Gangnam Style is popular in the U.S. because Gangnam Style is hilarious; Gangnam Style is popular in the U.S. because it is hilarious in a way that is familiar to Americans. The code of humor embedded in the music video -- awkwardness punctuated by bouts of ridiculous non-sequitur (like the guy in a cowboy hat doing pelvic thrust, another cameo appearance by comedian Noh Hong-cheol) -- is very common among American comedy. Ultimately, it is the same type of humor latent in, say, Napoleon Dynamite -- an embarrassing train wreck in which the main character is somehow vindicated through sheer obliviousness and irrational self-confidence.\nThere is a dark side of this code of humor as well. In the current day American pop culture, it is ok to laugh at Asians doing strange things. (Think Ken Jeong's character in the Hangover series.) On a certain level, PSY -- a pudgy, funnily-dressed Korean man -- is a comfortable target to laugh at. This is not to say that people who enjoy Gangnam Style all have a sinister, racist motive. This is only to say that people's motives as they approach a certain phenomenon are complex and multitudinous, and not all of them are necessarily positive.\nThere are certain occasions in which such non-positive motives reveal themselves in a really ugly way. In the Creators' Project concert held in Seoul a few days ago, Korean rap legend Drunken Tiger took the stage. According to Tiger JK, leader of Drunken Tiger, the \"white people\" toward the front of the stage hollered their demands that Drunken Tiger do PSY's horse dance. This led to an angry tirade from Tiger JK: \"Just cuz I don’t dance when i spit. Don’t mean I’m frontin. I salute my homie PSY success.But I don’t have to dance for you cuz I’m Asian.\" In the hands of ignorant people, Gangnam Style will become the new \"ching chong.\"\nA few leftover thoughts about Gangnam Style, and the attention surrounding it:\n1. While the Korean is quite happy that PSY's music is receiving international attention, he cannot believe the ridiculousness of the commentary surrounding this piece. In fact, reading the commentary regarding Gangnam Style was a good way of finding out who knows what he was talking about, and who is simply full of shit.\nThe most frequent type of ridiculousness has been over-analysis. People who otherwise knew little about Korea hung onto every little bit of Gangnam Style, and interpreted every aspect of it as if Gangnam Style were the Bible. The worst offender of this was The Atlantic article on Gangnam Style, which had this gem:\nOne of the first things Hong pointed to in explaining the video's subtext was, believe it or not, South Korea's sky-high credit card debt rate. In 2010, the average household carried credit card debt worth a staggering 155 percent of their disposable income (for comparison, the U.S. average just before the sub-prime crisis was 138 percent). There are nearly five credit cards for every adult. South Koreans have been living on credit since the mid-1990s, first because their country's amazing growth made borrowing seem safe, and then in the late 1990s when the government encouraged private spending to climb out of the Asian financial crisis. The emphasis on heavy spending, coupled with the country's truly astounding, two-generation growth from agrarian poverty to economic powerhouse, have engendered the country with an emphasis on hard work and on aspirationalism, as well as the materialism that can sometimes follow.\nGangnam, Hong said, is a symbol of that aspect of South Korean culture.\n2. Another brand of over-analysis: connecting Gangnam Style to some obscure Korean tradition that has very little bearing in modern Korea. This is from the Wall Street Journal article linked earlier:\nPSY belongs to an established genre of entertainers that pop pundits there have dubbed “gwang-dae,” after a caste of performers traditionally attached to royal households. “Gwang-dae are more clown or jester-like,” says Kang. “They don’t have to be sexy idols to be popular. Their songs are either very humorous, or can sound serious, but with silly lyrics.” . . . The original gwang-dae were given a certain amount of license to critique the aristocracy, offering up satirical commentary on society through their dance, music and repartee.\nOr maybe it makes more sense to focus on Korea's robust modern pop music history. Just a suggestion.\n3. It was also refreshing to see the tired old stereotypes about Korea that get trotted out in the commentary. (The Korean tends to miss them sometimes.) Again, from The Atlantic article:\n\"Social commentary is just not really done in mainstream Korean pop music\"?? Anyone with the most basic knowledge of Korea's pop music history knows this is not true. Off the top of his head, the Korean can name several dozen songs by indisputably mainstream, chart-topping K-pop artists that explicitly made social commentaries, often in a satirical manner. As a quick example, this is how a song from 2000 called 포조리 [Pojori], by DJ Doc, begins. (Note that \"dirty bird\" [짭새] is a Korean slang for police):None of this commentary is particularly overt, which is actually what could make \"Gangnam Style\" so subversive. Social commentary is just not really done in mainstream Korean pop music, Hong explained. \"The most they'll do is poke fun at themselves a little bit. It's really been limited.\"\n새가 날아든다 왠갖 짭새가 날아든다So this song, in pretty explicit terms, criticizes Korean police. (And trust me when the Korean says -- the lyrics get worse.) Oh by the way, DJ Doc's album containing this song (which was the second headlining song) topped the sales chart for three weeks. But nooo -- let's quote the guy who clearly has no idea what he is talking about. We cannot possibly ruin the stereotype about how Koreans are these meek, subservient and humorless automatons, can we?\nBirds fly in, all kinds of dirty birds fly in\n새중에 넌 씨방새~ 날지 못하는 새 짭새\nAmong the birds you are a fuckshit bird, a flightless dirty bird\n새가 날아든다 짭새가 날아든다\nBirds fly in, the dirty birds fly in\n문제야 문제 우리나라 경제 좆같은 짭새와 꼰대가 문제\nIt's a problem, it's problem, the economy is a problem, the dickhead dirty birds and the assholes are the problem\n새가 날아든다 짭새가 날아든다\nBirds fly in, the dirty birds fly in\n짭짭짭짭짭짭 짭새가 문제\nD-d-d-d-d-dirty birds are the problem\n4. While the Korean wishes PSY well, he cannot help but wonder if PSY can achieve a sustainable success. Although the Korean laid out several factors for PSY's success, he cannot tell just how much each factor is weighed. If PSY's musical merit is the greater factor, he will find sustained success. But if catchiness plus being an easy target of laughter are the greater factors, Gangnam Style could simply be another Macarena. Although Gangnam Style is undoubtedly a huge success story for Korean pop music in general, the Korean is still waiting for the true, genuine breakthrough of Korean pop music in the United States.\n-EDIT 9/26/2012- The Korean fixed up some sentences here and there to make the post a bit cleaner. Also, this post about the term oppa might be helpful for those who are curious. Before Gangnam Style took off, that post was one of the first Google search results for \"oppa.\"\nGot a question or a comment for the Korean?

{"text": "Alright, so, I’m a fifteen-year-old girl currently doing grade ten. I eat far too much in the way of carbs, but other than that, I’m not too unhealthy. I procrastinate; I’m not the best friend to have due to my laziness; and I’ve never felt like I belonged anywhere.\nMy problem is this: why do I get so utterly furious so often? Sure — teenage girl, raging hormones, blah, blah, blah — but the tiniest things can set me off, then I’m crying and yelling, often with a mixture of utter rage and guilt boiling in my gut. If this were ‘normal’, the world would have torn itself to shreds by now.\nThere is no history of abuse of any kind in my family, no alcoholics, nothing. I can’t be myself around my family, but then again, can anyone? However, with my father sometimes the sound of his voice literally makes me want to hit him. I love him dearly, but he makes me so mad at the tiniest comment, it’s ridiculous!\nIs there anything I can do to control my rage (especially with my father!)?\nOur Clinical Psychologist’s Reply\nYou began your question by mentioning a few things: a tendency to procrastinate, a sense of not fitting in, an idea of yourself as lazy, and the sense that you cannot be yourself with your family. I understand that these are not the issues you are concerned about, but I mention them because I wonder if they contribute to the bigger picture of your mood and reactions.\nProcrastinating can create stress as the deadline approaches. And I wondered if you have gotten negative feedback from peers about being “lazy.” Conflict with peers, feeling as if you do not fit, and feeling as if you cannot be yourself with your family: these things put together seem to me to leave you with few places or people with whom you are at ease or even happy. If academic stress, a lack of satisfying social relationships, and disconnection within your family do not leave you feeling irritable and/or angry, I would be surprised! For teenagers especially, school and friends are two very important arenas that contribute to both how you feel and how you think of yourself. If you are feeling less than successful with friends, as well as with schoolwork, it would make sense to me if this was spilling over into your mood and temper.\nNow, with that said, while it could be these experiences causing you to have a short or intense temper, it may be something else. Without ruling out more concrete medical or mental health causes for your anger and rage, we would not be able to say for sure.\nYou stated that you have not been abused or had to deal with alcoholism in your family. This is good. But I wonder about other ways that your experiences and your family’s mental health history could be playing into what you are experiencing. You did not mention whether mood disorders (such as depression or bipolar disorder) or other mental health problems (such as ADHD or other impulse control disorders) run in your family.\nSo, I have mentioned circumstances as well as biological causes. However, most often it is not either/or. Typically, it is both/and. What I mean is, what is inside you (neurochemistry and hormones) and what is going on outside you (situations and relationships) interact together to cause behavior. For example, if depression runs in your family, you might be predisposed to have a low or irritable mood. This may never occur, but if you were to add in an ongoing stressful situation at school, conflict with friends, or a culture of perfectionism and criticism in your family (just as an example), you might find that depression symptoms are triggered.\nSo, regardless of the cause, you are wondering what you can do to control your temper. Sometimes it can be helpful to identify a pattern with regard to what is making you angry. For example, when your father says X, Y or Z, it really sets you off. If you can start to see how certain kinds of comments he makes or ways that he interacts with you trigger you, then you can consider speaking with him about it. Often in these situations, it is best for people to approach a sensitive topic when they are feeling calm, rather than mentioning it in a moment of anger. For example, one might say, “I’ve noticed that when you comment about X, Y, or Z, I feel really frustrated.” Often when approached calmly, people are willing to discuss ways of changing the problem together.\nHowever, sometimes they are not! Let’s imagine that your father is going to continue to say the things he says that make you mad, no matter what. There are a few strategies you can use in the moment. Deep, abdominal breathing can help your body move from the physical agitation that anger can bring, over to a more relaxed state. Breathe, filling your belly with air, as you count to three. Hold the breath for three counts, and then blow it slowly out as you count to three again. If you do this several times, you might find that you feel more calm. Another anger management technique is to “talk back” to your anger in the moment to avoid acting out in a way that will worsen the problem. For example, you might say something in your head to yourself such as, “I am feeling really angry, but I can wait to say what I need to say.” You can also search online for additional information about anger management for teens.\nIt is absolutely normal to have feelings of irritation, anger, even rage at times. However, if these feelings are beginning to feel like the norm instead of the exception, you might find that speaking to an adult and obtaining help is a next step. For some kids, parents are the first people in whom they want to confide. If you are not comfortable talking to your parents or other family members, your pediatrician or school counselor might be a neutral, safe adult who can offer ideas or point you in a direction to get some help.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f812d5fd-e2d6-4ffc-a808-ad64b2a1c75e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://askthepsych.com/atp/2012/08/01/a-15-year-old-girl-how-can-i-control-my-rage/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:02:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9704811573028564, "token_count": 1291, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Namely:\n- I've tried installing a newer kernel (3.3+), since some people have reported success with it. That didn't seem to fix the resolution problem.\n- I've tried installing an older version of Ubuntu (10.04), since someone suggested there's an older driver that should provide basic support for the card, but the liveCD image wouldn't boot.\n- I've tried using this ppa. On first reboot, the screen resolution was correct. Subsequent reboots lead to a blank screen immediately after grub.\n- I've tried passing the kernel option\nvideo=1024x600with the above PPA, to no avail.\n- I've tried installing a daily build of Quantal. The live image boots with the correct resolution. The installed system boots to a blank screen. The\nvideo=1024x600option doesn't work here either.\n- On Quantal I've blacklisted the\ngma500_gfxdriver to force the use of\nvesa.

{"text": "By Elaine Orr\nFew studies about labor force growth and change have captured the nation’s attention as did the Hudson Institute’s1987 report, Workforce 2000. Part of it was the fascination of a new millennium and our need to examine where we were and where we are going — witness books such as Megatrends and its sequel– and part was the style of Workforce 2000. There was no need for a degree in labor economics to understand it.\nBut the media’s misinterpretation (or at least mis-presentation) of parts of the report also catapulted it to prominence. Headlines blared that by 2000, white men would make up only fifteen percent of the American workforce. In fact, the report said that the number of white men in the workforce would grow more slowly than women or nonwhite men, and white men would comprise approximately fifteen percent of new entrants to the workforce by 2000. This was a big change from the 1950s-1970s, but not unexpected given that society had become less biased about women and African Americans or Hispanics going to college, and baby-boomers were not going to inhabit the one wage-earner world of their parents.\nGovernment and private companies sought a more diverse workforce, and while some complained that there was reverse discrimination, over time the workplace ultimately did what it has always done — employers tried to get the talent needed for the best price. Lately, employers have had quite the pickings.\nIn 2004, the RAND Corporation (for the U.S. Department of Labor) examined what it saw as three major factors that were “expected to shape the world of work in the coming decades: shifting demographic patterns, the pace of technological change, and the path of economic globalization.” It concluded, among other things, that technological advances would continue to increase demand for a highly skilled workforce. The report saw this as one factor that would support higher productivity growth and change the organization of business and the nature of employment relationships.”\nThe Hudson Institute’s Workforce 2020 addressed how companies needed to adapt to an aging workforce and change jobs to accommodate technology changes, and how trends such as telecommuting, temporary staffing, and employee leasing affect the workplace. Boston College’s Sloan Center on Aging and Work issued Engaging the 21st Century Multi-generational Workforce (prepared for Met Life), which examined levels of “employee engagement” and how it might vary by age.\nThe themes of technological change and age were everywhere. College students looked at those studies (or at least articles about them) and considered them as they picked majors. While technology and aging baby boomers continue to resonate in reports about the workforce and potential careers, what no one could have predicted even five years ago was that the Great Recession would make many reports outmoded before they had time to accumulate dust on a library shelf. (A shelf? Don’t you mean the digital files would be corrupted?)\nBaby boomers, who were expected to retire in such droves that there would be excruciating talent shortages, have watched retirement nest eggs shrink and many remained at work — at least those who have kept pace with newer workplace technologies. However, those same boomers paid for the education of their children and grandchildren and now must open their doors to let them back in when the economy did not seem to want the skills of recent graduates — or the jobs just plain end. Grandparents and parents don’t like that anymore than the unemployed graduates.\nThose who find work relatively quickly are graduates of specialized programs whose curricula relate directly to specific skills employers need. Many nursing and laser manufacturing programs at community colleges turn away students by the bushel.\nThe Great Recession may have done us one favor. We appreciate our jobs more, and more people consider two-year degrees that lead to profitable careers. This hardly makes a master’s degree in public administration obsolete, but the skills used after graduation may be those that deal with budgeting more than public policy. The economy seems to have enough thinkers, it’s looking to doers to set the pace for the next decade.\nThere is not truly a dichotomy between graduates who are thinkers or doers, of course, and not everyone needs to be a database manager, pharmacist, or physical therapist (gotta love those aging baby boomers). If graduates with a public sector management perspective cannot find a job quickly there are some strategies that may help.\n- Take a tip from young actors. No one will think less of you for doing part-time or volunteer work in your field while you make a living doing something outside of your hoped-for career field. And yes, it can be typing, table waiting, or sales.\n- Acquire more skills. Can you build a web page or maintain a small network? As web design or management moves beyond a discipline to a skill, if you can spend five hours a week updating a web page you will be a more attractive candidate than the job-seeker who still sees web work as a separate field. Community college courses are reasonably priced, and your Internet provider may provide free hosting, so practice is free.\n- Learn the ins and outs of public sector budgeting. Emphasis now is on making cuts, but even as tax revenues increase again, states and municipalities will continue to confront rising costs to maintain infrastructure or pay for employee pensions. See if you can be an intern for a local city or county as it prepares its budget. There is a major crunch (and no more staff) to draft the annual budget for a city council or county board of supervisors to approve, and even in a small town the city manager or budget director could appreciate your time. Even if you don’t go into public budgeting, what you learn will be useful throughout a career.\n- Ask currently employed workers in your hoped-for field to give you a fifteen-minute interview to describe what they do and the skills needed. You will learn something and it gives a potential employer a chance to know you without having to tell you there is no job.\n- Start a blog that deals with the area in which you want to work. You can write some, but you can also ask others in the field to write guest posts. You learn more and you are known as committed to your field.\n- Keep reading. Who would have thought Workforce 2020 would be read on a Kindle?\n- If all else fails, ask your parents or grandparents to stop postponing retirement. You may not get their job, but a friend might. Let the older generation stay home and start a blog.", "id": "<urn:uuid:72ec42ef-f9ce-45e1-8463-bdb5e6ec4832>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aspanational.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/changing-workforce-changing-job-hunting-skills/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:08:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9696837663650513, "token_count": 1359, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Aaand here we go to one more post of Assassin's Creed goodies ^^\nToday we go over Assassin's Creed Revelations revelations! XD\nFirst we have this awesome list of news gathered by User:Stormbeast on a blog of his, one which I am now reposting here for everyone to see ^^ I believe he will keep updating it, and when he does, I'll relay the info to all as always =]\nSince it has a truckload of spoilers, I'm listing it under the spoiler tag, click the \"show\" button to unveil the known features and reveal the truth!\n- If you get close enough to a person, e.g. following Yusuf at the beginning of the game, Ezio will go into autopilot and walk with him.\n- All memories concerning the Keys in Constantinople will be accessed through Sofia. The Altair memories within the Keys will be relatively short, but engaging. You do not have to activate the Key as soon as you touch it, leading to possible replay-ability of Altair memories as well.\n- There is an achievement/trophy for reaching the top of Hagia Sophia in under 30 seconds.\n- You can take a break from playing Ezio and return to Animus Island with Desmond through the menu. Doing so, Desmond can talk to Subject 16 and even hear the voices of Bill, Shaun, and Rebecca from the outside world. It is noted that Bill trained both Desmond and Lucy at a very young age.\n- Ezio can control his speed whilst zip-lining. (the faster option will attract a guard's attention)\n- You can test out bombs while crafting them to see their effect.\n- The 'random quests' can be anything, including moving 5 boxes across a street.\n- While disguised as a minstrel, the face buttons (X,B,Y,A on Xbox) has Ezio use different songs, mostly about Cesare. Pressing the right control stick activates Eagle Sense.\n- Ezio will aquire the Armor of Ishak Pasha, the Revelations counterpart of the Armors of Altair and Brutus.\n- Ottoman guards are marked on the mini-map with a yellow dot.\n- Ezio will fill the new HQ with books in place of paintings.\n- Ezio has all his old gear (including parachutes and the crossbow) from the beginning. Tunnel Booths have also returned.\n- Assassin recruiting will be more diverse than just saving civilians from guards. Some can be done through quests, e.g. catching a counterfeit thief or winning a race. The new Recruits will be categorized, involving the weapon they are most skilled in. In order to reach the level of Assassin and Master Assassin, your Recruit and you will have to track down a Templar Agent.\n- There are Animus Data Fragments throughout the city for Ezio to collect. These appear to look similar to the AC2 loading symbol.\n- The second Key is under Galata Tower. The only video we have is of Ezio almost falling to his doom.\n- The second Altair memory will take place directly after Al Mualim's death, leading to a fight with Abbas Sofian's followers and climbing to reach Abbas Sofian to retrieve the Apple. (Be careful of the Apple's pulses while climbing)\n- The third Key is housed in the Forum of Ox. In order to get there, Ezio must use Eagle Sense while perched on a view point to pick up hidden symbols leading him there. The Forum of Ox features a chase with Templars in a boat as riflemen shoot at Ezio.\n- The third Altair memory takes place after Altair's son, Sef, is killed. Not much is known other than Altair having to fight fellow Assassins to escape Masyaf.\n- So far the confirmed Templar Agents are the Crusader, Renegade, and Vanguard. (Multiplayer related)\n- There will be 5 new maps (Galata, Antioch, Knights Hospital, Souk, and Ippokratous) as well as 4 returning maps from Brotherhood. (Mont St. Michel, Rome, Castel Gandolfo, and Venice) \"Training Ground\" as seen in the Beta is now confirmed to be a 'noncompetitive, untimed mode' allowing you to 'explore the map, practice your abilities, and kill assigned target VIP' NPCs. (Multiplayer related)\nSources for the info listed above can be found on his blog post.\nSo that is all for today! Post your comments below – me and the staff want to hear your opinions!

It is becoming increasingly difficult for students to juggle the costs of living while working to obtain a University degree, and thus many students are finding themselves choosing between basic essentials such as food and toilet paper and the required costs of college. It is for this reason that The Pantry has been established to help offset these financial burdens and ensure that students may continue on to successfully complete and obtain their degrees from the University of California, Davis.\nThe Pantry is the result of a campus-wide collaboration between the Associated Students of the University of California, Davis (ASUCD), the Community Advising Network under the umbrella of Counseling and Psychological Services, and the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.

{"text": "\"Helplessness\" and \"confusion\" are words that easily come to mind when the issue of sick building syndrome is mentioned. It is a problem that does not have a regulatory solution, and is bound with engineering, medicine and emotions that will challenge the best of school administrators.\nA careful management style and knowledgeable use of technologies in medicine, toxicology and property maintenance are a school administrator's best allies in preparing to deal with or prevent this new generation of health and safety challenges.\nDefining sick building syndrome There is no regulatory definition for sick building syndrome. Although it often relates to indoor-air-quality problems, it simply means that the environment of a building is inspiring complaints of discomfort and/or disease.\nFundamentally, the causes of sick buildings relate to architecture and engineering patterns institutionalized in school construction following World War II. Schools of glass, rock and wood, with high ceilings, cross-ventilation via a transom over the door, and windows and radiators that could be adjusted by teachers no longer were built. These schools were being replaced with new, factory-like buildings featuring a temperamental, eccentric system of master controls for indoor environment. Buildings were constructed with no regard to the environment around them or to people within the property. Today, allowing for the ambiguity in defining sick buildings, somewhere between 1-in-5 and 1-in-15 school facilities are in a situation where discomfort and disease can be attributed to operations of the building.\nHealth symptoms in a sick building are highly variable, but generally split into three categories:\n-Radical reaction--a number of people clearly and suddenly ill. This usually involves limited air exchange combined with a \"smoking gun,\" which can include a new chemical cleaner, misbatched chlorine in a pool area, a weather inversion preventing a kiln from venting properly or a failure of a mechanical air-exchange system.\n-Unhealthy atmosphere--many people experiencing ongoing subtle illness or discomfort. The most common symptoms involve the dehydration of sensitive tissue, including sore eyes, throat or nasal membranes; a feeling of lethargy; a higher incidence of upper-respiratory infection; asthmatic reactions; low-grade headaches; and a continuum of muscle pain and general discomfort among building occupants. Much of this relates to oxygen deprivation typically caused by oxygen being displaced by other compounds, and occasionally by infestation of microbes as a result of excessive moisture remaining within the property.\n-Hypersensitive reaction or multiple chemical sensitivity reaction--one or two individuals extremely ill. This can result if even tiny exposures occur to anyone that has a highly sensitive reaction to certain chemicals. Typically, these complaints should be viewed as warnings that some low-level toxin is in the area.\nAlthough sick building syndrome usually relates to the general nature of the building itself, there are some specifics that account for most indoor-air problems:\n*Combustibles; any possible introduction of carbon monoxide. *Moisture as it may relate to mold (look for growths on drywall). *Moisture as it may relate to airborne infectious agents (standing water and consequent growths). *Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), usually cleaning agents or building materials, which may give off unpleasant, sometimes toxic gases. *Formaldehydes in new carpet, pressed wood or other building products. *Any new or newly exposed particleboard. *Applied poisons (pesticides, insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides).\nA proactive approach Administrators are dealing with a generation of post-World War II properties prone to indoor-air-quality problems, particularly buildings constructed or remodeled during the 1970s energy crisis. A school district should take several steps before a problem strikes. First, initiate patterns for preventing air-quality problems. Second, establish baseline information that will profile the building to facilitate an efficient, inexpensive and confidence-inspiring response. Building occupants and the community need to see a clear and confident administrative approach should a problem arise in the future.\nThe proactive investigation of the building should involve a limited amount of basic testing, particularly a professional review of the microbial matrix within the building--the number of colony-forming units or what kinds of microbes presently are nesting in the building. Understanding what is living in the ambient air can help administrators understand if there is a problem or, more importantly, can help to quickly isolate the exact nature of a problem.\nSimilarly, administrators should consider hiring an outside contractor to review how air-handling and mechanical-engineering systems are managed. A knowledgeable person should walk the area and observe the mechanical systems to see how the filtering system, the air-dispersion system and the air-dilution patterns of the building are operating. Finally, a reliable epidemiological profile of comparative absenteeism should be archived.\nAdministrators also need to be ready to implement a smooth, confidence-building reporting system for occupants regarding air-quality or sick-building concerns. How fast and capably the district responds can be the key to getting the issue under control. The costs for responding to indoor-air problems decrease dramatically if there is baseline data and a plan in place.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f673350f-8b06-4580-b54b-a3217aacfede>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://asumag.com/mag/university_prescribing_cure", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9389723539352417, "token_count": 1048, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "McLouth makes impact with homer, leaping grab\nRunning into wall, O's left fielder starts key double play to end Yanks' threat\nNEW YORK -- Hot for more than a month, Nate McLouth saw red for an entire inning Thursday night.\nLeading off the fifth, the Orioles left fielder drilled a fastball out to right at Yankee Stadium. Then, in the bottom of the inning, he made a leaping catch at the wall as he crashed into an electronic red sign he said was blindingly bright. That saved a run and started an inning-ending double play.\n\"I mean, it almost blinded me,\" McLouth said of the State Farm sign.\nBefore the O's took Game 4 of the American League Division Series, 2-1, over the Yankees in 13 innings, McLouth's homer was Baltimore's only run for 12 innings.\nThe O's leadoff man has been their best hitter this series, and he homered on a 1-2 pitch from Yanks starter Phil Hughes that got too much of the plate. That put Baltimore up, 1-0, and came after McLouth had walked and doubled in his first two plate appearances.\n\"It was obviously a mistake,\" said McLouth, who's hitting .333 (6-for-18) with two runs scored and three RBIs in the series. \"I think [Hughes] was trying to come in and didn't get it there. But you know, to get us on the board there, to get a lead there, it was the fifth inning, it was nice. I put a pretty good swing on it.\"\nMcLouth has hits in all four games of the series, coming off his hottest month of the season, September, when he posted a .298/.372/.491 line. At an opportune time like this, he said he's feeling as good as he has all year.\n\"I really do,\" McLouth said. \"It's funny, when you feel good, and you get good pitches, you don't miss 'em. When you're struggling, you'll foul those pitches back. I just, yeah, I've been able to slow things down at the plate, and I think that's kind of what any hitter will tell you when they're feeling pretty good. They're able to stay under control.\"\nThe catch in the bottom of the inning was remarkable in itself. The 7-6-3 double play he started with a relay to J.J. Hardy made it that much sweeter.\nThe Yankees had a runner on first base with one out, and Jayson Nix, starting at shortstop in place of Derek Jeter, hit a deep drive to left. McLouth raced back to the left-field wall, leapt and came up with it as his left side hit against the sign. His jump was well-timed, so he didn't hit the wall with overwhelming force.\n\"That's that deep part out there,\" McLouth said. \"I went back, I knew it was going to be close to the wall. And I took my eye off the ball for a second and it was kind of weird, because when I took my off the ball, I looked right into -- there's like a bright red State Farm [sign] out there -- and I mean it almost blinded me. Because I wanted to check where the wall was, but I just happened to look right at that bright sign, and it kind of threw me off for a second. But I was able to pick up the ball again when I looked back.\"\nEssentially, McLouth preserved the shutdown inning, and all the momentum he himself had created with the home run.\nFrom his vantage point, catcher Matt Wieters wasn't sure McLouth had a chance at the ball, but he wasn't surprised by the play. To Wieters, the O's have two center fielders: one playing that position, Adam Jones, and the other playing left, McLouth.\n\"I didn't know he had it, but I knew if he had a chance, Nate was going to come down with the ball,\" Wieters said. \"He ran a long way for that ball, and was able to get it and make a good throw to J.J. to get a double play. That was a huge out in the game, and something that gave us a little bit of relief, to get back in the dugout with the lead.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:ec0c647d-051b-48d6-a486-b8c106f4aff2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121011&content_id=39730740&vkey=news_bal&c_id=bal", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:29Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9906680583953857, "token_count": 919, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Ethiopian kids hack Zoom tablets in five months.\nThe One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project recently tried a new approach to distributing computers to developing countries, by leaving boxes of tablets in remote Ethiopian villages with no instructions. The Motorola Zoom tablets had a custom English language OS, a solar charger, and tracking software to monitor how they were used.\nTo the surprise of the organization, not only could the kids who started using the tablets easily figure out how to switch on and use them, but they also learnt to hack into the OS and enable features - amazing especially seeing as most of the kids had never seen a printed word before, let alone in English.\n“We left the boxes in the village. Closed. Taped shut. No instruction, no human being. I thought, the kids will play with the boxes! Within four minutes, one kid not only opened the box, but found the on/off switch. He’d never seen an on/off switch. He powered it up. Within five days, they were using 47 apps per child per day. Within two weeks, they were singing ABC songs [in English] in the village. And within five months, they had hacked Android. Some idiot in our organization or in the Media Lab had disabled the camera! And they figured out it had a camera, and they hacked Android.”\nOLPC used the experiment to see whether kids can teach themselves to read and write English. Research shows that 100,000,000 kids worldwide don’t even make to to first grade, often because there are no schools or teachers available. For the cost of a tablet, that could all change.

{"text": "May 7, 2012 § 2 Comments\nThe Last of a Half-breed / on The Death of Jim Loney by James Welch\nWelch’s sad book is set in mid-70’s rural Montana somewhere on the outskirts of the Fort Belknap Indian reservation. In this tragic story, cheap alcohol fuels a prevailing sense of alienation and longing for an imagined elsewhere—life should be better somewhere else. A perennial overgrowth of American Indian under-education, alcoholism and infighting captures the reader in a depressive continuity of life’s potential for hopelessness. Welch gives us a masterful retelling of boredom amidst the desolation of failed dreams. This is an American Indian story of existential angst that goes far beyond a clichéd and ghettoized other. Welch leaves us with a narrative that calls into question the very real confrontation with Jim Loney’s identity as a so-called half breed (Gros Ventre/Anglo), his broken family, his restless love life, and his hard-to-place value as a fallible man. James Welch’s The Death of Jim Loney soberly regards the plight of the American Indian, troubled personal identity, and the existential problems that arise from filial neglect and societal estrangement.\nWe always have to be cautious when confronting racial issues and how they are addressed, especially with regard to the personal bias we bring to such matters. Although Welch does write about an American-Indian, he tells the story from the uneasy perspective of Jim Loney and his immediate relationships. This story is one of human identity, an identity that’s become displaced, and then broken. We already come to the novel knowing that American-Indians have been displaced in their own land, but in The Death of Jim Loney existential problems of belonging lie underneath the poverty of Loney’s day to day circumstances. If any American-Indian issues are politicized in the book, they are carefully implied and are not overt. In fact, such issues of displaced identity are suggested by Welch with graceful subtlety. For example, when Welch writes about Loney’s half-breed status, he has Loney’s girlfriend Rhea suggest to him that to be a half-breed is to be lucky to choose from one set of ancestors or the other: “Oh, you’re so lucky to have two sets of ancestors. Just think, you can be Indian on one day and white the next. Whichever suits you” (2008, p. 13). The naïve irony of his girlfriend’s comment does little to comfort us (and him) since we know that society doesn’t give us this choice. Here in America, if you are born half white and your other ethnic half is a minority group, you must identify as that minority group, if you don’t, you’re flatly dismissed as being in a state of self-hating denial.\nIf you happen to belong to a minority group, any resulting problems of racial and personal identity are left for you to sort through openly, or not. If you don’t have the tenacity to deal with it, this can lead to strong feelings of displacement and a general sense of not belonging. But is this is somehow a uniquely American-Indian dilemma? We already know that it’s not; we don’t have to be American-Indian to question our place in the world. One doesn’t need to be a minority to contemplate one’s existence. However, with this said, we’ll have to acknowledge that a minority status can lead to feelings of alienation. Displacement from the larger group can lead one to feel like an outsider.\nThis takes us to the philosophy of Existentialism. The general focus of Existentialism is on the existence of the individual and the choices he makes from there, if he is able to recognize that his existence relies on his own self-determinism and not on an external morality, or objective standards of living. In the strictest sense, he always has the freedom to choose one way or another. Let us be sure to make the point that Welch’s Loney never tries to philosophically solve his existential dilemma, we’re only left with his broken family life, his semi-romantic love life, his tenuous friendships, his alcoholism, his violence, and his eventual demise. We are matter-of-factly presented with all these unresolved problems of his existence that lead Loney to a self manipulated death. In Colin Wilson’s first book The Outsider he covers the Existentialism of the alienated outsider from the philosophical perspective of many authors and thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche wrote at length about overcoming the status quo, about questioning existence and the power of the individual to forge a new path above and beyond the prevailing norms. Welch’s Jim Loney is precariously at the precipice of this kind of rejection of the way things are—he is on the very edge of transcendence—yet he never gets there, he just doesn’t know how. “He [Loney] tried to think of all the little things that added up to a man sitting at a table drinking wine. […] all the people and events were hopelessly tangled as a bird’s nest is his mind” (Welch, 2008, p. 18). Loney inadvertently shows us that personal growth can’t flourish if we absent-mindedly drink away our thoughts. In The Outsider, Wilson speaks of the way Nietzsche had to reject the complacency of traditional values in a society that stifles free thinking: “Unless he can evolve a set of values that will correspond to his higher intensity of purpose, he may as well throw himself under a bus, for he will always be an outcast and a misfit” (1956, p.142). Loney never gets to a higher purpose. His goal is not to challenge tradition. Loney’s choices are (self) limited.\nLoney’s existence awkwardly stares at him, and by extension we try to think of how this reflects our own lives. It’s only by his inability to squarely lift himself up from his plight, do we confront a desire to do this for ourselves. This problem of Loney’s is carefully expressed by Welch when Loney watches a neighbor hanging her laundry. He does this while contemplating where his life should lead from here. “He wasn’t ready to do anything but sit on his step and think, and so he watched the two shirts twist and knot around each other and he thought, not of Seattle, but of the blue veins on the backs of his neighbor’s legs” (2008, p.42). This kind of contemplation with the bare facts of reality recall Jean Paul Sartre’s character Antoine Roquentin in the book Nausea, and his famous existential epiphany with a chestnut tree, yet with one critical distinction: Loney can’t see a way to transcend his basic choices. He can’t grasp his own basic existential freedom. In Nausea Sartre writes: “Existence is not something which lets itself be thought of at a distance: it must invade you suddenly, master you, weigh heavily on your heart like a great motionless beast—or else there is nothing more at all” (1964, p. 177). For Sartre man’s very confrontation with nothing and of existence impels him to grow into what he wants to be. Loney doesn’t know he can change, therefore Sartre would say he was acting in ‘bad faith.’ When we’re acting in bad faith we are not acknowledging our freedom to choose another way, we’ve blindly accepted our so-called fate. In bad faith we are the victims of circumstantial fatalism.\nWelch’s Loney is opaque and inaccessible to himself, he “…couldn’t sleep because if he slept he would dream, so he stared into the blackness of the small bedroom” (2008, p. 94). A few lines later, Loney thinks of the next day where he’ll be hunting bear with his sometime friend Myron Pretty Weasel, where he blankly thinks: “After tomorrow’s slim purpose I will simply exist” (Welch, 2008, p. 95). These are frightening thoughts when we learn later that Loney will shoot the curiously named Pretty Weasel, presumably mistaking him for a bear in the cattails. In Julia Kristeva’s psychoanalytic/philosohical work Strangers to Ourselves, she details the complex ways an outsider is perceived and how they perceive themselves. It’s made clear that the foreigner internalizes much of their perceived self-identity and hatred, as much as society imposes these insecurities onto the other. We’ll be safe to suggest that American-Indians have been a kind of native foreigner, sadly thought of as foreigners on their own homeland. This becomes a kind of self-exile enacted by Loney’s futile escape from belonging to his family or anywhere else as he eventually runs headlong unto his death at Mission Canyon. Kristeva writes: “…according to the utmost logic of exile, all aims should waste away and self-destruct in the wonderer’s insane stride toward an elsewhere that is always pushed back, unfulfilled, out of reach” (1991, p. 6). Although Kristeva is not an Existentialist, her views on foreigners, the stranger, the other do coincide with Loney’s lack of belonging that leads to a feeling of being exiled within his own family and community. Loney is never ‘at home’ in the world.\nWe never really understand where Loney’s going except down. The rambling intensity of his actions are magnified by the coldness of his estranged father Ike, especially when Loney suggests that their situation could’ve been better. Ike ignorantly questions this: “Shit, what would we have done but drink ourselves to death?” (Welch, 2008, p. 132). After this, Loney walks away from his dad’s trailer and shoots into one of the windows with the shotgun his dad gave him minutes earlier.\nIf we return to the very first page of the story, we find Loney recounting an odd Biblical passage that sticks itself in us because of its bald pessimism. “Turn away from man in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?” (Welch, 2008, p. 1). We’re not told that this is from Isaiah 2:22, but that doesn’t matter when we think of what it means, and what it might mean for Loney. Turn away from a breathing man, because there is not accounting for him because he’s mortal. This has to be a Biblical way to emphasize the fallibility of man against an all perfect God. Yet, for our secular use here, the haunting phrase speaks to a darker message: no one living is to be trusted. Loney came from the chaos of a broken home. As we witness his confused adult life, his options are few. Loney in his depressive complacency barely trusts anyone. Midway in the book, a little boy named Amos After Buffalo watches Loney cut his dead dog from the frozen mud on Thanksgiving day—a day that’s not really an American-Indian holiday. This little boy is recalled before Loney dies where Loney talks to a stray black dog in Mission Canyon. “You tell Amos that Jim Loney passed through town while he was dreaming. Don’t tell him you saw me with a bottle and a gun. That wouldn’t do. Tell him you saw me carrying a dog and that I was taking that dog to higher ground. He will know” (Welch, 2008, p. 147).\nJames Welch’s The Death of Jim Loney carries us over to a deep sense of sadness. This in-depth sadness is brought about by Loney’s inability to maneuver his circumstance to even a slightly better place. His displaced existence glares at him and it hurts us to have read about it. It is in this liquor-fuelled alienation that we can learn to empathize with people, as we can recognize such tendencies in ourselves. It is as the philosophers show us, that it is our choice to blindly accept fatalism, the status quo, the norms, the way-it-should-be, or not. If we can’t do this hard work of liberating ourselves nobody else can do it for us. This ultimately reveals how James Welch has helped us, by showing what life looks like when we refuse to see ourselves as full of potential, and when we fail to see ourselves as living with pure possibility.\nKristeva, Julia.

{"text": "These wise words from Tolstoy seem even more relevant 100 years on.\nMatt Ridley has published a great essay in WIRED SCIENCE today. Ridley nails an issue that has plagued humanity since time immemorial. Some supposedly intelligent human beings become so convinced that Doomsday is upon them that nothing will persuade them to the contrary. Ridley’s essay is a must read for everyone interested in Doomsday predictions that have failed to materialise and why we should dump the Climate Scare in the same basket.\nWhen the sun rises on December 22, as it surely will, do not expect apologies or even a rethink. No matter how often apocalyptic predictions fail to come true, another one soon arrives. And the prophets of apocalypse always draw a following—from the 100,000 Millerites who took to the hills in 1843, awaiting the end of the world, to the thousands who believed in Harold Camping, the Christian radio broadcaster who forecast the final rapture in both 1994 and 2011.\nReligious zealots hardly have a monopoly on apocalyptic thinking. Consider some of the environmental cataclysms that so many experts promised were inevitable. Best-selling economist Robert Heilbroner in 1974: “The outlook for man, I believe, is painful, difficult, perhaps desperate, and the hope that can be held out for his future prospects seem to be very slim indeed.” Or best-selling ecologist Paul Ehrlich in 1968: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s [\"and 1980s\" was added in a later edition] the world will undergo famines—hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked on now … nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.” Or Jimmy Carter in a televised speech in 1977: “We could use up all of the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade.”\nPredictions of global famine and the end of oil in the 1970s proved just as wrong as end-of-the-world forecasts from millennialist priests. Yet there is no sign that experts are becoming more cautious about apocalyptic promises. If anything, the rhetoric has ramped up in recent years. Echoing the Mayan calendar folk, theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock one minute closer to midnight at the start of 2012, commenting: “The global community may be near a point of no return in efforts to prevent catastrophe from changes in Earth’s atmosphere.”\nAPOCOHOLISM IS GROWING\nOver the five decades since the success of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 and the four decades since the success of the Club of Rome’s The Limits to Growth in 1972, prophecies of doom on a colossal scale have become routine. Indeed, we seem to crave ever-more-frightening predictions—we are now, in writer Gary Alexander’s word, apocaholic. The past half century has brought us warnings of population explosions, global famines, plagues, water wars, oil exhaustion, mineral shortages, falling sperm counts, thinning ozone, acidifying rain, nuclear winters, Y2K bugs, mad cow epidemics, killer bees, sex-change fish, cell-phone-induced brain-cancer epidemics, and climate catastrophes.\nSo far all of these specters have turned out to be exaggerated. True, we have encountered obstacles, public-health emergencies, and even mass tragedies. But the promised Armageddons—the thresholds that cannot be uncrossed, the tipping points that cannot be untipped, the existential threats to Life as We Know It—have consistently failed to materialize. To see the full depth of our apocaholism, and to understand why we keep getting it so wrong, we need to consult the past 50 years of history.\nRidley takes the reader through a modern day analogy of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.\nThe classic apocalypse has four horsemen, and our modern version follows that pattern, with the four riders being chemicals (DDT, CFCs, acid rain), diseases (bird flu, swine flu, SARS, AIDS, Ebola, mad cow disease), people (population, famine), and resources (oil, metals). Let’s visit them each in turn.Read it all here", "id": "<urn:uuid:39cd3ba2-0f3d-47b0-b89f-dee9760eeaa2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://austeaparty.com.au/web/the-end-is-not-nigh-but-many-of-us-just-dont-get-it/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:08:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9376201033592224, "token_count": 909, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean; Navigational"]}
{"text": "The Independent Jane\nFor all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.\nElizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.\nThe freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.\nAlthough Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.\nWhen accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,\n“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”\n“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”\n“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”\nThat same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.\n“Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”\nI find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.\nJohn Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.\nComparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.\nJefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.\nJane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.", "id": "<urn:uuid:0d8a309d-25c5-405d-a08a-c11239f0d717>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://austenauthors.net/the-independent-jane", "date": "2013-05-18T05:07:06Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9743200540542603, "token_count": 845, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Bohn, M. S. (1977) Response of a subsonic nozzle to acoustic and entropy disturbances. Journal of Sound and Vibration , 52 (2). pp. 283-297. ISSN 0022-460X http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20101213-104516314\n- Published Version\nRestricted to Caltech community only\nSee Usage Policy.\nUse this Persistent URL to link to this item: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20101213-104516314\nThe one-dimensional response of a subsonic nozzle flow to small pressure and entropy disturbances is calculated. The response is expressed in terms of transmitted acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle in the same direction as the disturbance wave) and reflected acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle in the direction opposite to that of the disturbance wave) for three independent disturbances: a downstreampropagating acoustic wave impinging upon the nozzle inlet, an upstream-propagating wave impinging upon the nozzle exit, and an entropy wave convecting through the nozzle. The solution for high frequency disturbances is discussed and used with the compact (long wavelength disturbance) solution to normalize several numerical calculations. The normalization shows that the transmitted waves created by the two acoustic disturbances may be represented by the same function offrequency for a given inlet and exit nozzle Mach number. The same is seen to be true for the reflected waves created by the two acoustic disturbances. The normalization allows results for a wide range of nozzle Mach number distributions and disturbance frequencies to be presented concisely.\n|Additional Information:||© 1977 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We have tested the reproducibility of this result by analyzing gravity data from boreholes in Nevada. One interpretation of our resuls suggests a breakdown of the Newtonian theory which is much larger than the effect previously reported. But the lack of consistency between the results suggests that it is not fundamental physics that has failed, but rather the experiments are subject to large systematic uncertainties which are caused by mass anomalies at intermediate distances from the holes.\n|Additional Information:||©1990 The American Physical Society Received 26 September 1989 This work was supported in part by grants from the Department of Energy (No. DEAC-0381-ER40050) and by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Individual Research and Development fund.

(April 2013)|\nThe Hindenburgdamm Rail Causeway across the Wadden Sea to the island of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany\n|Ancestor||None. (See Ford (crossing))|\n|Related||None. (See step-stone bridge)|\n|Descendant||None. (See viaduct)|\n|Material||Concrete, masonry, Earth-fill|\nA causeway is a road or railway route across a broad body of water or wetland raised up on an embankment. Some causeways may only be usable at low tide and the distinction between causeways and viaducts can become blurred when flood-relief culverts are incorporated in the structure; a causeway is however primarily supported on earth or stone, whereas a bridge or viaduct is mainly supported by free-standing columns or arches.\nWhen first used, the word appeared in a form such as “causey way” making clear its derivation from the earlier form “causey”. This word seems to have come from the same source by two different routes. It derives ultimately, from the Latin for heel, calx, and most likely comes from the trampling technique to consolidate earthworks. In Ancient times, the construction was trodden down, one layer at a time, often by slaves or flocks of sheep. Today, this work is done by machines. The same technique would have been used for road embankments, raised river banks, sea banks and fortification earthworks. (The layers, though not the trampling action, can be seen in the Bayeux Tapestry: Building Hastings Castle.)\nThe second derivation route is simply the hard, trodden surface of a path. The name by this route came to be applied to a firmly surfaced road. It is now little-used except in dialect and in the names of roads which were originally notable for their solidly made surface.\nThe word is comparable in both meanings with the French chaussée, from a form of which it reached English by way of Norman French. The French adjective, chaussée, carries the meaning of having been given a hardened surface, and is used to mean either paved or shod. As a noun chaussée is used on the one hand for a metalled carriageway, and on the other for an embankment with or without a road. Other languages have a noun with similar dual meaning. In Welsh, it is sarn. The Welsh is relevant here, as it also has a verb, sarnu, meaning to trample. The trampling and ramming technique for consolidating earthworks was used in fortifications and there is a comparable, outmoded form of wall construction technique, used in such work and known as pisé, a word derived not from trampling but from ramming or tamping.\nThe modern embankment may be constructed within a cofferdam: two parallel steel sheet pile or concrete retaining walls, anchored to each other with steel cables or rods. This construction may also serve as a dyke that keeps two bodies of water apart, such as bodies with a different water level on each side, or with salt water on one side and fresh water on the other. This may also be the primary purpose of a structure, the road providing a hardened crest for the dike, slowing erosion in the event of an overflow. It also provides access for maintenance as well perhaps, as a public service.\nNotable causeways include those that connect Singapore and Malaysia (the Johor–Singapore Causeway), Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (25-km long King Fahd Causeway) and Venice to the mainland, all of which carry roadways and railways. In the Netherlands there are a number of prominent dykes which also double as causeways, including the Afsluitdijk, Brouwersdam, and Markerwaarddijk. In Louisiana, two very long bridges, called the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, stretch across Lake Pontchartrain for almost 38 km, making them the world's longest bridges (if total length is considered instead of span length). They are also the oldest causeways on the Gulf Coast that have never been put out of commission for an extended period of time following a hurricane. In the Republic of Panama a causeway connects the islands of Perico, Flamenco, and Naos to Panama City on the mainland. It also serves as a breakwater for ships entering the Panama Canal. Its English name causeway is sometimes confused with \"Coastway\", name of a touristic zone in Panama city. The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan had causeways supporting roads and aqueducts. The oldest engineered road yet discovered is the Sweet Track in England, dating from the 3800s BC.\nCauseways are also common in Florida, where low bridges may connect several man-made islands, often with a much higher bridge (or part of a single bridge) in the middle so that taller boats may pass underneath safely. Causeways are most often used to connect the barrier islands with the mainland.\nThe Churchill Barriers in Orkney are of the most notable sets of causeways in Europe. Constructed in waters up to 18 metres deep, the four barriers link five islands on the eastern side of the natural harbour at Scapa Flow. They were built during World War II as military defences for the harbour, on the orders of Winston Churchill.\nThe Estrada do Istmo connecting the islands of Taipa and Coloane in Macau was initially built as a causeway. The sea on both sides of the causeway had become shallower as a result of silting, and mangroves had conquer the area. Later on land reclamation took place on both sides of the road and the area has subsequently be named Cotai and become home of several casino complexes. In Okinawa, Japan, connected by the Mid-Sea Road are the Katsuren Peninsula, Henza Island, Miyagi Island, Ikei Island and Hamahiga-Island.\nSpecific causeways around the world \n|This section requires expansion. (April 2009)|\nVarious causeways in the world:\n- Canso Causeway, Nova Scotia, Canada ( )\n- Hindenburgdamm, Germany ( )\n- Johor-Singapore Causeway ( )\n- Lake Ponchartrain Causeway, Louisiana ( )\n- King Fahd Causeway, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia ( )\n- Venice ( )\n- Mahim Causeway, Mumbai, India\n- Swarkestone causeway, Derby, England, United Kingdom\n- Causeway across Haraldssund, Faroe Islands\n- Causeway across Hvannasund, Faroe Islands\n- Rømødæmningen, Denmark, connecting Rømø (island) with the mainland across the wadden sea\n- MacArthur Causeway, Florida, United States\nCauseways affect currents and may therefore be involved in beach erosion or changed deposition patterns; this effect has been a problem at the Hindenburgdamm in northern Germany. During hurricane seasons, the winds and rains of approaching tropical storms--as well as waves generated by the storm in the surrounding bodies of water—make traversing causeways problematic at best and impossibly dangerous during the fiercest parts of the storms. For this reason (and related reasons, such as the need to minimize traffic jams on both the roads approaching the causeway and the causeway itself), emergency evacuation of island residents is a high priority for local, regional, and even national authorities.\nSee also \n- The Causeway, Western Australia\n- Causey Arch, County Durham, England\n- Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Metairie, Louisiana, Southern; Mandeville, Louisiana, Northern.\n- Pulaski Skyway\n- Oxford English Dictionary. 1971.

{"text": "Great news for pilots: After at least 10 very slow years, the aviation industry is in a period of growth. Experts predict that we'll encounter a drastic pilot shortage in the coming years, which means that your dream job may not be as far away as you thought!\nIf you're looking for a flying job, here are a few links to check out:\nIf you're a low-time pilot, then US Pilot is a great site to start with. It is updated constantly with flight instruction, banner towing, aerial mapping, part 135 and corporate pilot jobs. Membership is free.\nPopular among defense companies, AviationEmployment.com typically has a lot of job postings for test pilots and military veterans.\nThis widely-used website has been around since 1988, and according to their website, is the leading site for aviation and airline jobs. On Avjobs.com, you can learn about and search for pilot jobs, read articles, browse through tips and advice, search for an aviation school, subscribe to newsletters, and even get help with your resume. All of these services come with a charge, though. There are different payment plans for different services, with discounts for students and military members.\nAviation Week reaches over 185 countries, so their job board includes job openings from around the world. You'll see a variety of jobs here, but it's another hot spot for defense jobs and government contract jobs at places like Boeing, Northrup-Grumman, Sikorsky, and the military. There are a few corporate and flight instructor jobs openings listed here, as well.\nThe FAA hires pilots to create and inspect operations, both in the air and on the ground. Pilots for the FAA can inspect airways, test and identify problems with terminal and enroute procedures, etc. The FAA will surely be hiring more pilots to assist with the implementation of NextGen, so check out the FAA jobs website for updates.\nAvianation.com is another job site that charges monthly or yearly fees to search and apply for jobs. The website boasts that they offer the most variety of job postings for low-time to high-time pilots. It's good for pilots looking for a global career, as well as cargo operations. The site does seem to incorporate information from a variety of sources. As with any site that charges, be careful you aren't paying for information you could be getting for free (such as job postings from the FAA and NTSB, which can always be found on the respective individual websites).\nThe monster of all job search sites, Monster.com is always a good place to look. It's a little light on the aviation jobs, especially flying jobs, and you might have to weed through the ads and irrelevant work-at-home jobs to find what you need. But Monster is a good tool for those of you that can relocate. There are a lot of postings for metropolitan areas, but you may notice that there are few listings for smaller cities and towns.\nSimilar to Monster.com, you may get lucky and find a few pilot postings here if you can get through the ads and unrelated postings. Be aware of the many pilot jobs for military careers (unless that's what you're looking for). The posts rarely disclose the military commitment required up front, and it can be a time-waster if you don't actually desire (or qualify for) a flying career in the military.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e8c9d87e-f09d-4871-a795-82aaf7aa2d3a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://aviation.about.com/od/Resources-for-Job-Seekers/tp/The-Best-Job-Search-Websites-For-Pilots.htm", "date": "2013-05-18T06:01:47Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9629371166229248, "token_count": 696, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "See this related question - it's about the video production's vibe that Sony Vegas in \"unprofessional\" compared to Avid (who make ProTools) and Final Cut.\nLet's start with this: FLStudio it's a tool with which you're familiar. That's a huge plus in terms of learning curve for getting things done.\nWith DAWs, the output is comparable. ProTools can't make better ones or zeros than any other package. There are going to be inherent differences in the audio codecs depending on which one ships with whose products.\nThe tool, in and of itself, it not the issue. Professionalism comes from a.) the recording quality and b.) the skill of the engineer. Record with a crappy mic that's not been properly placed in a room that's not properly soundproofed, and Bob Katz himself couldn't fix it. Conversely, mic it right and choose the right place to record, and if you know your tool, you can create awesome recordings.\nShould you switch? That's up to you, but here are some things to consider:\n1.) Can you accomplish everything you need to record and output great audio with FLStudio?\n2.) Will you ever have a need to exchange files with someone else...e.g., will you ever need to send your stubs to a mastering studio? And is the output you send them compatible with, most likely, ProTools or Live?\n3.) How important is it that it's compatible with other studios' equipment?\n4.) Can FLStudio output redbook compliant CD image files?\n5.) How important is it that you have an image of professionalism? Will you lose business because of your software? or will you retain business, regardless of software because of your mad audio skillz?\nIf you know how to make great audio, that's where the professionalism comes from. Not the software. Yes, there may be solid business reasons to invest in one package or another, mostly revolving around the extent to which you'll share files to collaborate. Secondary will be for marketing purposes...but honestly, with some great demos, you can overcome the second quite handily.\nSoftware is nothing more than a tool.

{"text": "\"GOT NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES\"\nIt is September 19,1783. The place, Lyons, France. Preparations are being made for a journey. A journey that will eventually take man from his secure environment of terra firma, and place him in a hostile environment called the atmosphere. The vehicle to be used is a hot air balloon. The brainchild behind this trek is a wealthy paper maker named Joseph Montgolfier. There has been much speculation over just how Montgolfier made the discovery of the hot air balloon. The most commonly-believed story is that his wife was standing too close to a fire and that the smoke caused her skirt to be inflated and lifted above her knees. This caused Montgolfier to wonder-if this smoke, and its magical lifting powers, could be captured in a very large container, it might rise and lift a passenger along with it.\nSo, Montgolfier went about building the first hot air balloon. In 1783,\nnot much was known about the atmosphere and its effects on human beings.\nUpon examination of the occupants for any ill effects caused by this lofty height, it was discovered that the duck had a broken wing. Could this have been an effect of exposure to altitude? Actually, several observers noted that as the balloon left the ground, the sheep had an anxiety attack and kicked the duck. Montgolfier reasoned that it would be safe for humans to ascend to altitude. So on November 21, 1783, Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier (a surgeon) became the first aeronaut and flight surgeon. Over 200 years have passed since that first flight. Technology has allowed us to ascend through the atmosphere and into space, but the hazards of high altitude flight (hypoxia, altitude-induced decompression sickness, and trapped gases) will always be present. That is because humans are best suited to live in what is known as the \"physiological efficient zone\". This zone extends from sea level to 12,000 feet. When humans are exposed to altitudes above this zone, they are subjected to physiological hazards beyond their natural ability to adapt.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that everything that occupies space and exerts weight is considered to be matter. All matter is made up of atoms and molecules in varying densities. These particles within the matter are kinetic and in constant motion. The slower the motion of the particles, the more dense the matter becomes. Also, as the particles are pushed closer together, the matter also becomes more dense. The best way to slow down kinetic molecules is to cool the matter. The best way to get them to move closer together is to add pressure to the matter. Inversely, when you remove the pressure or heat any material, the molecules within the material moves faster and further apart, thus making the material less dense.\nThe least dense form of matter is, of course, gas. If a gas is cooled and compressed, at some point it will become a liquid. If that liquid is then cooled further, then at some point it will become a solid. Also, when you take the pressure off any gas or liquid, that material will grow less dense and expand. This is essentially what happens to the gaseous molecules of our atmosphere.\nOur atmosphere contains approximately 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, a constant ratio until you reach an altitude of about 270,000 feet. So the question that always comes up is; \"If I have 21% oxygen at sea level and 21% at 40,000 feet, why do I succumb to the effects of hypoxia within 20 seconds at that altitude?\"\nThe answer is, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE! If you could picture all the gaseous nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, they would stack up from the surface of the earth to the fringe of space. All these molecules stacking on top each other create a great deal of weight, or pressure. At sea level, one square-inch of any surface has about 15 pounds of air sitting on top of it. At 18,000 feet, that same square inch has only 7.5 pounds per square-inch (psi) exerted on it. What has caused this atmospheric pressure drop? The answer is simple: There is more air stacked up at sea level than above 18,000 feet, and therefore, more weight.\nAs you recall, when molecules are subjected to this pressure, they are going to move closer together. This will make the air more dense with oxygen and nitrogen molecules. For example, if at sea level you take in a breath of air that has an atmospheric pressure of 15 psi, then that air may contain 500 billion molecules of oxygen (this a fictitious number to be used only as an example); if you go to 18,000 feet and take the same breath where atmospheric pressure is 7.5 psi, then you will pull in only 250 billion molecules of oxygen. But, you require 500 billion per breath to function normally, and you're getting only half of what you need. That's HYPOXIA!\nNot only do gaseous molecules in the atmosphere expand with reduced total pressure, gases in the human body are also subject to the same expansion. There are several areas in the body- ears, sinuses, lungs, gastro-intestinal tract, and teeth - where these gases can expand and cause a variety of problems. As long as the gas can expand and escape, there will be no problem. But if the gas becomes trapped, then pain will be the usual result.\nAs we have discussed earlier, the air we breathe contains about 79% nitrogen. Nitrogen is inhaled into the lungs and distributed and stored throughout the body. According to gas laws, gases of higher pressure always exert force towards areas of low pressure. When you inhale nitrogen, it will be stored at a pressure of about 12 psi (79% nitrogen) of 15 psi (total atmospheric pressure), equal to about 12 psi).\nWhen you ascend to altitude and the pressure around your body begins to drop, this creates a pressure gradient (higher nitrogen in the body than outside the body) and the nitrogen will try to equalize and escape outside the body. Sometimes this nitrogen can leave so quickly and in such quantify that it may form a bubble. If this bubble forms at a body joint, the pain it causes is know as \"the bends.\"\nThese are just a few of the problems that can occur when the human body is exposed to high altitude conditions. These problems will always be there for aviation. But through education and knowledge of the mechanisms that cause these problems, we can take steps toward protection and prevention so that your BLUE SKIES won't give you a case of the blues.\nby J.R.

{"text": "In my previous post about the command pattern, I gushed about how much I loved it. That doesn’t mean that the command pattern as originally envisioned is still completely in fashion.\nIn particular, the notion of “Undo” was one of the major features in the command pattern’s cap. Today, that is almost never the case. Sure, if you are building an application such as an editor. Something like Photoshop or a text editor would find the notion of commands with the ability to have an undo stack very compelling. Other than that, however, that is a very rare need.\nIn most business scenarios, there really is no good way to undo things. How would you implement SendEmailCommand.Undo(), for example? But even something like PlaceOrder.Undo() is a lot more complex and hard to do than you would think. The mere notion of undoing the operation assumes that this isn’t going to have any side affects. But cancelling an order may result in cancellation fees, require you to ship back things you got back, end. It is not “Undoing PlaceOrder”, rather that is a whole different and distinct business process, usually represented by another command: CancelOrder.\nAnother common issue that people have is the degeneration of the entire architecture to something like:\nTo that I answer, more power to you! I love code that is composed of a lot of small classes all doing things about the same way. There is no easier way to look at a system, and that allows you to quite easily add additional functionality to the system easily. That said, mind how you handle routing in that scenario. I have seen people go into the “when a request comes to this URL, let us invoke the following commands” in XML. One of the reasons that people dislike this approach is how you actually call this. If just getting to the command executer is hard and involved, you lose a lot of the advantages.\nThis popped up in the mailing list, and I really dislike it. The notion of Composite Command. A command that can execute multiple commands. Now, from a programming point of view, I can easily see why you would want to do that. The PlaceOrderCommand operation is composed of a lot of smaller commands. But, and this is important, the notion of Composite Commands basically mean that you get the same thing as the PlaceOrderCommand, but you just lost the name. And naming is important. Almost as important, error handling is quite different between different business scenarios, and you sometimes end up with something like:\nAnd this is simple, how do you handle an error in the ShipOrderCommand after you already charged the card, for example?", "id": "<urn:uuid:f209779a-44bd-48da-8eac-183944c1f68c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ayende.com/blog/159969/design-patterns-in-the-test-of-time-command-redux?key=a4f5a0b6-d2c6-4949-bc44-e9d567d16340", "date": "2013-05-18T06:49:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9652654528617859, "token_count": 561, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

This would explain why I keep screwing them up.\nFirst, there was the \"baking soda or baking powder\" fiasco. Which one do you add to the batter to help it puff a little while cooking? I kept forgetting, and I'd add baking soda instead of powder and I'd end up with little hockey pucks.\nThen there is the \"eggs or no eggs\" question. It seems as if adding eggs just encourages the batter to rubberize. But without eggs all I end up with is cardboard.\nAnd let's not even start on the counter-intuitiveness of the idea that getting the pancakes to cook through the middle without burning on the outside requires a high heat in the pan, and a quick turn, instead of a medium heat with a slow turn. Anything else cooked in that pan that I want to be cooked evenly requires a lower heat and a slow turn. But I have to forget all of that when I'm using a reactive batter that does weird things when heat is applied. Or else I end up with blackened discs of raw dough.\nBatter. That term alone should have clued me in that the normal cooking rules do not apply with pancakes.\nOne cannot eyeball the amount of baking\nsoda powder to be added to the flour. You can't just \"feel out\" how much sugar to add to the batter, or how long to whisk the batter so the eggs don't get overbeaten and rubberize the mixture.\nSo, finally, after four unsuccessful attempts at good pancakes in four weeks, I pulled out my Cooking A-Z and looked up the blueprints for basic pancakes. I promised to follow the instructions to the letter. Except that I was so confident in the awesomeness of the pancakes that were about to be served up to my starving daughter that I got a little fancy and chopped up a banana to add. Banana pancakes. Because if her dad really loved her he'd man up and put fruit in it.\nMix, chop, whisk, pour, sizzle. Oh wow. Those look amazing. They are fluffing up perfectly. I'm going to turn them now. Oh, look at that, they are perfectly golden brown. Take them from the pan. Cut one up a little for Erin. Taste.\nTaste. What the hell? Why do they taste so weird?\nRecheck the blueprints.\nBaking powder? Check.\n1/4 cup of sugar? Che.....\nOh. I don't actually keep sugar in the small white jar on the counter. I keep it in the medium white jar on the counter.\nI keep salt in the small white jar.\nDammit. 1/4 cup of salt in my batter. I lose at baking.\nEmily suggests I buy the pre-mixed Bisquick jug, since I've now ruined 5 batches of batter in a little less than a month. But even though this last batch proves that the pancakes aren't to blame, that I am just completely incompetent when it comes to making pancakes, I will persevere.\nI will become the best damn pancake batter maker around.\nBecause breakfast should be something more than nuked eggs and a peeled banana.", "id": "<urn:uuid:298ae1b4-5c0c-4baf-aa7d-968ffd5178c7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://backpackingdad.blogspot.com/2008/08/here-here-are-keys-to-my-kitchen-take.html?showComment=1218217200000", "date": "2013-05-18T05:23:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9625734090805054, "token_count": 909, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "To first make sure we're on the same page, here's how peer review works today. You write a manuscript and submit it to a journal, where it is assigned to an editor. Exactly what happens then depends somewhat on the journal. In some cases the editors sort out a lot of submissions already at this stage. At very high impact journals like Science and Nature, editors reject the vast majority of papers not because they're wrong but because they're not deemed relevant enough, but these journals are exceptions. In the general case, your manuscript will be assigned a number and be sent to one or several of your colleagues who (are thought to) work on related topics and who are asked to write a report on your paper. That's the peer review.\nThe assignment of people to your paper doesn't always work too great, so they have a chance to decline and suggest somebody else. At least in my experience in most cases the manuscript will be sent to two people. Some journals settle on one, some do three. In some cases they might opt for an additional report later on. In any case, the reviewers are typically asked for a written assessment of the manuscript, that's the most important part. They are also asked whether the manuscript is suitable for that particular journal. And typically they'll have to judge the manuscript on a 5 point scale on how interesting the content/good the presentation is etc. Finally, they'll have to make a recommendation on whether the paper is suitable for publication in the present form, whether revisions should be done, have to be done, or whether it's not suitable for publication. The reviewer's judgement is anonymous. The author does not generally know who they are. (That's the default. There is in principle nothing prohibiting the reviewer from contacting the author directly, but few do that. And in some cases it's just easy to guess who wrote a report.)\nIn most cases the report will say say revisions have to be done. You then revise the paper, reply to the queries and resubmit. The exchange is mediated by the editor and can go back and forth several times, though most journals keep this process to a few resubmissions only. The whole procedure can take anything between a few weeks and several years. In the end your paper might get rejected anyway. While in some cases one learns something from the reports, the process is mostly time-consuming and frustrating. The final decision on your manuscript is made by the editor. They will generally, but not always, follow the advice of the reports.\nOn the practical side, the manuscript- and review-submission is typically done through a web interface. Every publisher has their own labyrinth of usernames, passwords, access codes, manuscript-, article tracking-, and other -numbers. The most confusing part for me is that some journals assign different author and reviewer accounts to the same person. I typically write reports on one or two papers per month. That's more than ten times the number of manuscripts I submit. There are very few journals who pay reviewers for their report. JHEP announced some while back they would. Most people do it as a community service.\nThere are several well-known problems with this procedure. Most commonly bemoaned is that since the reviewers are anonymous they might abuse the report to their own advantage. That might be in the form of recommending the author cites the reviewer's papers (you're well advised to do that). In the worst case they might reject a paper not because they found a mistake but because it's incompatible with their own convictions. One can decline to review a paper in this case due to \"conflict of interest,\" but well. We have all conflicting interests, otherwise we'd all be doing the same thing. What happens more often though is that the reviewer didn't read or at least not think about the paper and writes a sloppy report that might accept a wrong or decline a right paper mistakenly.\nI have written many times that the way to address these community-based problems - to the extend it's possible - is to make sure researchers' sole concern is the advancement of science and not other sorts of financial pressure, public pressure or time pressure that might make it seem smart to down-thumb competitors. But that's not the aspect I want to focus on here.\nInstead I want to focus here on the practical problems. One is that the exchange between the author and the reviewers is unnecessary slow and cumbersome. Submitting a written report and having it passed on by the editor must be a relic from the times when such a report was carved in stone and shipped across the ocean. It would be vastly preferable if journals would instead provide an online interface to communicate with the author that preserves the anonymity of the reviewer. This would allow the reviewer to ask some quick, clarifying questions and not only make their task easier, but also prevent misunderstandings. Typically, if the reviewer has misunderstood something in your manuscript you have to do a lot of tip-toeing to tell them they're wrong without telling them they're wrong because, you see, the editor is reading every word and knows who they are. The idea isn't that such a communication interface should replace the report, just that it could accompany the review process and that a written report is submitted after some determined amount of time.\nAnother practical problem with today's peer review process is that when your paper gets rejected and you submit it to another journal, you have to start all over again. This multiplies efforts on both, the authors' and the reviewers', sides. This is one of the reasons why I'm suggesting to decouple the peer review process from the journals. The idea is simply that the author would submit their manuscript not for publication to a journal, but first to some independent agency to obtain a report (or several). This report would then be submitted with the manuscript to the journal. The journal will still have to assess whether the manuscript is suitable for this particular journal, but the point is that the author has a stamp of legitimacy independent from a journal reference. It's up to the author then what to do with the report. You could for example just use the report (in some summarized form) with an arxiv upload.\nThere could be several of such peer review agencies, and they might operate differently. Eg some might pay the reviewer, some might not. Some might ask for a fee, some might not. One would see which works best. In the long run I would expect the reports' relevance to depend on the reputation of the agency.\nThis would address several problems at once. One is the by the open-access movement frequently criticized \"power of journals.\" That's because in many, if not most, fields a journal reference is still considered a sign of quality of your work. But journal subscriptions are very costly, and thus the pressure to publish in journals often means scientific studies are not freely accessible for the public. The reason is simply that today subscription journals are the main providers of peer review. But there is actually no reason for this connection. Decoupling publication from the review process would remove that problem. It would also address the above mentioned problem that when your manuscript gets rejected from one journal you have to start all over again with the peer review. Finally, it would add more diversity to the procedure in that the reviewers and authors could chose which agency suits them best. For example, some might have an anonymous, and some an open review process. Time would tell which in the end is more credible.\nThere is the question of financing of course. Again, there could be several models for that. As I've said many times before, I think if it's a public service, it should be financed like a public service. That is to say, since peer review is so essential to scientific progress, such peer review agencies should be eligible to apply for governmental funding. One would hope though that, as today, most of the time and effort would be carried by the researchers themselves as a community service.", "id": "<urn:uuid:bba56f0c-8fd6-4b59-a1f8-0d239b752452>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2010/04/peer-review-vi.html?showComment=1270558561950", "date": "2013-05-18T06:27:27Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9736339449882507, "token_count": 1623, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "|Commissioners put off decision on sand mines|\n|The Press - News|\n|Written by Mike Anderson|\n|Thursday, 21 June 2012 15:11|\nA jam-packed Baker County Commission meeting room on the evening of June 18 left no doubt where the vast majority of people in attendance stood on two proposed sand mining proposals.\nThey wanted them buried and gone.\nIt didn’t seem to matter how safe or harmless to the environment the applicants promised the mining would be, nor that the mined areas eventually would be reclaimed. It also didn’t matter how much of an economic impact they claimed the operation would have in the county.\nMost of the approximately 80 people, many of whom had to stand during the proceedings because there were only 45 chairs in the room, were against the mining plans and urged county commissioners to side with them.\n“What is the actual benefit to the county?” asked Macclenny resident Pat Shannon, adding that the mining companies would use billions of gallons of water while only employing a handful of workers and adding a negligible amount to the county’s coffers in taxes.\n“It just doesn’t add up,” he said. “I’m concerned about whether my grandchildren and great-grandchildren will have enough water to drink. Water is a precious commodity and we can’t give that up.”\nAfter more than three hours of testimony from mining company officials and hearing from a parade of homeowners on the opposite side of the issue, county commissioners rejected a motion to deny the mining requests and postponed a final decision for two months.\nOld Castle Southern Group, a Tampa-based company, plans to mine 193 acres of a 437-acre tract it leases from DuPont east of SR 228 about two miles south of Interstate 10. The firm, which owns a road-paving company and a concrete plant, also has a contract to buy another 700 acres, which could extend the life of the proposed mine to 50 years.\nE.R. Jahna Industries Inc., a family-owned business in the Central Florida town of Lake Wales, leases 960 acres owned by TerraPoint LLC, a subsidiary of Rayonier, just north of three residential subdivisions off US 90 at Trailridge. There, Jahna plans to mine coarse sand used to make siding, concrete blocks, stucco and other products.\nDuring a public hearing that began about 6:30 pm and didn’t end until just after 10 pm, others expressed similar views that the proposed deal would be slanted too much in favor of the mining companies.\n“The return is not there for the people of Baker County,” said Kirk Schiner of Shelly Lane, adding that drinking water is “not a never-ending supply.”\n“We need good air and good water to survive,” Richard Cooper of Elvin Starling Road said. “If you want to pass this, how about a tax per ton of sand that they want to take out of here?”\nThen, turning his attention to a group of Old Castle representatives seated in the audience, Mr. Cooper said, “You can’t reclaim the land because you’ve hauled it all off.”\nAnother critic was Allison Broughton, a former member of the county’s Land Planning Agency, which recently recommended approval of the two mining applications. She spoke against the measures as zealously as she fought a recent attempt by another company to obtain a zoning exception to build a medical waste incinerator north of the Walmart Distribution Center.\n“It has a negative impact on our entire county,” Mrs. Broughton said of the proposed mining plan. “I don’t think there‘s any doubt about that. A handful of jobs is not worth the depletion of our natural resources. We gain almost nothing by allowing these mines to come in.”\nShe said she had nothing personal against any of the company officials or representatives present at the hearing, whom she looked at when she described them as “out-of-town business people.”\n“They don’t live here,” said Mrs. Broughton.\nPlans submitted by the two mining companies assert the sites will not produce any air pollution and they will be buffered by trees and vegetation to minimize noise and keep their operations out of sight.\nThey also said the mines, which use floating electric-powered hydraulic dredges, extract water from deep in the Floridan Aquifer and would have no impact on private wells, which draw water from shallower portions of the aquifer that are not affected by water withdrawals from deeper levels.\n“We’re willing to spend more money to go to an aquifer that is not used in this county,” said Old Castle consultant Mark Stephens, a geologist and engineer from Lakeland. He said the company plans to drill 1,200 feet deep to draw water from the lower aquifer.\nDuring the first five years, Mr. Stephens said, about 3.5 billion gallons of water would be extracted from the aquifer, after which the amount of water withdrawn from underground would drop sharply because by that time the previously withdrawn water can be reused to continue daily operations.\nNonetheless, Macclenny City Manager Gerald Dopson urged commissioners to proceed cautiously.\n“We feel these mining proposals will be in the area of influence of our well fields,” he said of the municipal water supply of drinking water to thousands of city residents and dozens of businesses.\nMr. Dopson echoed the comments of many others who spoke during the hearing when he stressed his “real concerns” about the Floridan Aquifer and how the underground water supply might be adversely impacted by the mining operations.\n“We want to be very protective of our water supply,” Mr. Dopson said. “They (mining companies) want to make money, and there’s nothing wrong with making money. But are they making money at the expense of the rest of the county?”\nThe city pumps about 1 million gallons of water per day and distributes it to residential and commercial customers. As the city grows in the decades ahead, Mr. Dopson said, it wants to be able to continue meeting the drinking water needs of its citizens.\nManager Dopson then read a prepared statement into the record:\n“The special exceptions, if granted, should be issued for a maximum of … two years subject to the facilities providing site specific lithological and hydro geologic data including aquifer performance testing for review.\n“The special exception should also include specific language allowing the county to terminate the special exception in the event that mining operations result in adverse impacts to the city’s well fields and other existing infrastructure or the environment.”\nWyman Duggan, a Jacksonville attorney representing Old Castle Southern Group, said engineering models indicate the mining operation after 20 years would only cause a “total drawdown of one-third of an inch” at the nearest city well about 2.5 miles away.\nHe further said sand mining has been done successfully for many years with no problems and did not anticipate any problems here.\n“Sand mining is well established in Florida,” Mr. Duggan said. “It’s not a new industry. Mining and mineral extraction are encouraged by your (county) comprehensive plan. Mining is not new to the county and not new to this property.”\nIndeed, DuPont has been mining on hundreds of acres in the southeastern portion of Baker County for many years. Describing Old Castle’s request for a special zoning exception as a “housekeeping matter,” Mr. Duggan said it should be approved as a routine measure.\n“Mining and mineral extraction are encouraged by your (county) comprehensive plan,” he told commissioners.\nMr. Duggan asked commissioners to not be swayed by the emotional arguments critics made, but to consider the scientific evidence that shows no adverse impact on the environment from sand mining. He also pointed out that the company’s plans meet all the requirements needed in the county’s land development and zoning code to seek a special exception permit for a mine.\n“They’re speaking from the heart,” he said about the residents voicing their fears and concerns. “They care about their community. But you’re not here to do the will of the people. You’re here to apply the law.”\nIf the county approves the mining proposals they will be contingent on the owners’ obtaining permits from federal and state agencies, including the US Army Corps of Engineers, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Florida Wildlife Commission and St. Johns River Water Management District, which controls water withdrawals.\nThe water management district is presently reviewing the mining plans and is expected to release its findings in the next couple of months. Without the agency‘s approval, the mining plans would go no further.\n“This boils down to whether we can trust the water management district to do their job,” Commissioner Adam Giddens said. “I’d like to think we can.”\nCommissioner Mark Hartley, however, expressed concerns about how the proposed mining operations might affect nearby wetlands and the Floridan Aquifer. He said he didn’t see an upside to the equation.\n“I don’t think it can have a positive effect on the county,” Mr. Hartley said.\nA few minutes later he made a motion to deny the mining petition and after a pause of several seconds Commissioner Giddens seconded the motion. But when Chairman Gordon Crews called for a vote, Mr. Hartley was the only one who voted in favor of his own motion, which failed 4-1.\nShortly afterward, commissioners voted to continue the hearing on August 20, or possibly earlier if the water management district renders its decision before then.\nMeanwhile, mining company officials agreed to pay for the county to hire an independent hydro geologist to review the plans and render an unbiased opinion as to whether the scientific data furnished by the applicants is accurate and reliable.\n|Last Updated on Friday, 20 July 2012 12:48|", "id": "<urn:uuid:88de962a-7522-4852-8aff-bd60e40da76d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bakercountypress.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2023:commissioners-put-off-decision-on-sand-mines&catid=59:news&Itemid=57", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:43Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9625548720359802, "token_count": 2143, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Fisheries regulators voted Wednesday to reduce by more than one-third the harvest of menhaden, a small fish that plays a big ecological role in the health of the Chesapeake Bay and the fish that swim in its waters.\nMeeting in Boston, the menhaden board of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted to cut the annual harvest by 37 percent, according to calculations by the Pew Environmental Group. The new harvest limit, which is subject to a vote by the full commission in one year, would be effective in 2013.\nApproximately 460 million pounds of Atlantic menhaden were caught in 2010, primarily by trawlers that scoop up the fish in nets in the bay and along portions of the coast. Lobstermen in Maine and Massachusetts and bay crabbers also use the oily fish to bait their traps.\nEnvironmentalists, scientists and sports fishermen have lobbied for years for the more stringent catch limits. The forage species is eaten by prized game fish such as striped bass, or rock fish, and filters the Chesapeake Bay, improving its water quality.\n“They did the right thing today,” said Peter Baker of the Pew Group. “I think they heard the public loud and clear.”\nThe commission held 13 public hearings on menhaden and received nearly 92,000 comments, the vast majority seeking to limit the harvest. The reduced catch is intended to allow menhaden stocks to rebound.\nThe lower catch limit could be felt the hardest in Reedville, Va., home to a menhaden fleet that has made the tiny bay town the No. 2 fishing port by weight in the U.S. More than 400 million pounds of the menhaden were hauled in last year by Omega Protein Inc. trawlers.\nOmega processes the catch into Omega-3 capsules popular among Americans for the fish oil’s vaunted health benefits. It is also used in an array of food and commercial products, from feed for swine, poultry and cattle and to meal for fish farms.\nOmega spokesman Ben Landry said a new stock assessment was due within the next year. “There’ll be a lot of new data presented to the board over the next year and hopefully the population will improve,” he said.\nOmega, a Houston company that also operates a menhaden fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, employs about 300 people at its Reedville plant during the May-to-December season. The company has said limits could trigger job reductions.\n“I think we’re going to have to take a real close look at our current operations to see how it’s going to be affected,” Landry\nsaid, stopping short of saying there would be job cuts.\nMenhaden, pudgy fish that typically are less than 1-foot in length, have no value as a food fish. But the fish so coveted by Americans as a dietary supplement is also a primary source of nourishment for sea life and birds.\n“That same Omega-3 fatty acid is really important for fish that eat menhaden and the other animals that eat menhaden,” said Baker, director of Pew’s northeast fisheries. “It’s the most nutritious food that they can eat.”\nScientists have linked lower weights in stripers to declines in menhaden.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation called the vote a victory for the coastal ecosystem and the fish that feast on menhaden.\n“This is great news for jobs, for our economy and for a society that values wildlife,” said Will Baker, president of the\nMaryland Gov. Martin O’Malley praised fisheries regulators for their actions.\n“The new, more conservative fishing threshold and target are significant steps in ensuring a sustainable future for menhaden, an essential food source for striped bass, bluefish, dolphins, osprey and bald eagles and other fish and wildlife species,” he said in a statement.\nVast schools of menhaden used to range from Maine to Florida, supporting a thriving fishery along the coast. Omega is the last so-called “reduction” fishery along the Atlantic.\n“The abundance of menhaden and the number of menhaden in the water, over the last 30 years, has been reduced by more than 80 percent,” Baker said. He called the vote a “watershed moment.”\n(Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press.

{"text": "Sometimes, we at the Band know that part of owning who you are is admitting it to the world. It's one reason why we at The Band work tirelessly to break down stigmas and find the ties that connect us all, the ties that remind us that we are none of us alone.\nPlease join us in standing tall and proud as we tell the world who we are.\nWhat are you, The Band, The Face Of?\nI am fairly open, I am aware that the only way people are going to understand various things is to have people speak out about them to be the face of them.\nI am fine being the face of things; I proudly wear my labels as an ACOA, rape/incest survivor, special needs parent, non-traditional student, and self-injurer. But, I have spent years hiding, pretty well denying, a label that I should be wearing. It's a label that gives me butterflies as I sit here getting ready to type it.\nI am, in no uncertain terms, an addict. Yet, when asked what I am the face of or talking about me and my past I never use that term. In fact, I often comment on how my family has history (a strong history of) addiction, I just fail to mention I am part of that history.\nBut, I can't hide it any longer. And I am not even sure why I hide it; I mean I know why, I am scared of what people will think and say. But, why? I am not ashamed or worried about anything else in my past, though a lot of the dumb things I chose to do occurred or were a result of not being sober.\nI spent much of my youth from about 14-15 using pain medication and alcohol. I mean pain medication was easy to get because I was an active kid who was prone to injury. I often went to the doc for an injury and they would write me a script. While I took them \"as prescribed\" I would take them too long when I actually no longer needed them.\nI would find a way to get different medication so I could \"alternate\" and maintain the high longer. I would toss in alcohol when I could because my parents were open about alcohol, that it wasn't taboo. My parents didn't know about a lot of the drinking that occurred nor the extent to which it happened.\nIt made me numb, I made dumb decisions on it. I hurt myself and others, but I still doubt that many people of my youth realize what I was doing. After all most addicts are good at manipulating the situation.\nYet, still this label has been one I denied and disowned which in the long run did as much harm to me and my psyche as if I had denied my own left arm. Because this label, being an addict, is as much a part of me as my left arm.\nWhat baffles me is when a friend slips or enters recovery I am the first to be there. Never saying a word about my issues, I offer to go to meetings and have a \"safe space\" at my home. All the while biting my tongue and not finding the camaraderie I could have, should have.\nSo, what brought me to the point of revealing this layer? Well, I slipped and fell HARD this week. We have been having lots of struggles, mostly financial, and this isn't an excuse just a telling of the events. I ran out of coping skills, ultimately that is what happened, I ran out of fucking coping skills.\nI started popping again, finding a way to take the pain medication every hour. Never letting my feet touch the ground, so to speak, for about a week. I would pull into work and start calculating when I could leave and get home to take another pill. I would take a pill and immediately look at the clock and figure out when I could take another. This whole time rationalizing that I was \"taking it as prescribed.\" Technically I wasn't taking any more pills than what the bottle said, never mind I wasn't in pain.\nI finally told hubby two nights ago that I snuck a pill in yesterday morning, then he made them disappear (honestly, I wasn't here so I have no idea about the disappearance--other than I asked him to get them someplace I don't know of) and bought me pomegranate juice, which I love. I still have been holding close to my secret.\nUltimately I chose to peel open this layer because I can no longer be silent, because the silence is killing me. It's allowing my illness to fester and then allows it to be fed. And I know that's not okay. I need a support network more now then ever, one that I know \"in person\" doesn't exist but one that I know I have here \"online\" and far away.\nI know many of my friends will recoil, wondering how it could be. I don't know how or why, I just know it is. I just know I can't go on denying such a huge part of me. I need to find the fellowship, I need to be able to reach out when I am falling down that black hole. I need help figuring out what this means for me, my life, and how this slip is going to color my world from now on.\nI have a friend with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).\nMy mom has it too.\nRA is an invisible illness. People with invisible illnesses have no visible symptoms, so many folks don't understand why they can't do all the things that most people can do. There is some sort of spoon theory that they use to try to explain it; long story short, people with these invisible illnesses only have so many spoons to get through each day. They have to think about how they are going to use each spoon because they can't go get more spoons at the spoon store, and I can't give my mom or my friend some of my spoons to get through the day.\nI found out my friend was thinking of a project involving spoons; she's real crafty and creative like that. I made it my mission in life to go find my friend lots of random spoons. I went to the local flea market hoping to find some spoons. I found a bunch of random spoons and bought lots of them for my friend's project. This made me happy.\nThen, I got sad. I was sad because I can't give my friend any of my metaphysical spoons, even though I often have more than I need to get through my day. I would gladly give up some of my spoons for my friend or my mom, but I can't. That isn't how spoon theory works. Maybe some day, science will have the answer to that conundrum, but right now that is still \"fringe science\"; I get enough fringe science from my Sunshine, as he studies the neurophysiology of addiction.\nI sat and thought about spoons, and I was sad that I can't give my spoons to those who need them. Then I had a moment of extreme giddiness over the saying we have in recovery about how \"spoons are for stirring coffee.\" This is especially funny to addicts, because we have some insane uses for spoons.\nThen I remembered that movie The Matrix. There is no spoon. This has the potential to take me down the paths of fringe science, but I get enough of that from Sunshine.\nSo rather than be sad about not being able to share my metaphysical spoons, or travel down the path of fringe science, I went shopping.\nI went to an antique shop, and I bought some spoons. I bought some really neat, rather fancy, really random spoons. They are my gift to my friend.\nSee, I sat in a meeting last night with other recovering addicts, and I realized that the fellowship is all about the therapeutic value of one addict helping another. We addicts share our experience, strength, and hope with one another. We share our metaphysical spoons.\nWhile I may not have an invisible illness that leaves me debilitated on some days, I do have a disease that can't exactly be seen. The treatment for my disease involves sitting around with other recovering addicts and sharing our spoons with one another.\nWhile it may not help my friend get through her day better (physically) for me to send her some fancy antique spoons, I know that it will make her heart smile, and that's what helps her get through the bad days - just like another addict's experience, strength, and hope helped me get clean.\nToday, y'all are part of my circle of recovery. Y'all share y'all's spoons with me, and that's some awesome shit.\nAnd until fringe science catches up with us, we'll keep stumbling along the best we can. And I'll keep buying up random spoons for my friend.\nI spent a lot of years in active addiction, wearing yesterday's clothes and grime. When I first got clean, I did a lot of dressing up so that the outside looked good, in hopes that you wouldn't see past the facade to realize that the inside was a fucked-up, shitty mess.\nToday my outside is more of a reflection of what's going on inside. I feel whole, I feel worthwhile, and I feel good, therefore I try to look good.\nThere's something to be said about the feel of a well-made cashmere sweater or pair of silk sweatpants, or even an uber-comfortable cotton t-shirt that fits like it was made for me. There's just something nice about wearing fancy pants and fancy shoes to go grocery shopping. I lived too long in the filth and desperation of addiction to deny myself some little luxuries today.\nNow, looking good doesn't have to be expensive. Yes, I wear a lot of high-end brands because I'm worth it, but here's a secret--I never pay full price. There is something thrilling about finding a pair of Armani pants on a clearance rack for $25 (yes, it happens). Must be endorphins, because it's quite pleasant like a good buzz.\nWell, today I am riding one serious endorphin-based high. I got new shoes. Not just any new shoes. Jimmy Choo shoes. Nude patent leather sandals on cork platform wedges. Brand New In Box. For $85. And? They feel really good on my feet--great arch support, heel and ball of foot cushioning, and light as feathers. My first pair of Jimmy Choo shoes!\nTell me that's not a dose of happy.\nHere at The Band, we believe in kicking stigmas to the curb, flinging glitter, and shining a light into the dark. And now?\nYour bandmate needs a sounding board.\nIt's time to Ask The Band!\nI quit drinking seven months ago.\nActually, it was 217 days ago if you want to get specific.\nI wasn't a fall down drunk all the time. I reserved my drinking for the evenings and the weekends. I usually waited until my child was in bed. I usually drank with other people.\nI graduated both high school and college with honors, all while drinking. People knew I attended classes hungover but no one ever said I had a problem. I have successfully held down jobs all while drinking. I had more than my fair share of liquid lunches and still managed to not get fired. My happy hours after work went on too long and by sheer luck I never hurt myself or someone else or had a run in with the law.\nI stopped drinking when I found out I was pregnant. As soon as I was done nursing I started drinking again. I was sober for about a year. Aside of that year, I hadn't been sober that long since I was 14 years old.\nLast summer, I made a complete ass of myself with my drinking.\nI took risks I shouldn't have. I drank alone often. Most mornings I'd think about how long it would be until I could drink again. I'd wonder if I could drink during the day and be okay to pick my son up from day care. I came dangerously close to drinking at lunch. I arranged sitters so that I could drink to excess and not have to worry about parenting getting in the way.\nI started to scare myself.\nI thought about drinking and wanted to be drunk all the time. The only thing that stopped me is the shame of everyone finding out that I'm an alcoholic. I can barely type those words; I have yet to say them out loud to anyone. But it is who I am and it was getting really hard to keep hiding it.\nSo I quit drinking. Cold turkey. Just like that.\nBut I miss it.\nI miss being drunk. I don't know if I can do this for the rest of my life. I want to drink so badly tonight it hurts.\nI don't know how to live sober.\nI'm afraid to tell people just how bad my drinking was because they will think I'm a bad mother, a bad person. Or they won't believe me because I seem put together. Or I'll be held accountable and be judged if I slip.\nAnd I really, really feel like I'm going to slip.\nI thought I'd be less scared of myself if I got sober.\nWhy am I still so scared?\nWhen is this going to get easier?\nAlcoholism can completely change a loved one's personality and put stress on the entire family as a result.\nThis is her story.\nLife's not fair, I know that. I don't expect fairness from the world at large. But I feel like - and maybe this is me being a spoiled only child - we should try to be fair to those we supposedly love.\nHe's an alcoholic, I know that too. He tells me so all the time, whenever I complain about his behavior or his attitude. Or whenever he feels bad. He's trying to fight his demons, he says.\nBut I'm angry. I'm supposed to be the bigger person and I am so fucking angry.\nWe made a decision about today's schedule last night. Last night when he was perfectly sober, I must add. Today I followed that schedule and it turns out he is mad that I did. He feels like I left him out, even though that's what we decided last night.\nBut I'm the bitch. I'm starting the fight, because I wanted to know why he'd called me so angry. He is mad that his family wasn't there when he woke up.\nThe decision wasn't even 12 hours old, but he changed his mind and is resentful that I didn't know that, that I didn't follow his new wishes.\nI fucking hate that. I hate not being able to make plans, not even 12 hours in advance, because he doesn't know what kind of mood he'll be in. He might change his mind and he will be a resentful fucking child if he's committed to something and then changed his mind about it. Or he'll be mad at us if we've gone somewhere without him, because he told me he wanted to sleep late.\nI don't feel like I have a partner, I feel like I'm being bossed around by a petulant child.\nI know that he is hurting. I know that he is trying to get better. I know that in a few hours, he will be my real husband for a while - the one who doesn't act like a petulant child. But then nighttime will come, he will have his five drinks after the kids go to bed - and he will be perfectly nice at that time too - and then in the morning he will be an asshole.\nIt's like I live with two people and one of them is a total dick. We can't afford counseling, rehab, or to live apart, really. I don't even know what's actually wrong with us. Are other men so resentful if they don't get to wake up whenever they choose? I know he has insomnia, which is his reason for drinking, but it just seems weird for someone in his thirties.\nHe gets resentful if I'm not available for sex whenever he wakes up, but he's also resentful if I wake him up early to have sex before I have stuff to do. He's resentful whenever I'm on the computer, but that's a big source of our income right now.\nIt's like he doesn't know how to be a grownup anymore.\nPage 1 of 24", "id": "<urn:uuid:2a5d2ff4-06c7-4cc2-968a-3a7a8031ed9b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bandbacktogether.com/category/addiction/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:49:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9845542311668396, "token_count": 3469, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "HOWLAND, Maine — Foxcroft Academy crowned eight individual champions to pull away to victory Saturday at the Eastern Maine Class C wrestling championships held at Penobscot Valley High School.\nThe defending state champion Ponies totaled 249.5 points to best runner-up Dexter (195). Fort Kent was third with 85.5 points, with Mattanawcook Academy of Lincoln (69) and Piscataquis of Guilford (60) rounding out the top five.\nFoxcroft qualified wrestlers in all 14 weight classes for next Saturday’s state championship meet to be held at Fryeburg Academy, while Dexter advanced 13 qualifiers.\nFoxcroft — which edged Dexter by a single point to win last week’s Penobscot Valley Conference meet — led Dexter by 23 points entering the championship finals, with the Ponies still having 11 wrestlers alive while the Tigers had 10.\n“It felt like a dual meet out there with all the Foxcroft wrestlers on one side and all the Dexter wrestlers on the other side,” said Foxcroft coach Luis Ayala, who teaches at Dexter. “Dexter and Foxcroft have always had a great rivalry, and you could really feel it out there. Every match was hard fought, and the crowd was going wild.”\nDexter immediately narrowed the gap with championship-match victories by Dylan Hanscom at 106 pounds, Tyler Salsbury at 113 and Aaron Webber at 126 — with two of those victories coming against opponents from Foxcroft.\nSix other head-to-head matchups remained, and Foxcroft won all of them.\nTrevor Weymouth (132), Forrest Law (138), Wesley Stinson (145), Corey Bjornson (182), Corbyn Bruce (195) and Alex Sedore (285) all won their individual regional titles by defeating Dexter rivals in the finals.\nTodd Francis (152) and Zac Smith (170) also won championships for the Ponies.\nFoxcroft got second-place efforts from Brooks Law (113), Isaac Whittemore (126) and Damien Small (220), thirds from Eli Olson (106) and Mark Smith (120) and a fourth from Dylan Bruce at 160.\nDexter crowned four champions in Hanscom, Salsbury, Webber and Jon Gudroe (160).\nRunners-up for the Tigers were Seth Blais (132), Andrew Adams (138), Andrew Levensalor (145), Anthony McLaughlin (182), Josh Haskell (195) and Kyle Lockhart (285), while Vincent Malinauskas (152) and Carl Snow (170) each placed third and Devan Gudroe (120) finished fourth.\nOther Eastern Maine champions were Sam Thomas of Piscataquis of Guilford and Zac Ragot of Washington Academy of East Machias. Thomas avenged a loss to WA’s Chris Weiss in their PVC final with a 6-5 victory in the 120-pound final, while Ragot won the 220-pound crown.\nFort Kent was led by second-place finishes from Joshua Pelletier (152) and Brandon Hartt (170).\nDirigo captures ‘C’ West\nAt Bucksport, Dirigo of Dixfield qualified 13 of its 14 wrestlers for the state meet, including four first-place finishers, to win the Western C regional for the first time in four years.\nDirigo scored 194.5 points to best host Bucksport, which amassed 157.5 points in its debut season as a Western Maine program. Another new Western C team, Winslow, finished third with 122 points, while Madison (100) and Mount View of Thorndike (82) rounded out the top five.\nCaleb Hall (132), Brett Whittemore (138), Jesse Hutchinson (145) and Gavin Sanders (182) all won individual titles for Dirigo, which also had four second-place finishers, two thirds and three fourths on the day.\nBucksport, coming off a third-place finish at last weekend’s PVC championships, had the most individual champions with six.\nFreshman Matthew Stewart was the 106-pound champion, while Jacob Stewart (152), Jordan Fogg (160), Nic Bishop (170), Chris Powell (195) and Damon Klinedinst (285) also won their weight classes for coach Larry Clement’s Golden Bucks.\nFive of the six Bucksport champions were top-seeded in their weight classes, while Bishop was a third seed in his return from a recent knee injury that had sidelined him for last week’s PVC meet.\nSenior Alex Brown, seeded second at 120 pounds, finished second in that weight class to give Bucksport a seventh qualifier for the state meet.\nMt. Blue prevails in EM ‘A’\nAt Westbrook, Mt. Blue won its second straight Eastern A championship, avenging a loss to Cony of Augusta in last week’s KVAC Class A meet to defeat the second-place Rams 168.5 to 138.\nSkowhegan was third with 135.5 points, with Westbrook (96), Windham (92) and Brewer (87) rounding out the top six teams.\nBrewer’s effort featured a victory in the 285-pound class by Marcus Eaton. Eaton, second in his weight class at last year’s state championship meet, won his second straight Eastern A title by pinning Cony’s Steven Morse at 1:39 of the final.\nThe Witches also got second-place finishes from Mark Smith (120 pounds), Anthony Sprigg (132) and Victor Irwin (195) and a fourth from Robbie Kiah at 145.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4010c256-2632-4a67-b656-71dbe6ccbd46>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2012/02/12/sports/wrestling/foxcroft-uses-depth-to-win-eastern-c-dirigo-prevails-in-western-c/?ref=relatedBox", "date": "2013-05-18T05:31:42Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9438833594322205, "token_count": 1179, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "AUGUSTA, Maine — The Maine Labor Relations Board on Wednesday dismissed the latest complaint filed by the state’s largest public employees union against Gov. Paul LePage’s administration related to bitter contract negotiations dating to last year.\nThe Maine State Employees Association filed the complaint Tuesday requesting that the LePage administration stop hiring private contractors to do work typically handled by the union.\nThe 16-page document alleges that the state is bound by contract to negotiate with the union before it hires nonmembers. The union said in its complaint that the practice deprives “bargaining unit members of that work, as well as the pay and benefits that come with that work.”\nMaine law requires the state to maintain the status quo after a contract expires, which is currently the case with the MSEA. That effectively means that the state can continue to contract out or reorganize its work force to make government more efficient and effective, according to the board.\nThe complaint was dismissed because it failed to state a valid claim under the State Employees Labor Relations Act.\n“Once again, the Maine Labor Relations Board has thrown out an unfounded complaint by this union,” John McGough, LePage’s chief of staff, said in a statement. “MSEA is desperate to find an issue to fight Governor LePage on, and this is another failed attempt to find one with any legal footing.”\nThe LePage administration and the MSEA, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, have been embroiled in contract negotiations that date to early last year.\nStill pending before the Maine Labor Relations Board is a complaint by the MSEA that the administration has acted in bad faith during negotiations, which still have not resulted in a new collective bargaining agreement.\nMSEA staff said in a statement Wednesday that the state board’s dismissal of the most recent complaint was expected but it should help expedite resolution of their pending complaint.\nLePage and some allies have targeted unions — both public sector and private sector — since the Republican governor has taken office.\nAlthough unsuccessful so far on measures that would prohibit unions from requiring dues to be collected from nonunion members, the administration has made some progress on labor issues.\nThe House and Senate recently approved a bill from the governor’s office that would strip the ability of independent child care providers to unionize and collectively bargain. Another bill that bans workers at the former Decoster Farm in Turner from unionizing also has won legislative approval.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "id": "<urn:uuid:eb20c8e0-a7e1-4fab-bc41-3582b3d97236>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2012/04/11/politics/maine-state-workers-union-files-complaint-against-lepage-administration/?ref=relatedBox", "date": "2013-05-18T06:31:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9638296365737915, "token_count": 520, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

For quite a while now I've left the unit plugged into the wall with the USB cable attached, and have just attached the iPod to the cable every now and then to charge it up.

{"text": "Effective leaders pay attention to structure and organization to insure the structure continues to benefit the organization’s mission. Read Deuteronomy 1:1-15.\nThe universe has overwhelming evidence of God’s use of structure and organization in the intelligent design of creation. Even the simplest living organism is more complex and subtle than the most sophisticated computer. The Bible gives insight into God’s instructions concerning structure and organization to Moses, the leader He chose to lead His people from a time of slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land. When carrying total responsibility for leadership of the people of Israel overwhelmed Moses, God encouraged him to change the organizational structure so as to channel more of Israel’s human resources to fulfill the leadership needs. Wisely Moses accepted God’s counsel.\nEffective leaders create structure that addresses the methods by which resources flow through the organization to accomplish work. Read Numbers 11:1-35.\nWhen Moses couldn’t handle all of the responsibilities of leading Israel, God told him to enlist seventy qualified persons, empower them and allow them to help to carry the burden. Moses was overwhelmed and the people under-served so God took action. The existing system wasn’t working so He changed it. It wasn’t about “who’s the boss”, it was about who would serve the people.\nStructure and organization has a way of turning chaos into an effective use of resources. Read 1 Corinthians 14:40.\nThis verse, in a chapter on worship structure, furnishes a valuable glimpse into the public worship of the first-century churches. It stresses that order, structure, form, unity, like mindedness and mutual regard should prevail when believers gather together.\nWell-led organizations can accomplish more than any individual can hope to accomplish. Read Exodus 18:1-27.\nMoses was overwhelmed by the problems of leading a large number of people. Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, helped Moses to see that organization and structure are essential to effective operation. Not only is work accomplished more efficiently, but people are better served and supported in doing the work.\nEffective Christian leaders make long range plans and give God room to actively direct or change those plans. Read Romans 15:22-29.\nIn today’s verses the Apostle Paul is in process of taking a love offering from the churches in Macedonia to the church in Jerusalem that had fallen on hard times. While on his way to Jerusalem, Paul is writing to the Christians in Rome discussing some long range plans to visit their church on his way to preach the Gospel in Spain.", "id": "<urn:uuid:880ce9cd-f102-40a9-95f5-ea5910c9717c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://barrywerner.com/author/dcone/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9549376368522644, "token_count": 537, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Nursing a critically ill state back to health\n|Indranill Basu Ray highlights the core problems that afflict Bengal's health sector and suggests a few ways to improve the situation|\nDespite many technological and other achievements that have propelled India from being a developing nation to one of the top economies of the world, one field that India continues to lag behind in is health. This is why stories of babies dying in large numbers haunt newspaper headlines. India is behind Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in life expectancy at birth or under-five mortality level. India accounts for about 17 per cent of the world population, but it contribute to a fifth of the world's share of diseases. A third of all diarrhoeal diseases in the world occurs in India. The country has the second largest number of HIV/AIDS cases after South Africa. It is home to one-fifth of the world's population afflicted with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nA common excuse that I often hear is that we have limited resources to tackle the huge and burgeoning health problems. But even the richest country on earth, the United States of America, has failed to provide appropriate health services to a large section of the populace. The problem in India is quite different. Apart from being a poor nation with limited resources, it also has a sizeable population in need of basic health services. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate sanitary measures and education ensures an ever increasing presence of communicable disease that have been controlled and even eradicated in the developed nations.\nIndia's list of woes does not stop here. Lack of foresight on the part of successive governments and selective and fragmented strategies to counter daily problems without a definite public health goal have been the mainstay of India's health policies. Resource allocation to this sector is influenced by the prevailing fiscal situation as well as by the priorities of the reigning government. Unfortunately, in Bengal — a state that faces a dismal fiscal situation — the government's priorities have been skewed as a result of political necessities. Although we have a new government at the helm, it is important to realize that gross changes at the practical level cannot be initiated without having a team with experience and knowledge define a well-thought-out strategy. It is also essential to have a government that is willing to fulfil the financial needs necessary for the strategy to work.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to paint a picture of the present state of public health in West Bengal and to suggest measures to rectify the same in a short article like this. My intention is to highlight the core problems plaguing the system and to suggest solutions based on accepted principles of public health and healthcare management. The steps that need to be taken are as follows: reducing disease burden, including infectious diseases as well as non-communicable epidemics like diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; restructuring the existing primary healthcare system to make it more accountable; creating a skilled and professional workforce which is quality driven; financial planning to bring more investment to the health sector.\nReducing disease burden is the cornerstone of any good health policy. The factors that help reduce communicable diseases are clean drinking water, improved sanitation and an effective vaccination programme. A paradigm shift, from the prevalent curative approach to a preventive approach, including health promotion by inculcating behavioural changes, is imperative to reduce disease burden. West Bengal is one of four states that urgently needs high investment in safe drinking water and toilet facilities. It is estimated that Rs 18,000 crore is required to provide effective drinking water and sanitation facilities for the entire country. Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Odisha would account for more than 60 per cent of the total outlay.\nSimilarly, a huge investment is required to provide nutritional supplements to malnourished children and pregnant and lactating mothers living below the poverty line. According to a report by the national commission on macroeconomics and health, West Bengal would need to harness an additional resource requirement of rupees (in crore) 1,286, 2,459, 4,693, 13,811 and 8,485 in sectors such as health, water and sanitation, nutrition, primary schooling and roads. It has been projected that in the next five years West Bengal will spend a large portion of its revenues on wages and salaries, interest payments and pensions, leaving very little for discretionary expenditure in the field of health. It is imperative that the present government rethink and strategize in collaboration with the Centre to ensure the appropriate funding necessary to make the state healthy.\nRestructuring the present healthcare delivery system is also equally important. Most primary healthcare centres are old, dilapidated buildings with few or no facilities. Some do not even have basic resources like healthcare workers or pharmacists. What is required is a radical overhaul of the existing system. There are differences in health systems of different countries. A State-run health system, such as the one in Canada, suffers from delayed medical care. A privately-run health system like the one in the US provides only limited health services to its poor. India's healthcare should carve out the best of both systems. Private healthcare is thriving in India. It is uncontrolled and aimed at profit-making. Government-run hospitals are poorly managed, providing few or no facilities to those living below the poverty line.\nDifferent models have been suggested to take care of this disparity. While private investment will always be geared towards profit-making, it is mandatory to rein in these bodies under well-defined rules. Large private hospitals in the US are non-profit bodies, which have to follow stringent rules in patient care. At the other end of the spectrum is the National Health Service in Britain in which small, medium and even a few large hospitals are making way for a more competent and accountable government-controlled health system with fewer hospitals.\nHuman resource management is very important in running an effective health system. One of the biggest lacunae of government health service is its poor human-resource management. Many physicians are not paid appropriate salaries or are posted in places that are not of their choice. Political intervention and favouritism play a big role in posting physicians. Consequently, dedicated physicians who want to serve the public or work in the academic setting found in government hospitals are forced to remain in private hospitals. To boost morale and efficacy, discipline needs to be instituted in the system and a transparent posting policy adopted. The doctor-population ratio needs to be improved by filling up vacancies in the West Bengal health service. It is important to free postings from the grip of bureaucrats to ensure the registration of quality candidates. Physicians failing to report to duty or indulging in indiscipline must be punished. Doctors who do sign up need to provide relevant and quality medical care. This can only be done if some form of recertification of doctors is made mandatory once every 10 years. Physicians' salaries in the state health service must be made on a par with those of the Central government to make sure that it remains a lucrative option. Senior physicians providing exemplary public service must be rewarded for the same. A commonly-held notion is that most physicians run after the lucrative salaries that are offered in private hospitals. Hence it is difficult to retain them in the government sector. This, however, is true of a minority. The majority of physicians are willing to work in a healthy, progressive and academic environment if there are appropriate non-financial incentives. Let us take the example of Christian Medical College, Vellore. Most of the faculty there are paid salaries that are much lower than those of the private sector. However, physicians are provided with other facilities such as good housing, free schools, free-to-highly-subsidized college education and, most importantly, a progressive and research oriented work environment.\nWest Bengal lags behind many other states when it comes to medical education. There is an urgent need to increase the number of medical colleges in the state. Private investment for the same should be welcomed but appropriate laws must be instituted so that huge capitation fees are not charged for seats. Furthermore, selection should be made through competitive examinations. A certain percentage of seats can be reserved for the economically weaker sections. Students passing out of such medical colleges must be given postings in rural hospitals. This has been true on paper for many decades now, but the rule has been poorly implemented even in government-run medical colleges.\nInnovative schemes ought to be thought of to involve the cash-rich private sector to service the medical needs of the state. Private institutions using government money or land must be asked to provide free service to 20 per cent of their capacity. Appropriate punitive measures — such as temporarily withholding or cancelling licences — can be taken when a private institution fails to honour this commitment. Institutions willing to set up large hospitals, particularly around Calcutta, must be helped through the provision of low-cost land. But in return, promises to set up satellite hospitals in far-flung district headquarters have to be met.\nThe biggest challenge to the rejuvenation of the healthcare system is the garnering of funds. West Bengal is financially broke, thanks to the misrule of the communists. Unlike most other communist rulers, our home-grown variants failed to provide basic sanitation, good roads, a working healthcare system and appropriate nutritional supplements to women and children. The lack of social services resulted in poor health and in increased mortality among the vulnerable sections of society. Government efforts to improve basic health services must fund programmes that provide sanitation, nutritional supplements, and daily meals for school-going children. Substantial investments in these sectors can reduce mortality in children. It is popular to blame doctors for not being able to save severely ill, malnourished children. But things won't change unless determined steps are taken to root out the problems, such as poor funds, minimal resources and an incompetent workforce, that affect the West Bengal health service.\nIn the next five years, in collaboration with the Centre and the non-government organizations involved in public health, the state government must chalk out a definitive strategy to improve the supply of clean drinking water, provide better sanitation and one full meal to school-going children and arrange for nutritional supplements to pregnant women. Private investment should be wooed in the health sector to set up hospitals in large metropolitan areas as well as in small district towns. While government land is needed at an appropriate price to help investors build hospitals, steps must be taken to bring about the inclusion of the deprived sections in their service plans. Strong regulatory bodies that can monitor private hospitals and nursing homes must be instituted. Many of the profiteering health institutions do not provide basic facilities, lack trained nurses and paramedical staff, and some are even run by quacks without medical degrees. It is of utmost importance that a regulatory body conducts surprise checks on these institutions, registers complaints and takes remedial steps.\nMany NGOs have been able to set up large projects benefiting thousands of people. They have also succeeded in bringing foreign aid to tackle malaria and HIV. The state government should help these NGOs achieve their goals while exercising control to prevent financial irregularities. Their services ought to be applauded and single-window processing of applications instituted to help them tackle bureaucratic delays. Health is a service industry and not a lucrative business. Unfortunately, in Bengal, most large hospitals are owned by corporates. Only a few are owned or run by doctors. There is thus a sustained effort to make profit. Poor consumer protection makes the man on the street vulnerable to substandard service at high prices.\nThese are trying times for Bengal, after years of mismanagement in the health sector. It is important for the present rulers to rectify the situation by laying down the stepping stones for a better tomorrow.\nTuesday, November 22, 2011\nNursing a critically ill state back to health Indranill Basu Ray highlights the core problems that afflict Bengal’s health sector and suggests a few ways to improve the situation", "id": "<urn:uuid:a51737a0-6a1a-4721-a739-791f50bfecba>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://basantipurtimes.blogspot.com/2011/11/nursing-critically-ill-state-back-to.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:08:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9593021273612976, "token_count": 2399, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean"]}

Do you?\nToday Paul O'Neill, David Cone, Scott Brosius, Jeff Nelson, Jennifer Steinbrenner Swindal, and nearly 60 local high school kids helped move home plate, the pitchers mound, along with some dirt, from the old Yankee Stadium to the new stadium. Here's more from MLB.com:\nPaul O'Neill strode down a flight of concourse stairs at the new Yankee Stadium on Saturday, set his feet on the warning track -- a rough, dirt expanse, still studded with rocks and a few small puddles -- and took an exhaustive look around.\n\"Look at this joint, huh?\" he said.\nOut before him lay a baseball field, albeit an incomplete one, properly proportioned to match the dimensions of the old Yankee Stadium. Sod, with seams still showing, filled much of the area, and a large blue sign shouted the words \"YANKEE STADIUM\" from above center field. Waves of dark blue seats down the left-field line dumped into a still-unfinished section behind home plate, where metal supports hinted at where more seats are still to come.\nAnd on the mound, roughly 60 area children helped cram some dirt from the old Yankee Stadium into the new one.\n\"You know that the Yankees are going to do everything in a first-class manner, and this is a pretty impressive place,\" said former third baseman Scott Brosius. \"It's kind of cool to see it now, and it will be really cool to see it when it's all completed and ready to go.\"\nThat, of course, coming from a man who had already soaked in some of the best of what the old Yankee Stadium had to offer. So imagine how the children of local youth groups in the Bronx felt when the Yankees invited them to a symbolic ceremony on Saturday to transfer home plate, the pitching rubber and buckets of dirt from the old Yankee Stadium to the new one.\nBrosius, O'Neill, David Cone and Jeff Nelson joined members of Youth Force 2020 and the ACE Mentor Program in the ceremony, using shovels to dig up dirt and then set it back down across the street -- all in the midst of a driving rain.\n\"It means a lot,\" Cone said. \"It's a great symbolic gesture to be able to take the actual home plate and pitcher's rubber from the old Yankee Stadium and bring it over here. It was a great gesture, and to actually get kids in the Bronx involved with it, I thought was a really good thing to do.\"\nCone, like Brosius, spent a fair amount of time gazing up at the new stadium, which at once looks quite similar to and strikingly different from the old one. Set to open when the new baseball season begins in April, the structure has been rising up in the shadow of its predecessor for more than two years.\n\"There's a little twinge of jealousy, that's for sure, when you see this facility and how beautiful it's going to be,\" Cone said. \"But then again, I was at the right place at the right time.\"\n\"This new Yankee Stadium has got a lot to live up to,\" Cone said, lounging in a concrete lean-to that will soon become the home dugout. \"There are so many great memories, so many championships across the street, that anything you can bring over here -- any sort of memories you can bring with you -- it's a good thing to do to get this place off to the right start.\"And here are some pictures of the ceremony from MLB.com:\nTorre said he had been invited by the Yankees to a Saturday event at which Bronx high schoolers and a few members of the '98 team will transfer dirt from the home plate area at the old Yankee Stadium to the new Yankee Stadium. He's not going to make it due to a scheduling conflict with a brunch for his foundation, but it seemed like an olive branch of sorts.Nice of the Yanks to at least invite Torre to help with the ceremony, and like O'Brien says, it does seem like an olive branch. It's a shame he couldn't make it.\nThe third position presented in this year's Probabilistic Model of Range study belongs to centerfielders.

But the fact that Sabathia picked Jeter's brain should give the Yankees hope of landing the ace lefty.\n\"He's asked questions, yeah, about it,\" said Jeter, who got to know Sabathia as an opponent and All-Star Game teammate. \"I'll leave it at that.\n\"I'm not trying to sell anyone on New York. I don't think you have to sell people on playing in this organization. People have questions, but it's not like I have a sales pitch.\"Tim Dierkes of MLBTradeRumors.com told SNY.tv today that Sabathia will likely been signed quickly, and could be the first big name to be signed.

{"text": "When games slow and defenses tighten, grabbing offensive rebounds and making putbacks would seem to be a logical way to score, anyway. The data--albeit, extremely limited data--supports that theory.\nBased on Synergy's information about scoring immediately after offensive rebounds, there was no statistically significant correlation between percentage of misses converted into putbacks and Offensive Rating last regular season.\nThere was, however, a positive, statistically significant correlation between percentage of misses converted into putbacks and Offensive Rating* in the playoffs.\n*Because the quality of the defenses a team faces in the playoffs varies so much, I adjusted Offensive Rating. I determined a team's expected Offensive Rating by averaging its regular-season Offensive Rating with its opponents' regular-season Defensive Rating (weighted by number of games against each opponent). I subtracted the expected Offensive Rating from a team's actual playoff Offensive Rating.\nThat said, here's a huge caveat--those putback numbers are still from the regular season, because Synergy doesn't provide full data for the playoffs.\nDo teams that put back a large portion of their misses in the regular season continue to do so in the playoffs, and vice versa? I don't know.\nIt's important to note the importance of using putback data rather than relying on offensive-rebounding numbers to draw a similar conclusion. When a team grabs an offensive rebound and doesn't immediately shoot again, it faces a similar defensive challenge as it did for its first shot.\nLike I wrote above, logically, putbacks would increase in value when scoring in other ways becomes more difficult. As an expanded focus in advanced stats makes more numbers available in the mainstream, we'll learn whether the results match the logic. For now, consider this nothing more than a working theory.\nIf accurate, let's look at what the theory indicates about this year's playoffs.\nTeams in the upper two quadrants have above-average Offensive Ratings, and teams in the lower two quadrants have below-average Offensive Ratings. Teams in the right two quadrants convert an above average number of their misses into putbacks (indicating increased offensive success in the playoffs), and teams in the left two quadrants convert a below average number of their misses into putbacks (indicating decreased offensive success in the playoffs).\nI included teams that most likely will not make the playoffs, so you can see which teams' offenses might fit best in the playoffs if they improve overall in coming seasons (and keep the same style).", "id": "<urn:uuid:fe55c558-77b5-4c25-b4c2-416553e76eba>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=1563", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:48Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9568525552749634, "token_count": 508, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Of the six hitters who began Saturday tied for the most strikeouts in the National League, only one seems like he does not belong. Cameron Maybin and Jordan Schafer are both talented rookies getting acclimated to major league pitching. Prince Fielder is a slugger who struck out 135 times last season. Lance Berkman was bothered early by shoulder soreness. Mark Reynolds set a single-season record in 2008 by striking out 204 times.\nThat leaves David Wright, who has 19 strikeouts in 63 at-bats (73 plate appearances) this season – or one every 3.84 times up. Since 2006, Wright has gradually struck out less often – once every 5.85 plate appearances in 2006 to 6.18 in 2007 to 6.24 in 2008. But Manager Jerry Manuel and the hitting coach Howard Johnson have noticed that Wright has not looked quite right at the plate. Manuel said that Wright’s swing had gotten long and that he was “traveling” – or drifting – into the pitch rather than standing back and hitting it.\n“That’s an adjustment I think he can make because he’s done it before,” Manuel said. “In his best years, it didn’t look like he went anywhere, and there is the ball, right there. It’s almost – not quite – like Barry Bonds. David has to do the same thing.”\nWhenever Wright tends to scuffle, as he calls it, his hands tend to take a slow, circuitous path during his swing. With a longer swing, he is vulnerable to outside pitches, and he has struck out looking at his fair share. When Wright was off to a slow start in April 2007, Keith Hernandez told me that “a pitch on the outside corner is a pitch that most hitters love, but whenever anyone slumps, it looks like it’s third down and 40. It’s so far away.”\nBefore Saturday’s game against the Nationals, Manuel said: “It’s difficult to get to that pitch if you’re traveling, if you know what I’m saying. You can’t put a good swing on it.”\nStill, Wright began the day batting .302, so it is not as if he is at the Mendoza Line or anything, which Manuel has also noticed.\n“Right now, he’s just moving slightly,” Manuel said. “That’s hitting. That’s part of the art of hitting. And the thing about it, he’s still somewhat surviving. Shows just how good he can really be.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:bc577807-9180-4a79-a260-43c5a8212a33>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/david-wright-and-the-case-of-the-frequent-strikeout/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:22:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9739067554473877, "token_count": 556, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Harry Jerome Awards\nOn October 21, 1982, a meeting was held where a decision was made to form an association and a steering committee including Al Hamilton, publisher of Contrast Newspaper, Denham Jolly and Bromley Armstrong. Incorporated in July 1983, the Black Business and Professional Association (BBPA) is a non-profit charitable organization that serves to address equity and opportunity for the Black community in business, employment, education and economic development. Following the October 1982 meeting, it was decided to honour the six Black Canadian athletes who excelled at that year’s Commonwealth Games: Angela Taylor-Issanjenko, Ben Johnson, Mark McKoy, Milt Ottey, Tony Sharpe and Desai Williams.\nA dinner was suggested at which Harry Jerome, Canada’s premiere track and field athlete of the 1960s would be invited to be the keynote speaker. However, before he could be invited, Harry Jerome died suddenly in December 1982. The group then decided to turn the celebration into a tribute to Harry Jerome and an awards ceremony to honour the six athletes. The name “Harry Jerome Awards” was proposed by Hamlin Grange and so the first Harry Jerome Awards was held on March 5, 1983.\nThe Harry Jerome Awards is now a national event that recognizes and honours excellence in African Canadian achievement. In addition to the Harry Jerome Awards, the BBPA sponsors the Harry Jerome Scholarship Fund, providing financial support to African Canadian youth pursuing higher education. The idea for the Harry Jerome Scholarship Fund was provided by Hamlin Grange and realized through the efforts of Kamala-Jean Gopie, Pamela Appelt, Sheila Simpson and Beverly Mascoll. Journalist Cynthia Reyes was the BBPA’s president at the time. Under the leadership of Verlyn Francis, in 1996 the scholarship fund established an endowment fund and attracted corporate sponsorship. Today the Fund awards some thirty scholarships each year.\nFor more information, please visit our website at The Harry Jerome Awards Website", "id": "<urn:uuid:62035076-4164-4413-ab2e-fad2a86c461d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bbpa.org/events-programs/harry-jerome-awards/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:25:36Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9606969356536865, "token_count": 403, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "I liked the mixed vegetable side dish that was offered at Texas Roadhouse. It was really simple and crunchy. So, I tried to create it at home using the microwave. You can steam yours if you like but for me microwave is easier in this easy dish. You can omit the salt if you use salted butter and also you can replace the butter with extra virgin olive oil. When you use olive oil, just make sure you stir and mix the broccoli well with your hands before you put it in the microwave.\nThis is one easy side dish to serve with your American dinner.

This 6th grade teacher knows how to take math, add a little fun, and create videos that teach other kids hard mathematical concepts.\nBest Classroom Blog: 4KM and 4KJ @ Leopold Primary School - This blog was one of the first I ever discovered on the web. Last summer I met Mrs. Morris, one part of this team blog. These teachers never stop reaching for new and innovative ways to share what they are doing in the classroom.\nBest Student Blog: BB’s Awesome Blog There aren’t enough fabulous words to describe BB’s student blog. For two years BB has kept her blog going with charming and original weekly posts, with the help and support of her mom AA. Someday I am going to fly to Australia and meet this incredible family.\nLifetime Achievement Award: Sue Wyatt This Australian teacher retired last year, yet she continues to help students and teachers with the Student Blogging Challenges.

The word “heaps” is used in Australia when we say “lots”, such as lots of fun. Check him out in the Bird of Paradise plant in BB’s backyard!\nBB has been writing about his adventures and I hope you will visit her blog to find out all the details.\nPlease leave her a comment and let her know you visited. Here is the direct link to her blog.\nWhat do you think Pete should do while he is “down under”\nWhat season is it in Australia now?\nDo you think Bird of Paradise plants would grow in Seattle?\nWhy designate a month to picture books?\nDon’t we all love picture books already? The answer is simple. With the birth of eBooks, iPads, Kindles, Nooks and other online reading devices, many feel traditional printed picture books may be on the way out.\nThis is the 2nd annual celebration of Picture Book Month. Founder Dianne de Las Casa decided it was time to celebrate picture books in their printed format so she created an initiative to designate November as “Picture Book Month”.\nWe always celebrate picture books in our library. However, we have also added some art to the mix in our lessons. Here are the highlights of our week.\nWhat says Thanksgiving Day more than turkey, mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie?\nThe Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade!\nFor more than eighty-years, children young and old, have been delighted by the bobbing and swaying gigantic balloons that float down the streets of New York City in the parade.\nMelissa Sweet tells the true story of Tony Sarg, the puppeteer who was the inventor of the Macy’s parade balloons. After we read this book, some of the classes also made Balloons Over Broadway mini-boxes and finger puppets. You can get this activity and more at the Houghton-Mifflin website here.\nThanksgiving is a time to reflect and say thank you. While this book is not a traditional Thankgiving Day book talking about the Mayflower and pilgrims, it is a book about the importance of thanking friends for all the things they do for each of us.\nIn first grade, we used the Splat the Cat Activity Kit and added a fall leaf. Students wrote what they are thankful for during this holiday season.\nIf you want to read a funny chapter book to entertain you during the Thanksgiving holiday week, pick up a copy of Junie B., First Grader: Turkeys We Have Loved and Eaten (and Other Thankful Stuff). Find out how cranberry sauce in a can, exploding biscuits and rainbow sprinkles relate to Thankgiving and first graders. I guarantee this book will have you laughing in minutes!\nThe last book I want to include this week is Hello, Hello by Matthew Cordell. I think every family needs to add this book to their collection. In fact, Matthew has a blogpost listing 26 reasons why every family needs to read this book. You can read that post here.\nIt’s a story of what we really need to remember as we move forward into a very connected, very digital age.\nUsing simple text, charming watercolor illustrations, and animals in unusual places (flying fish and whales in the sky?), Cordell tells the story of Lydia, who helps her family remember that there is a time and place for electronics.\nFor a few minutes in the upcoming days, I hope you will set your gadget aside, and go outside to jump in those leaves and have some silly, crazy, outside fun!\nWhat is your favorite balloon in the Macy’s Day parade?\nWhat friend would you by thankful for this month?\nWhat gadget could you give up for a day?\nWe have a new President!\nYesterday the American voters re-elected Barack Obama to serve as our President for another four years. Our blog poll had the same results!\nIf you would like to read more about President Obama or his family, we have three biographies available in the library. They are located on the biography (921 OBA) shelf.\nGiven the chance to meet any of the First Family face to face, what question would you ask?\n(President Obama, Michelle Obama, Malia or Sasha)\nToday is Tuesday, November 6, 2012.\nIn the USA, that means it’s also our election day!\nEvery four years, voters have the opportunity to cast their ballot and vote for who they want to be president on our country. Registered voters choose the person who best matches their beliefs. They can either vote in person or by mail. In our area of Washington state, voters can only vote by mail. Voters receive a special ballot in the mail, fill it out and send it back.\nWe have two main candidates running for President of the United States. This year we have an incumbent, President Barack Obama, who is a democrat.The word incumbent in politics refers to the person who already holds this office.\nIf re-elected, President Obama will serve for another four years and then he will not be able to run again. We have a time limit of eight years as president in our country.\nPresident Obama is running against former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is a Republican. If Mr. Romney is elected, he will serve for four years and then have the chance to be re-elected in 2016.\nTo vote, you must be a US citizen, at least 18 years old and be a registered voter. You can watch a short Scholastic video here that explains more about the candidates and the election.\nA great book called, So You Want to Be President by Judith St. George describes the some of the lesser known facts about the men who have been our Presidents.\nFor example, did you know that six Presidents were named James? Or that Benjamin Harrison had eleven brothers and sisters?\nThis book is available in our library. It won the Caldecott award in 2001 for its illustrations by David Small. The call number is 973.09\nIf you want to keep up with the news of the election, you can visit most any of the news websites, such as CNN.\nWe will also have our own poll on our library blog. It will be open until midnight on election day. I wonder how our results will compare to the official results!\nDo you love to play dominoes? Do you enjoy the clink, clink, clink as dominoes topple in black and white lines? If so, pick up a copy of Toppling by Sally Murphy. Josa donated a copy for our library and wrote the following book review!\nJohn is the main character of this book. He is a boy with an unusual hobby–he likes to set up dominoes and tip th first one and watch them topple in complicated patterns. John’s goal is to win the world record of toppling. then something happens to make John’s world start to topple. His best friend Dominic gets very, very sick. This is a one-of-a-kind story about change, coping and friendship. This is a book for ages 8+ or anyone who wants a good read. It is illustrated very nicely.\nYou can find Toppling by Sally Murphy in the realistic section of our library!\nHere is the call number: F MUR Realistic\nHave you every played the game dominoes?\nWhat have you built using dominoes?\nSkyping! Skyping! I’m SO glad someone invented Skyping!\nToday Ms. Holder’s library class skyped with author Stephen McCranie. Stephen is the author of the Mal and Chad graphic novel series.\nInstead of having the author come to our school, we visited with him virtually.\nA few weeks ago Mrs. Hembree found out on Twitter that Stephen was offering to skype with teachers and librarians. She signed up and our school is one of over 70 schools Stephen will “virtually” visit this fall.\nDuring the call we watched him draw on his computer. First he taught us that comics are stories + pictures.\nThen to develop our own story, he had us answer two questions:\n- What does my character want?\n- What is preventing my character from getting what he or she wants?\nWe decided that our character, Tara, wanted to own a bakery, but her family wasn’t very supportive of that idea. She ran away, met a baker and learned how to become the baker she always wanted to be.\nAfter that we had a quick demonstration on how to draw a picture. We learned it’s easy if you use shapes like circles, squares or triangles. As Stephen drew on his computer, we tried to guess what famous characters he was drawing!\nIn the last portion of our visit, Stephen asked us to start a story. Then before our eyes, he drew a scene from our story.\nWhile he was drawing, he also answered our questions.\nWe found out that he has loved comics since he was about 5 years old. He drew his first comic strip for a school newspaper in college. He likes comics because they are a great way to express yourself. They are an artform with a lot of potential.\nHe reads lots and lots of books and really enjoys the Bone series by Jeff Smith. Stephen said he believes that creativity is like a muscle in your head. When you practice you get better over time. If you want to get better at drawing , you need to draw and practice every single day. The tools for drawing don’t really matter. Pencils, crayons, pens – use whatever you want and draw, draw, draw.\nWe will be sure to buy a few copies for the library! After about 30 minutes, our time was up! It was a great first Author Skype experience! Thank you Stephen for visiting the Bulldog Readers! If you are looking for Stephen’s books, here they are. We have both available for check out in the library. You can also link to his Mal and Chad website here.\nWhat do you think our story was about?\nHave you ever skyped with anyone? Do you like it?\nWhat is your favorite graphic novel or comic series?\nPete the Cat is a good friend of Mrs. Hembree. This weekend he came home with her so he wouldn’t be lonely sitting in the library all weekend.\nOn Saturday morning, Mrs. Hembree got up and walked into the dining room.\nWhat did she see?\nPete the Cat was stuffing himself into a really big envelope!\n“What are you doing Pete?” she asked. Pete started singing!\n“Where are you traveling to Pete? I see there are some letters on the envelope. Does that say Australia?” Mrs. Hembree asked Pete.\n“YES! Australia!” Pete exclaimed! “I’m going to Australia and I’m singing this song!”\n“Pete, won’t you be scared? Australia is a long way from Seattle! It’s not even in North America!” said Mrs. Hembree.\n“NO!” he shouted! “I won’t be scared! I’m going to see my friend and I’ll be singing my song!”\n“Tell me Pete, how did you decide to go to Australia? Do you know someone there?” asked Mrs. Hembree.\nPete said, “Do you know BB our Blogging Buddy? She asked me if I could come visit! So I decided since it started raining here, that I would visit her in Australia.\nDid you know Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere? When it’s fall here, it’s sunny and warm there because it’s springtime! I’m going to have fun and I’m going to be singing my song!”\n“Ok Pete. It sounds like you know what you want to do and who you want to see! Let’s go to the post office and get you on the road!” Mrs. Hembree said.\n“Thanks Mrs. Hembree! Don’t forget! I’m going to see BB and I’ll be singing my song!” Pete waved goodbye and was gone in a flash. She could hear in the background faint sounds of his song…..\nOh no! Australia is a long way from here!\nDo you think he will get lost?\nWill he have fun?\nWill he get back in time to go to Prague?\nLeave us a comment and let us know what you think!\nIt’s mid-October. The leaves are turning. The days are getting shorter and the nights colder. Are you looking for a new book? Check out what Angela drew for the library yesterday!\nMaybe you are thinking that it’s getting close to Halloween and you want a spooky book to thrill your reading time!\nSpooky stories are always popular with some students (not me – I get nightmares). This past weekend when I was in Yakima at Washington librarian conference I had the opportunity to listen to the author Royce Buckingham talk about his love of scary books and movies!\nRoyce shared how the movie Jaws was particularly scary when he was a kid! I remember seeing it too and I didn’t swim in the ocean for a month afterward! However, he loves scary monsters and books like that, which is why he now is both an attorney and a writer of spooky stories.\nDo you remember seeing the photos from when Hitu visited the Jaws set last summer and did a little reading in Jaws! This is the movie Royce is talking about! Yikes! That is a scary photo!\nIf you love this kind of book come in soon and check out the new books by Royce Buckingham.\nYou don’t have to like monsters to like all the new books in the library! Look at this selection available! From graphics to humor to fantasy or mystery we have something new for you!\nVisiting Yakima was a lot of fun! I had a chance to talk with lots of other librarians and share ideas with them. If you are a teacher librarian looking for a link to my slides, here you go!\nDo you like to read spooky stories?\nHave you seen Jaws at Universal Studios?\nWhat new book will you want to read?\nCongratulations and thank you everyone who made our annual bookfair a screaming success!\nAlso, between sales at the fair and sales online, we are at 103% of our\nfundraising goal! That means that I will be book shopping in the upcoming weeks for\nnew books to add to our library.\nThis is the stack I already purchased from the fair. If there is a book you absolutely must check out, leave me a reserve copy slip and I will get it to you as quickly as I can.\nMany, many thanks to our bookfair volunteers! Without their help, our fair would not have been such a great success! Here is our STAR CAST of volunteers!\nMr. Fornia’s kindergarten class also deserves a Super Special Shout-out! His class had the most online sales of any teacher at our school! Way to go Mr. Fornia’s class! Everyone is getting a SUPER STAR bookmark! Woo-hoo!\nWhen I named this post Thank You Near and Far, it’s because of our blogging friends thousands of miles away from here. I want to give a terrific thank you to BB and her mom AA in Australia! On Friday when I got home from school, I found this in my mailbox!\nInside was this…..\nI love my new Geelong Cats hat. This is an Australian “football” team. In the US, we call it “rugby” and in Australia, they call it football! Talk about confusing!\nSomehow BB found out that I love jewelry too, because she sent this beautiful bracelet.\nSomehow the words thank you don’t seem like enough for such a special package of gifts! The blogging friendship we have developed across the miles is dear to my heart. I hope someday we will meet in person! In the mean time, I have some new decorations in the library!\nAnd, last, but not least is a present I received from Penny! We have been reading Pete the Cat books and singing his songs in kindergarten. One morning Penny walked into the library before school started with this picture.\n“Do you know who this is?” she asked me.\n“It’s Pete the Cat and his SEVEN groovy buttons!” I replied.\nThank you Penny for taking the time to make this drawing! It’s hanging in a special spot on our library wall!\nWhat books or series do we need to add to the library?\nTell me about a special package you got in the mail!\nWhat should Pete the Cat do next?", "id": "<urn:uuid:3c6b2641-10ce-4765-a46c-793ab132959e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bellbulldogreaders.edublogs.org/author/juliehembree/page/4/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:01:53Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9609940648078918, "token_count": 4351, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "What Will “Post-Artifact Books” Mean For the Library?Posted: 14 Jun 2011\nThis is the post-artifact system. A system of unlocking. A system concerned with engagement. Sharing. Marginalia. Ownership. Community. And, of course, reading. - Craig Mod\nThis morning Craig Mod published another beautiful and thought-provoking essay called Post-Artifact Books and Publishing: Digital’s effect on how we produce, distribute and consume content. Like his other writings, this essay examines the future of the book vis-a-vis traditional and new publishing models. The essay addresses ideas about social reading, where and how books will live and the best format for digital books. All said, it is a sprawling but inclusive essay that, I think, all librarians need to read. Now.\nIn the opening Mod quotes Matthew Battles Library: An Unquiet History. After that little is expressly mentioned about libraries, forgivable since Mod, primarily a writer, publisher and designer, is not a librarian nor writing about what role they should play in shaping the future of books. However, the essay contains concepts that libraries are going to struggle with in the near future (if they are not already struggling with them now).\nA few questions:\nLibraries have always been somewhat social but what happens when the social is moved to the digital realm? How can libraries be a part of this. More importantly, how can libraries shape and connect this?\nMod points to several examples of how books are being created and published by alternative publishing formats largely through reader interaction. How can libraries be sure that these important books that are either POD or produced by smaller publishers are made available?\nWhat are libraries doing to help shape the new systems in which books and ideas will be distributed? Working for rather than reacting to (or against)?\nHow can libraries promote the de-emphasis of authority surrounding access to information and materials?", "id": "<urn:uuid:89f789e0-48ba-43f2-a3a8-8fdb2f5f9798>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://benjaminlainhart.com/2011/06/14/what-will-post-artifact-books-mean-for-the-library/?like=1&_wpnonce=9d779cb1c0", "date": "2013-05-18T06:19:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9499785900115967, "token_count": 397, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Timothy Hart remembers being curious about local history even as a youngster growing up in Stafford.\n\"I grew up near an old railroad right-of-way, and I always wondered what had been there,\" said Hart, who graduated from Southern Regional in 1972. In those days, Ocean County was only beginning to feel the impact of the Garden State Parkway. And that right-of-way? That's where Route 72 is now, Hart said.\nHart's love of history has now landed him in a role he could only dream of: That of county historian for Ocean County. Hart, who serves as the director of the county's Cultural and Heritage Commission, was appointed county historian by the Ocean County Board of Freeholders on Wednesday afternoon.\nHart succeeds Pauline S. Miller, who has been the county's only historian previously. She died in December at age 93.\n\"His love for the history of this great county makes him the perfect choice for county historian,\" Freeholder John C. Bartlett said. \"Tim has extensive knowledge of the county's history. He is an expert when it comes to the role Barnegat Bay plays in county history, in addition to how historical events like the Civil War had an impact on this county.\"\nThe title carries no salary, but Hart said he is very happy to be chosen for the post.\n\"It's quite an honor,\" said Hart, who also serves as deputy director of the Tuckerton Seaport and Baymen's Museum in Little Egg Harbor.\nHart, who serves as Stafford Township's historian, has been a member of the Stafford Township Historical Society since his childhood. His Linked-in profile lists historical organization after historical organization, going back to high school. A theology major at Georgetown, he minored in history, while majoring in theology at Georgetown. He later attended law school and passed the bar in the early 2000s.\nHart not only studies history, however; he participates yearly in the reenactment of the battle at Cedar Bridge Tavern, site of an important Revolutionary War skirmish.\nHart said he does not see himself as the kind of historian Miller was.\n\"I don't know everything,\" he said, but instead he knows who to ask for the answers. That includes a vast wealth of town historians throughout Ocean County, whom Hart intends to get to know in the coming weeks and months.\n\"It's my fantasy to tour each of the towns with their historians and have them point out, 'This used to such-and-such,' \" Hart said.\n\"We live in such a homogenized society, with all the McDonald's and Walmarts and such,\" Hart said. \"When you know about the local history, it makes it kind of a special place.\"\nAnd that right-of-way that Hart grew up near?

{"text": "App for That\n“The purpose of this blog is to provide sourcing for texts quoted by @Horse_ebooks and, whenever possible, provide context,” wrote freelancer Jack Stuef on a freshly-minted Tumblr conceived in the bleary midnight hours early Friday morning. Born out of that insomniac haze is “The Annotated @Horse_ebooks,” a blog devoted to teasing out nuance and substance from the glorious fountain of non-sequitors that is the Internet’s favorite Twitter account, @Horse_ebooks.\n“The idea to do a Tumblr just came to me, but I had looked up some of Horse’s tweets before, and sometimes the sources of those can be just as bizarre and hilarious as the tweets themselves. Or they can be incredibly dull. I thought it was interesting,” Mr. Stuef, who frequently writes for The Onion and BuzzFeed, told Betabeat via Gchat.\nKickstart or Kill\nFor every snazzy hardware idea and genuinely inspiring artistic project, there’s also a whole lot of crap clogging up crowdfunding sites. This has not escaped the attention of the acerbic wits at the Onion News Network. And so the site’s latest video turns its knives on Kickstarter, dubbing it “an insidious new Internet scam,” roping people into donating to projects that are “in actuality, just terrible useless garbage.”\nDuring lunch on Mother’s Day, my own mom had some exciting news to announce: “I’m reading the best book!” she declared, taking a sip from her sweating water glass in the building May heat. “It’s called How To Be Black. It’s excellent–hilarious, but also serious,” she insisted.\nI had heard of it only in passing–on Twitter, and in scant Facebook posts. It was written by The Onion‘s Director of Digital and Internet Man About Town Baratunde Thurston, and had received almost five stars–a perfect score–from users on Amazon.\n“There were like 56 reviews last time I checked,” Mr. Thurston told Betabeat by phone this morning. “And I’m like, ‘Who’s the asshole that didn’t put five stars?’ Clearly it’s a five-star book.”\nEver since news broke last year that satirical news source The Onion was shutting down their New York office and heading to Chicago, The Atlantic reports that the core team of staffers has pursued every avenue to keep the company from heading west. One bizarre but apparently legitimate option was to have startup non-incubator Betaworks buy The Onion.\nIn college, this reporter once took a “new media” class where the professor let loose a terrifying edict: As homework, we would not be allowed to use any Google products for the entire week. That meant no Google search, no Gmail, no Gcal… nothing.\nThe experiment was supposed to teach us just how reliant we were upon one company for many of a college student’s basic needs, like learning, communicating and organizing.\nIt was not the darkest hour of this reporter’s life, but it was a very, very dark one.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2531fdd4-9156-4bbc-a58c-124e5f05a567>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://betabeat.com/tag/the-onion/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:56Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9567961096763611, "token_count": 705, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

I’ve now landed on the idea that content is still king, but it’s a particular kind of content now: relationship-driven content. So it’s not that relationships are now king and content has been dethroned; it’s that the kind of content that rules the Internet has gotten more specific. Relationship-driven content is content that invites and encourages sharing, commenting, forwarding, and other forms of interaction.\nContent in speaking or in writing that gives the audience a voice has more power than static content.\n(Photo credit: Flickr user JDHancock)", "id": "<urn:uuid:30dd2c3c-3ff2-4f3c-ab63-8feb36c6722d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://betterrhetoric.com/2012/05/19/the-king-is-dead-long-live-the-king/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:19:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9096613526344299, "token_count": 165, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Technical/Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

I will caper for your amusement.\nNintendo sent me an email to tell me my incentive prize was on the way. It will be here in 4 to 10 business days. That’s a pretty impressive amount of leeway. Especially considering the several days it took to process the transaction. Honestly they could have just said “We’re Nintendo. We’ll get it to you when we damn well feel like it.” It doesn’t bother me either way. At some future date I’ll have my mediocre award.\nThat new Harry Potter movie should be out soon, if it’s not already. I’ve seen all the others in the theatre, so I’ll probably try to see this one too.\nThankfully the kids that like Potter stuff have all grown along with it, so I don’t feel so creepy if I go to a movie that skews much younger than I am. Being the lone old guy at a kids movie is awkward. As an animation enthusiast it’s something I’ve had to deal with pretty much since I was a teenager. I like the new tendency for people to not grow out of things like they used to. People older than me still play video games regularly. Roleplaying games are no longer the domain of the young. Guys I went to school with never gave up on Magic: The Gathering. David Willis masturbates nightly to the Transformers wiki. I think the world is slowly becoming populated with grown children. Neverland is more than just the palatial estate of the departed king of pop. Weather that’s good for the world is debatable, but it does make a trip to the cinema easier for me.\nEdit: Because the universe has a sense of humor my Club Nintendo prize showed up this very day.

{"text": "Food of the Gods from the Island of the Gods\nWe work directly with over 3,000 farmers farmers on the islands of Bali and Sumatra to procure our fine cacao.\nThe history of the Bali Cacao is linked to the history of the legendary Java Criollo, which is linked to the Philippines, which is directly linked to the cacao the Spanish brought there from the legendary Aztec cacao orchards of Soconusco, Mexico.\nThese genetics that made their way into Indonesia were dominantly planted on old Dutch plantations found on East Java. These same genetics that were so highly regarded were also planted on the next island over, Bali. As the chocolate industry become more industrialized in the mid 1900’s and production output replaced quality of flavor, the plantations started to replace the Java Criollo with hybrids that increased the volume of cacao per hectare.\nFortunately, the island of Bali was mostly ignored during the hybridization period. This is probably due to the fact that villages and small family farms populated these smaller islands, not plantations. In the mid 1900’s, Bali was nothing like it is today; it was still quite forgotten and remote. Today, many of Bali’s farms still remain as they were. The cacao is grown interspersed with other food crops such as, vanilla, exotic peppercorns, passion fruit, banana, jackfruit, palm trees and mangosteen. We refer to these as “food forests”.\nThe Health of it All\nCacao is PACKED with natural compounds called antioxidants. More than blueberries, pomegranate, cranberries and even red wine. Yet, all these fruits and drinks are great for a healthy diet and lifestyle.\nPromotes good cardiovascular health. Cacao is one of the best sources of natural magnesium, which is critical for a happy and healthy heart. Perhaps this is why its such a lovers food..\nPromotes good blood circulation. Theobromine is a superior vascodilator, which means more oxygen gets pumped into your bloodstream, making it a great food for exercise.\nLowers blood pressure.\nRich in minerals. Cacao is a seed which contains many vital minerals our body needs to function optimally.\nThere is so much more that we can go on for pages with the positive health benefits of cacao and chocolate. Yet, we are sure you know most of the good news already... you just need to get some in your mouth now!", "id": "<urn:uuid:4b4863e4-f53c-4d42-88dc-84d71101f688>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bigtreefarms.com/index.php/page/content/1/29", "date": "2013-05-18T06:55:20Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9647335410118103, "token_count": 521, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "USE’s Sumo Carbon seatpost looks great with a smart carbon fibre weave post. USE’s own neat one-bolt clamp holds the saddle securely and doesn’t slip or creak.\nThe Sumo one-bolt clamp gives the seatpost its name. The head and clamp pieces are forged and CNC-machined from 7075 aluminium and take 7mm rails. Clamps are also available for fatter rails. Angle adjustments are laser etched on the clamp.\nUSE fits a 4mm Allen bolt so you need to be careful when tightening the clamp. We’d recommend using a torque wrench to avoid over-tightening it.\nThe head is bonded to a full carbon shaft with smart printed decals. Its 400mm length is generous and should mean it will fit a raft of bikes including very compact frames that need a lot of post to get the right saddle height. It’s available in the most common sizes 27.2, 30.9, 31.6 and 34.9mm.\nThere’s 10mm of layback but it’s a shame USE don’t offer an inline option for those that might not need that much layback.\nWe’ve been battering the seatpost through hundreds of miles including several long distance marathon races and the post has stood up just fine. The clamp has proved solid and reliable with no saddle slippage or readjustment necessary throughout the test period.\nThanks to the flex that you can build in with a carbon fibre shaft, t’s a comfortable post for long distance riding as well. That’s a unique advantage of carbon posts: try and make an aluminium post this flexible and it’ll fatigue to death in no time.\nIt’s a good looking seatpost too which matters for an item that is on such prominent show.\nWeight is good at 232g for our 30.8mm sample, which isn’t far off the claimed weight. It’s far from the troubling the lightest sub-200g posts but its durability and comfort won us over.\nA light, strong and comfortable British-designed seatpost.\nEasy clamp setup\nThere are cheaper carbon seatposts\nPrice (for 30.8mm): £89.99\nMore information: USE Sumo Carbon Seat Post\nWhat USE says about the Sumo Carbon seat post\nThe SUMO seat post is engineered to take a pounding and go the distance. The highly acclaimed, quick fitting, simple to adjust clamp design ensures the perfect saddle position. The SUMO is equally at home in Marathon events, TransMtn, Freeride (lite), as it is pounding out the cobbles in the heart of Europe. The SUMO is the first choice for riders who need a lightweight dependable seat post.\nThe SUMO Carbon is used by World-class athletes through to amateurs in Multiple MTB World Cup events, developed for fastest, toughest riders on the planet.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5a91ae32-8e85-47ae-9c93-70ff789de33d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bikemagic.com/gear/reviews/use-sumo-carbon-seat-post-review.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:39Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9215747714042664, "token_count": 618, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
